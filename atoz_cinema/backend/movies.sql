Twenty years later, an older Michael (William Janney) attempts to enter the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC), but cannot overcome his boyhood fear of thunderstorms and is "washed out". His friend Cecil Dunbar (Glen Boles) persuades a dejected Michael to come to a party hosted by crippled war veteran Raoul McGuire (Jason Robards Sr.). Michael meets McGuire''s sister, Molly (Rosalind Keith), who confides that her brother is engaged in criminal activities.
Michael''s older brother, now in the U.S. Department of Justice and assuming the name "Jim Lofton", has protected his identity from his family and others, by circulating the cover story that he was killed in the war. Lofton''s assignment is to arrest Raoul McGuire, his old flying buddy and the man who once saved his life.

The Colonel, a fellow deserter, appears from the brush with a note from an Indian who has arranged to take him to the ocean so he may be taken to Cuba. When the Indian guide is found dead by Seminoles, the foursome reluctantly join forces with the Colonel in order to reach the coast and ride out the rest of the Civil War.
As the group treks through the dangerous Florida everglades, it''s revealed that Plunkett has stolen a large amount of gold from the Confederate army, which Cockney wants to steal from him. The group continues its trek, and it is revealed Cockney is drop-dead afraid of snakes, and being in close contact with them sends him into a paralyzed state. Cockney also reveals that the Colonel deserted after giving drunk orders during the Battle of Murfreesboro, leading to a slaughter. A drought ensues, and when the group reaches water, they also find two dead fellow deserters, killed by Seminoles. The Colonel wishes to bury them, but the foursome disagrees, citing the danger of nearby Seminoles. However, the Kid changes their minds. Soon after, the Colonel begins experiencing troubles, getting a fever, and hallucinating. The group sees smoke, and the Sergeant (the leader of the group) goes to investigate and is attacked by a panther. The rest of the group follows and encounters a seemingly abandoned Seminole settlement. The Colonel, in his deranged state, charges head first into the encampment and is shot by an arrow. The Sergeant rejoins the group and they are attacked by Seminoles. Though they escape, the Colonel dies that evening. After the Colonel''s death, the Sergeant declares that it''s every man for himself. 
The rest of the group soldiers on, heading towards the ocean. Cockney is killed when the group accidentally stumbles upon a nest of rattlesnakes, and he trips and falls into them. Plunkett becomes increasingly strained and paranoid out of fatigue. The remaining trio is forced to cross a river filled with alligators, which they successfully do. Upon getting to the other side, Plunkett offers the Sergeant his gold (as he has provided his safety for the duration of the trip) and finds only rocks in his satchel. Concluding that Cockney stole his gold, he dives back into the river and is eaten by the alligators.
Only the Kid and the Sergeant remain. They venture further and further, but after a heartfelt conversation where the Sergeant regrets running from all his problems, he steps into quicksand. Though the Kid attempts to save him, he is consumed by the sand. The Kid freaks out, running madly through the forest while hearing the voices of his dead comrades. The heartfelt talk about running away returns to him, however, and in the final sequence, the Kid finally reaches the ocean.','["R. John Hugh"]','["Nat S. Linden","R.

On the bus he encounters a crook, "Muggsy" Dolan who calls himself Jack Leach (Walter Sande). Jack is on the run from the law, and is looking for a safe place to hide. The two men come to talking and Freckles mentions his serene home town to Jack, having only good things to say about it. Jack decides to tag along and take his refuge in Freckles home town. With Freckles help he gets to stay at the local hotel, owned by Danny Doyle (Marvin Stephens), who is Freckles’ friend. Danny is about to rerun the road through town, so that it runs over a number of worthless lots of land he has bought. Danny bought the real estate because he thought he could find gold on them, using a new expensive device he has bought. Danny needs Freckles to help him get a favorable decision by Freckles’ father (Irving Mitchell), who is one of the two road commissioners.
When Jack’s crooked friend Nate Quigley (Bradley Page) arrives in town, he pretends to be interested in buying lots from Danny, in order to pull a scam on him. Danny gets a green light for the road development, but Jack is found dead in his hotel room. Constable Weaver (Irving Bacon) gets suspicious. Freckles, who has fallen in love with Jane Potter (Gale Storm), his childhood friend, suspects the newcomer Quigley of the deed, but doesn’t seem to convince anyone else.

She is caught and brought home where Martha''s tutor, Walter O''Neil, presents his timid son, Walter Jr., as the one responsible for Martha''s recovery. Scolded by her aunt, Martha defiantly states her name is not Ivers, but Smith, her father''s name. 
During a power failure, Sam comes for her, but Martha''s aunt hears her calling to him from downstairs. While Sam slips out unnoticed, Mrs. Ivers starts beating Martha''s kitten with her cane. Martha wrestles it away from her and strikes her across the head, causing her to fall down the staircase and die. When the power comes back on, Martha lies about the incident to Walter. Walter Jr. saw everything, but backs her up. The greedy Walter makes it clear to both Walter Jr. and Martha that he knows what happened, but that as long as he and his son stand to benefit, he will play along. Sam leaves town.
In 1946, the elder Walter is now dead. Walter Jr. is now Iverstown''s district attorney and is married to Martha, who has used her inheritance to expand the Ivers milling empire. Their marriage is one-sided; he loves her, but Walter knows that she does not love him. 
Sam, now a former soldier and itinerant gambler, drives into the small town by chance and, after an accident, leaves his car to be repaired. While waiting, he goes to look at his old home, now a boarding house. He meets Antonia "Toni" Marachek, who has just been released from jail. She is later picked up for violating her probation by not returning to her hometown. Sam goes to see Walter to see if he can use his influence to get her released.
Walter is convinced Sam has blackmail in mind. Sam learns that Walter''s father presented Martha''s version of the 1928 accidental murder to the police: that an intruder murdered Martha''s aunt; and that with his leverage he made Martha marry his son. When the police identified a former employee of the aunt as the murderer, the two Walters and Martha helped convict him, and he was hanged. 
When Martha reacts with joy at seeing Sam, a jealous Walter forces Toni to set him up. Sam is beaten up and driven out of town, but he is too tough to be intimidated. When all else fails, Walter makes a halfhearted attempt to kill Sam himself, but is easily disarmed. Martha then inadvertently blurts out the couple''s fears of blackmail, only to learn that Sam did not witness the death. Martha breaks down and laments that he left without her all those years ago, taking with him her only chance for love and freedom. 
Sam is torn between his old love and his new one with Toni. Although he eventually forgives Toni for betraying him, he and Martha spend an idyllic day together, rekindling his feelings for her. 
Walter arranges to meet Sam to finally settle matters. Before Sam arrives, Walter gets drunk and Martha finds out about the meeting. When Walter falls down the stairs, Martha urges Sam to kill her unconscious husband. Sam instead brings Walter around. Martha pulls out a gun and threatens to shoot Sam in "self defense" as an intruder. Sam tells her it would work, if she can get Walter to corroborate her story. Sam turns his back on her and leaves.
Walter embraces and kisses Martha, then points the gun at her midriff. Oddly relieved, she puts her hand over his hand on the trigger and presses. As she is dying, she defiantly states her name is not Martha Ivers, but Martha Smith. Outside, Sam hears the shot. He runs back toward the mansion, but sees Walter, holding Martha''s body, shoot himself. Sam and Toni drive away together.','["Lewis Milestone"]','["Robert Rossen","John Patrick"]','["Barbara Stanwyck","Van Heflin","Lizabeth Scott"]','["Drama","Film-Noir","Romance"]','7.4','["tt0041968","tt0040823","tt0033891","tt0039305","tt0040695","tt0038057","tt0044789","tt0041239","tt0041368","tt0042369","tt0045932","tt0039926"]','["Martha Ivers, Lewis Milestone, Stanwyck, Kirk Douglas"]','[{"url":"/Martha_Ivers.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Martha_Ivers_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/VTS_01_1.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/VTS_01_1_512Kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/VTS_01_2.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/VTS_01_2_512Kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/VTS_01_3.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/VTS_01_3_512Kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/VTS_01_4.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/VTS_01_4_512Kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','Martha_Ivers',53884,'Q971265','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Buster enlarges the opening a bit, but when he tows the boat out, it proves to be a bit bigger than he estimated, and the house collapses, utterly.
Buster loses his car during the attempt to launch the boat. The boat passes with impunity under the exceedingly low bridges of the Venice (California) canals thanks to Buster''s boat design. While out on the Pacific, Buster and his family are caught in a terrible storm. The boat is barely seaworthy to begin with, and it does not help that Buster nails a picture up inside the boat, causing an improbable leak, or when he further drills through the bottom of the boat to let the water out (resulting in a spectacular gusher of a leak). He radios a Morse Code call for help, but when the navy or coast guard operator asks who it is, he answers, "d-a-m-f-i-n-o" (in Morse Code). The man interprets it as "damn if I know" and dismisses the call as a prank. Taking to a (ridiculously small) dinghy (that is in fact a bathtub), the family resign themselves to the fact that they will sink into the sea, only to discover that the water is in fact only two feet deep. After a short walk through the water Buster and his family happen upon a deserted beach in dark of night.

With all the money Captain Crewe can offer, Miss Minchin gives Sara a fancy, private room.
Although worried about her father, Sara is distracted by riding lessons. It is during these riding lessons that Sara helps contrive meetings between Miss Rose, her teacher, and Mr. Geoffrey, the riding instructor, who is also the grandson of the mean-spirited next door neighbor, Lord Wickham. Sara hears news that Mafeking is free and expects her father will soon come home. Miss Minchin throws Sara a lavish birthday party. During the party, Captain Crewe''s solicitor (E. E. Clive) arrives with the sad news that Captain Crewe has died and his real estate, the basis for his wealth, has been confiscated. Miss Minchin ends Sara''s party abruptly. Without her father''s financial support, Sara becomes a servant, now working at the school she used to attend. Sara gains new solace in a friendship with Ram Dass (Cesar Romero) who lives next door.  She also receives support from Miss Minchin''s brother, Hubert, who does not agree with her treatment. Miss Rose and Mr. Geoffrey are found out and fired. Geoffrey joins the military.
In her new role, Sara gets hungrier and more tired from her arduous duties and sneaks off to veterans'' hospitals, convinced her father is not dead. After a string of episodes, including a performance of the film''s most well-known song "Knocked ''em in the Old Kent Road", Sara is at her wits end. Things start to worsen, when Sara gets into an argument with Miss Minchin, who cannot tolerate her faith in believing her father is still alive and tries forcing her to face reality. She later receives taunting from Lavinia (Marcia Mae Jones) the next day, eventually causing her to lose her temper and dump ashes on her. Miss Minchin arrives in the attic to punish Sara for "hurting" Lavinia. She discovers blankets that Ram Dass left Sara, assumes they are stolen, and locks her in the attic, calling the police. Sara escapes and runs to the hospital with Minchin in hot pursuit.
Meanwhile, the hospital is preparing to transfer a newly arrived patient, who is unable to communicate except to repeatedly say, "Sara, Sara"; it is Captain Crewe, but "his papers have been lost" and no one knows who he is. Sara is initially barred from entering the hospital but sneaks in, only to burst in upon a visit by Queen Victoria, who grants her permission to search for her father. During her search, she is reunited with a wounded Mr. Geoffrey and Miss Rose. Sara searches the wards unsuccessfully, but happens upon her father as she hides from Miss Minchin and the police.
Miss Minchin, who pursued Sara to the hospital, is appalled that her brother thinks Sara is innocent. A staff member announces Sara has found her father, Miss Minchin exclaims: "Captain Crewe is alive?!" to which her brother retorts, "Of course he''s alive! How could she find him if he wasn''t alive?"

He is brought to a man identifying himself only as "R", who asks him to undertake a secret mission: to identify and eliminate a German agent on his way to Arabia to stir up trouble in the Middle East. Upon agreeing, Brodie is given a new identity (Richard Ashenden), a fake death, and the assistance of a killer known variously as "the Hairless Mexican" and "the General" (Lorre), though he is neither bald, Mexican nor a general.
Brodie''s late "predecessor" thought that the enemy agent was staying at the Hotel Excelsior in neutral Switzerland. When "Ashenden" arrives there, he is surprised to find that "R" has also provided him with an attractive wife, Elsa Carrington (Carroll). Entering their suite, he also encounters her new admirer, fellow hotel guest Robert Marvin (Young), who is only slightly deterred by the arrival of her husband (and continues to flirt with Elsa for much of the film). When they are alone, Ashenden is displeased when Elsa reveals she insisted upon the assignment for the thrill of it.
Ashenden and the General go to contact a double agent, the church organist, only to find him dead. In his hand, however, they find a button, evidently torn off in the struggle. When they go to the casino to meet Elsa, the button is accidentally dropped onto a gambling table. Since it looks the same as his own buttons, an experienced mountaineer named Caypor assumes it is his.
The agents persuade Caypor to help them settle a concocted bet: which one of them can climb higher on a nearby mountain. As the moment approaches, Ashenden finds he is unable to commit cold-blooded murder, but the General has no such qualms and pushes the unsuspecting Caypor off a cliff.
However, a coded telegram informs them that Caypor is not their target. The General finds it very funny, but Elsa becomes terribly distraught when they are told. She decides to quit, despite having told Ashenden that she fell in love with him at first sight. In the lobby, she encounters Marvin. With no destination in mind, she persuades him to take her along with him. Meanwhile, the other two bribe a worker at a chocolate factory (the secret "German spy post office") to show them a very important message received the day before. They discover that it is addressed to none other than Marvin.
They set out in pursuit, taking the same train as Marvin and Elsa. Before they can arrange anything, they cross the border into Turkey – enemy territory – and a large number of soldiers board. Despite this, they manage to get Marvin alone in his compartment. Objecting to cold-blooded murder, Elsa draws a pistol. Before Ashenden can do anything, one way or the other, the train is attacked and derailed by airplanes sent by "R". Marvin is pinned in the wreckage, but manages to fatally shoot the General before dying. The "Ashendens" quit the spy business.','["Alfred Hitchcock"]','["Campbell Dixon","W.

As no rooms are available, Miss Steele talks her way into sharing a suite with Everard Logan, a handsome though somewhat stiff lawyer. All his efforts to oust her are to no avail and she even ends up talking him out of his pyjamas.
The next morning, they have breakfast together.  She tells him only her Christian name, Leslie; the night before she led him to believe she was married.  He insists they must meet again.  While he''s out of the room, dressing, she bolts, and is picked up by her family''s butler.
At home, where she lives with her grandfather, a judge, while her parents are India, Miss Steele queries him about Logan and tells her grandfather she''s going to marry him.  She also learns that Logan will be in her grandfather''s court that day.
At Logan''s office, an old school friend, Lord Mere, arrives and asks Logan to represent him in a divorce case against his wife, who had also been stranded at the hotel.  The story his friend tells of his wife matches what happened to Logan in every detail.  Logan defends Lady Mere, until he learns Lord Mere is her fourth husband, the previous three being very declasse.
Miss Steele attends her grandfather''s court that day to observe Logan in action and sees him rip a woman to shreds.  In his office he interviews the  Lady Mere''s maid, who saw Lady Mere and the man she was with, terrified she will recognize him.  Then Miss Steele shows up, and Logan rants at her about what he thinks is her past life; she plays along and he confesses to loving her, and they kiss.  He immediately panics and runs back into his office and insists on hearing all the details of Lady Mere''s marital career from her maid.  He agrees to take the case.
Logan meets Miss Steele at a nightclub and begs her to marry him once he obtains "her" divorce.  As they dance he queries her about her four husbands.  They leave the club and she makes an appointment to see him at his office.  At home, she tells her grandpa about the evening, and he tells her that her deception may backfire on her when Logan learns the truth.
Lord Mere shows up at Logan''s office and tells him the divorce is off.  Logan is disappointed, thinking his chance at love is gone.  Once Lord Mere gets home his wife tosses him out when he questions her story.  At his club, Lord Mere ponders Logan''s parting words, "Tell your wife she''s the most wonderfully clever woman in the world".  Drunk, he calls Logan at 3 am, insisting he explain the comment.
Logan tells Lord Mere that he''s "the man from the Royal Parks Hotel."  Lord Mere is amused, and gives his blessing.  At home, he also gives his blessing to his wife.
The next morning Miss Steele and Lady Mere arrive simultaneously at Logan''s office.  After they both simultaneously claim to be Lady Mere, Miss Steele drags Her Ladyship off to the beauty shop, where the learn the whole story from each other.  Lady Mere calls Logan, but it''s Miss Steele who invites him to Mere Hall.  After some doubts he accepts.
At Mere Hall, Logan arrives too late to ride out with the rest, but encounters Miss Steele and begs her to leave with him, but she rides off.  That afternoon at tea, he is introduced by Lady Mere to "Miss Leslie Steele" and turns away in disgust at her deception, while her grandpa laughs.
At the cost of abandoning an important case, he flees the country, but she manages to board the same ship, finds him, and insists, rather than eloping to Paris with her, he must return and argue the case, which he does, brilliantly.','["Tim Whelan"]','["Lajos Biró","Ian Dalrymple"]','["Merle Oberon","Laurence Olivier","Binnie Barnes"]','[""]','6.7','["tt0034274","tt0032943","tt0032179","tt0034272","tt0031831","tt0079477","tt0033021","tt0026942","tt0024436","tt0043660","tt0024473","tt0050861"]','["romance;comedy;pdmovies"]','[{"url":"/Lady_X_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/The_Divorce_of_Lady_X.mp4","format":"h.264 MPEG4"},{"url":"/The_Divorce_of_Lady_X_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','Lady_X',175351,'Q2142723','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Shelby attempts to flee, but is corned by more northern soldiers and she complies to meet with Major Barker.
At the Union headquarters, rogue Native American Chief Whitecloud (Chief Thundercloud) offers information of Jean''s sister Bob Shelby. Barker pays Whitecloud $10 to reveal Bob''s location in Fontana and tells his men to hang Whitecloud, should the information turn out to be false.  When a subordinate of Barker''s ask why they should trust Whitecloud, Barker reveals that Whitecloud has a goal of destroying the Shelby family. Sometime ago, Whitecloud tried to kidnap Jean''s mother, he was caught and the Cherokee kicked him out. Whitecloud has been a murderous renegade ever since, while still pursuing the Shelbys.
Later, Sergeant James (Edmund Cobb) brings Jean Shelby to Major Barker While Barker is distracted talking to Union Captain Raymond ( Alan Curtis ), Shelby pulls a gun on her guard. When Barker and Raymond come into the room to check on the commotion, she makes both men drop their guns. She then escapes out the window and flees on Raymond''s horse, leaving Barker furious and Raymond in awe. 
Jean rides to her parents’ house to warn them of Whitecloud''s impending arrival and to get her wounded brother Bob Shelby out of harm''s way.

Raymond convinces her to set up camp for the night and to let him stay. They begin to form a connection after Raymond reveals his first name and Shelby talks about the work she did during the war with her brother, and now that he is dead she doesn''t feel the need to be an outlaw like she once was. When Raymond asks why she is telling him all this, she replies by kissing him.
That same night Whitecloud surrounded by other outlaws boasts about killing Bob Shelby and rallies the outlaws to ride into the night with him to find Jean and cause whatever chaos they can.
In the morning Jean and Raymond hear Whitecloud and his men causing a commotion. He and his men have killed Jeans parents and set their house on fire.

Jerry wants Jean to join them and asks for her hand in marriage. Jean refuses calling him an outlaw. Jerry reveals she too is a wanted outlaw for helping Quantrail. After some hesitation, Jean accepts the offer to join Jerry and his men if they move to kill Whitecloud first.

Bob tells Jean that her offer to marry whichever outlaw kills Whitecloud is a bad idea and tensions are rising between the outlaws.  The outlaws reveal that they Whitecloud is headed for the country, but the Yankee Cavalry is on their way to intercept Whitecloud and Jean''s band of outlaws. Jerry calls off the deal and kills the remaining outlaws. Jean discovers from a dying Bob that Jerry did this so she sends him at gunpoint without any supplies. Jean then realizes she is alone and begins to sink into a depression saying “everything I touch dies.” While wandering through the woods, she slips on a hill and passes out under a tree, Union soldiers soon find her and take Jean prisoner.
At Union headquarters, Jean and Raymond reunite. Raymond reveals that he was taken as prisoner of war from Quantrail''s men and that Jerry made sure Raymond''s letters never made it Jean. Raymond decides that they will marry tomorrow and Jean gladly accepts stating her love for him. Jean tells Raymond she must leave to get a dress to be married in, but she actually leaves to confront Whitecloud alone. Raymond follows with a platoon in tow.
Whitecloud and his men are burning town to the ground and shooting everything in sight. Raymond sees the smoke and tells his men to fire.

Two fellow business men arrive at the counting house to collect a donation for the poor from Scrooge but the old man instead supports the prisons and workhouses and goes as far to say if the poor would rather die then they ''better do it and decrease the surplus population''. Scrooge catches Bob trying to take some coal but warns him he will be out of a job if he does not go back to work. Scrooge then refuses to dine with his only relative Fred his nephew and claims Christmas is ''Humbug!''.
That night after work Bob goes home to celebrate the holidays with his family while Scrooge dines alone at a seedy pub while the lords and ladies of London celebrate Christmas with the Lord Mayor of London. At his house Scrooge encounters the ghost of his seven-year dead partner Jacob Marley (Who is invisible in this version) who wears a chain he ''forged in life'' from his own wicked career. He tells Scrooge he will be haunted by three spirits in order to escape his fate.
That night as Marley warned Scrooge is haunted by the Ghost of Christmas Past (Marie Ney) who shows Scrooge when he lost his fiancée due to his greedy nature towards others including a debt-ridden couple. Scrooge then sees that his ex-fiancée is now married and has many children.
The next sprit the Ghost of Christmas Present (Oscar Asche) shows Scrooge just how poor Bob and his family are as they have a meager Christmas dinner of goose and pudding. The spirit threatens that unless the future changes Tiny Tim (Philip Frost) the youngest son who is ill will die. Scrooge then sees how others keep Christmas before seeing Fred celebrate with his wife and friends.
The Ghost of Christmas of yet to Come (C.V. France) shows Scrooge what lies in store the following year. Scrooge discovers Tim is dead and that the man that was robbed and spoken of by some businessmen was himself after seeing his grave.
Scrooge returns home a changed man and becomes a generous person. He orders a turkey for Bob and his family, gives a healthy donation to the two men from the day before and dines with Fred. The film then ends with Scrooge raising Bob''s wages and that he will be a stepfather to Tim before the two attend church together.','["Henry Edwards"]','["Charles Dickens","H.

The bane of Bart''s existence is the hated piano lessons he endures under the tutelage of the autocratic Dr. Terwilliker (Hans Conried). Bart feels that his mother has fallen under Terwilliker''s influence, and gripes to their plumber, August Zabladowski (Peter Lind Hayes), without result. While hammering at his lessons, Bart dozes off and enters a musical dream.
In the dream, Bart is trapped at the surreal Terwilliker Institute, where the piano teacher is a madman dictator who has imprisoned non-piano-playing musicians. He built a piano so large that it requires Bart and 499 other boys (hence, 5,000 fingers) to play it. Bart''s mother has become Terwilliker''s hypnotized assistant and bride-to-be, and Bart must dodge the Institute''s guards as he scrambles to save his mother and himself. He tries to recruit Mr. Zabladowski, who was hired to install the Institute''s lavatories ahead of a vital inspection, but only after skepticism and foot-dragging is Zabladowski convinced to help. The two construct a noise-sucking contraption which ruins the mega-piano''s opening concert. The enslaved boys run riot, and the "atomic" noise-sucker explodes in spectacular fashion, bringing Bart out from his dream.
The movie ends on a hopeful note for Bart, when Mr. Zabladowski notices Heloise and offers to drive her to town in his jeep. Bart escapes from the piano and runs down the street to play, with his dog Sport joyfully capering at his heels.','["Roy Rowland"]','["Dr. Seuss","Allan Scott"]','["Peter Lind Hayes","Mary Healy","Hans Conried"]','["Family","Fantasy","Music","Romance"]','6.8','["tt0059094","tt0052427","tt0063341","tt0044685","tt0296843","tt0015224","tt0058230","tt0033152","tt0046004","tt0041855","tt0068156","tt0045477"]','[""]','[{"url":"/5000_fingers_of_dr_t_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/5000_fingers_of_dr_t_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','5000_fingers_of_dr_t',28761,'Q1210771','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

En route, their car breaks down and they are reluctantly given accommodations in the home of Judge Malcolm Parker (Forrest Taylor).
The Judge, under indictment for bribery, has much to fear. His life, as well as that of his niece Louise (Inna Gest) has been threatened by a gang of racketeers; his companion, Giles (Dennis Moore), has accused him of embezzling Louise''s fortune; and his sinister housekeeper, Agnes, blames him for the death of her mistress, Leonora. The Judge''s fears are compounded when he meets Knuckles Dolan (Dave O''Brien), the boys'' guardian, whom he had unjustly sentenced to death, only to have his verdict reversed and Knuckles exonerated.
Later that night, when Louise is kidnapped and the Judge found strangled, Giles and Simp (Vince Barnett), the Judge''s bodyguard, accuse Knuckles of the murder, but the boys capture Simp and Giles and determine to find the murderer themselves. Muggs (Leo Gorcey) and Danny (Bobby Jordan) discover a secret panel in the library wall and enter a passage where they find Louise''s unconscious body and glimpse the figure of a fleeing man. Knuckles captures the man, who identifies himself as Jim Harrison (Alden ''Stephen'' Chase) of the district attorney''s office.
Amid the confusion, the real killer takes Louise captive, but the boys track him down and unmask Simp. Harrison then identifies the bodyguard as the triggerman seeking revenge on the Judge.

After being beaten and discarded one evening by her raging father, Lucy finds sanctuary in Cheng''s home, the beautiful and exotic room above his shop.

Gwen Rawlings was a teenage girl who continually fell into the wrong crowd. Gwen''s first troubles began with her employer who caught her "borrowing" a brooch from his pawnshop. Though Gwen had only borrowed it to use for a dance and had every intention of returning it, she was fired. When she arrived home and informed her father, he beat her. The next day Gwen packed her things and moved into a boarding house. There, she met Jimmy, a sharp-dressed man who immediately took a liking to her.
Jimmy found her a job at the Blue Angel Nightclub where she was employed as a hat-check girl. While working, she met Red, a bandmember for the club who felt the need to look after her well-being. Jimmy attempted to pursue Gwen but was rejected. He grew extremely angry towards the growing relationship between Red and Gwen and later beat her. Max Vine, his employer at the club, discovered Jimmy''s crime and fired him. Angry at Gwen, who he felt had lost him his job, Jimmy began to plot to set her up. He stole their landlady''s jewellery and told Gwen to pawn it for him. Believing that the jewelry belonged to his mother, Gwen followed his instructions. Later, after learning that Max had been attacked by a gang, Gwen implored Red to allow her to stay the night at his place. Red permitted her a night''s stay but insisted that she leave the following day as it was unsuitable for a young girl to live with him.
However, the police soon found Gwen and she was sent to court where she was accused of having stolen jewellery. Miss Thorpe presided over the hearing and decided to sentence her to a reform school for three years. During a school fight, Gwen runs away and finds Max who has opened another club. Max is reluctant to take her back but due to her desperation, he gives her a job. Gwen soon becomes close to Danny Martin, a regular at the club. One drunken night both are out for a drive when they accidentally hit and kill a police officer. Danny Martin forbids anyone from speaking to the police. However, once Danny is questioned, Gwen flees.
Danny later finds Gwen and beats her. Gwen is found and helped by two American soldiers who are AWOL. They decide to band together and become robbers in London. After becoming too well known in London for their crimes, they decide to head to Manchester. As they flag down a car to steal, Gwen realizes that the driver of the car is Red. When her companions realize the two recognize each other, they shoot Red dead. All three are eventually caught for their crimes and Gwen is currently serving fifteen years in prison.

Opening with a series of pans over palm leaves, we then gradually see people journey to Adam''s Peak, a center of Buddhist pilgrimage for over two hundred years. This is continually inter-cut with images of surrounding natural beauty and a series of pans of a Buddhist statue.
Part two focuses on the working life of the Sinhalese, again continually stressing their intimate connection to the surrounding environment. We see people engaging in pottery, woodcarving and the building of houses, whilst children play.
The third part of the film introduces the arrival of modern communications systems into the fabric of this ''natural'' lifestyle, heralded by experimental sounds and shots of industrial working practices.

He says that the Eskimos called the creature "bushman," the Colville Indians "Sasquatch," and the Hoopa "Om-mah," but is most commonly known as Bigfoot.
Marx''s brother-in-law takes him to the land of petrified wood, showing him rock carvings of creatures with big hands and feet. The carvings tell the story of the creature stealing children, causing a village to be abandoned.
Marx finds large tracks in the snow and later a dead bear with similar tracks nearby. He finds strange hair between the bear''s teeth and sets out to track the creature. He finds tracks in the mud beside a river and something moving nearby. He intends to inform others but rain washes the tracks away.
Marx investigates tracks in several states only to find they''re not bigfoot tracks. He visits the Oh-mah bigfoot redwood statue in northern California and the Oregon coast, continuing to search.
Marx takes a job in Washington state to film a Cinnamon bear. While there, he films Bigfoot walking through a field. He mentions that his footage of Bigfoot has been questioned by science and used by others on lecture circuits to make money.
Marx shows footage of an injured squirrel, goats eating dirt, and glaciers melting. He mentions the Trans-Alaska Pipeline and visits Yukon Frida, who paints pictures of Bigfoot.
Marx travels above the Arctic circle, showing footage of the Northern lights while relating Bigfoot tales. He visits an Eskimo who promises he''ll see Bigfoot. Later in the evening, he films what he describes "the shining eyes" of the creature, but when dawn comes, he says Bigfoot disappeared behind a rainbow.
Marx shows footage of salmon spawning, geese migrating, caribou, and Alaska moose defending their territory. He searches from a plane and films a young Bigfoot near a river. He lands, but Bigfoot runs away.
He films hunters with their kills and beavers gathering wood for their dams. He then shows footage of Bigfoot at another river and a second Bigfoot close by, mentioning a related strong musky odor. Bigfoot is shown eating grass and Marx mentions he must be a vegetarian.
Marx ends the film by saying he has determined Bigfoot''s migratory and eating habits and that he''ll continue his search to document more of Bigfoot''s behaviors.','["Harry Winer"]','["Harry Winer","Paula Labrot"]','["Ivan Marx","Peggy Marx","Yukon Frida"]','["Documentary"]','3.6','["tt0072895","tt0090094","tt0094274","tt0078203","tt0054240","tt0086013","tt0070119","tt1245112","tt0091561","tt0073762","tt5892486","tt0092795"]','["UFO; bigfoot; sasquatch; special edition; mothman; yeti; flying saucers; ivan marx; horror; documentary; science fiction; hoax; glowing eyes; fraud; legend"]','[{"url":"/IvanMarxsTheLegendOfBigfoot-SpecialEdition_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/TheMovie-desktop.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/TheMovie-desktop_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','IvanMarxsTheLegendOfBigfoot-SpecialEdition',17735,'Q7746692','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

He hires three gangster ex-convicts released from Alcatraz prison, Steve Maschick (Ward Bond), Hans "Dutch" Havermann (Warren Hymer) and Joe "The Book" Conway (Paul Fix).
The three join the Royal Canadian Air Force and hijack an aircraft flown by Johnny Stevens (Bruce Edwards) to enter German airspace. With Johnny joining them, the group pose as musicians to gain access to Hitler (Bobby Watson). With the help of Else von Brandt (Dorothy Tree), the gangsters capture and quickly cut his hair and shave off his moustache as SS soldiers try to break the door in.  When the SS manage to enter the room, they fail to recognize their leader and drag all the men, including Hitler, outside to be shot.
A desperate Hitler makes a break for it and is shot by the SS officer in charge, who states disdainfully and ironically: "To think that Germany could produce a piece of filth like you."

American secret agent XK150, using the alias Sparks Moran (Edward Wain or Robert Towne), has infiltrated the gang which consists of Capeto''s brazenly felonious blond girlfriend Mary-Belle Monahan (Betsy Jones-Moreland); her deceptively clean-cut younger brother Happy Jack (Robert Bean); and a gullible, good-natured, and homicidal oaf named Pete Peterson Jr. (Beach Dickerson), who constantly does animal impressions.
Unfortunately, despite his other role as the story''s omniscient narrator, Sparks is too much the Maxwell Smart-style bumbler to figure out what is going on because of his own incompetence and his hopeless infatuation with the completely uninterested Mary-Belle, who regards his attempts to rescue her from a life of crime with an amused contempt.
Capetto plans to steal the fortune in gold and then to claim that the mythical "Creature from the Haunted Sea" rose and devoured the loyalists, but it is he and his crew who murder the Cuban soldiers with sharpened, claw-like gardening tools and leave behind "footprints" made with a toilet plunger and a mixture of olive oil and green ink. However, he does not know that there really is a shaggy, pop-eyed sea monster lurking in the very waters that he plans to do the dirty deed and that the creature may make his plan all too easy to pull off.
When the monster''s insatiable hunger upsets his scheme, Capetto decides to sink his boat into 30 feet of water off the shore of a small island and then to retrieve the gold later. Complications ensue when the male members of his gang get romantically involved with the natives, with Pete hooking up with the aptly named Porcina (Esther Sandoval) and Jack with her pretty daughter Mango (Sonia Noemí González), and local working girl Carmelita (Blanquita Romero) takes an instant liking to Sparks.
Capetto and his gang go scuba diving to attempt to salvage the loot, but the creature picks them all off one by one except for Sparks and Carmelita, and the movie ends with its sitting on the undersea treasure and happily picking its teeth.','["Roger Corman"]',NULL,'["Antony Carbone","Betsy Jones-Moreland","Robert Towne"]','["Comedy","Horror"]','3.5','["tt0054017","tt0053611","tt0052655","tt0057569","tt0051993","tt0053610","tt0050748","tt0052846","tt0071675","tt0055304","tt0052188","tt0058379"]','["Horror;Crime;Comedy"]','[{"url":"/CreatureFromTheHauntedSea.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/CreatureFromTheHauntedSea_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/CreatureFromTheHauntedSea_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','CreatureFromTheHauntedSea',88286,'Q2133893','wp','["Charles B.

('tt0029019','free','Hoosier Schoolboy (1937)','1937','1h 2min','Mary Evans (Anne Nagel) moves to a small town in Indiana to take a teaching job in the local school. She checks in at the Noble Hotel when a young bellhop named Shockey Carter (Mickey Rooney) brings her suitcase upstairs to her room. When Shockey comes back downstairs, he encounters some classmates coming out of a dance. One of them, Roger Townsend, drops a quarter on the floor and tells Shockey to "Buy your old man another quart." Miss Evans, meanwhile, is shocked to find a drunk man (Frank Shields) in her hotel room, whom the hotel manager introduces as John ''Jack'' Matthews Jr., the dairy owner''s son.
The next morning, Shockey waits on the school grounds for Roger to arrive. When he does, he grabs Roger''s shirt and confronts him about what he said Saturday night at the hotel. With Roger not wanting to fight, Shockey punches him anyway and heads inside the school, late for Miss Evans'' first class. She recognizes Shockey from that night at the hotel. Roger arrives soon after and sits beside Shockey. In the middle of History class, Roger makes nasty remarks about Shockey''s background. When Roger''s remarks get worse, Shockey punches Roger again, starting a  classroom fight. Miss Evans breaks it up the fight and takes both boys to Principal Miss Hodges'' office to explain. Miss Hodges explains to Mary that while Roger comes from a fine family and could not be blamed for any coarse behavior (Shockey does not mention what Roger had said), Shockey is a "bad boy" and such behavior is expected from him.
After class, Miss Evans tries to find out from Shockey his side of the story, but the boy is reluctant to talk, accepting his lot in life. She gets him to take her to his house, across the train tracks into the woods. Shockey enters the house first to wake up his father (Edward Pawley) (whom he calls "Cap") and get him out of bed. Shockey invites Miss Evans in the house and shows her pictures of his father when he fought in the War to much acclaim for his bravery. Miss Evans and Captain Fred Carter talk about Shockey''s fight. Mary offers to help Shockey and his father clean their home. Though Shockey says the house will just get messy again, he accepts her help.
Later, Mis Evans and Shockey walk to school from his house on the day of a school board meeting about his behavior. At the meeting, Mr. Townsend says they should expel Shockey and send him to the state school of corrections. Shocked, Mary counters that he needs kindness and understanding. As the meeting continues, Shockey is outside leaning against a tree when classmate Elvira comes over. She asks if the school board is going to expel him, and he replies Miss Evans is speaking for him. Elvira teases Shockey, calling him Miss Evans'' "pet". Very offended, Shockey knocks Elvira''s school books out of her hands. When she says that a gentleman would pick up the books and apologize, Shockey does, and Elvira thanks him. "I think you''re the strongest boy in the class," she says. "Think so?", Shockey asks, "how would you like me to take a whack at some guy for you?" Mary comes out and announces that Shockey won''t be expelled. As Mary walks off, Shockey tries to ask Elvira out on a date, but had a hard time putting the words together because he is so in love with her.
A big benefit party takes place at the school, with food sold in combination boxes. Again Roger teases Shockey about his father. Just as Shockey is about to punch Roger again, Elvira restrains his fist. Shockey comes up with a slightly less violent way to react to Roger, grabbing a handful of ice cubes by a punch bowl and stuffing it down the back of his shirt.
In a dare by Elvira insinuating that he doesn''t know how to dance, Shockey suddenly starts tap-dancing and turns to the applause of the crowd, clamoring for another round, one of whom is Miss Hodges who acknowledges that he might''ve been too hard on the boy.  Shockey''s dancing is interrupted by Captain Carter''s barging in uninvited and drunk, shattering some cups and making everyone uncomfortable. He is escorted out by Jack, followed by Miss Evans and Shockey.
Back to the Cap''s house, Jack, in an effort to help curtail the Captain''s drinking habit, gives Shockey''s father a job under his father''s company as a driver. Because of the rising tensions between townsfolk and Mr. Matthews Sr, the Captain crashes his delivery truck in a re-enactment of his shell-shocked memories of the war, resulting in his death. The Captain''s death solved the tension, and Shockey observes that the Cap died a hero after all. Shockey is offered a room by Mr. Matthews Sr. and the final shot consists of him, Shockey, Miss Evans, and Jack riding off in a car.','["William Nigh"]',NULL,'["Mickey Rooney","Anne Nagel","Frank Shields"]','[""]','5.6','["tt0034711","tt0027993","tt0025488","tt0030997","tt0040478","tt0047178","tt0030786","tt0030386","tt0030253","tt0028634","tt0035218","tt0041907"]','[""]','[{"url":"/hoosier_schoolboy.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/hoosier_schoolboy_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/hoosier_schoolboy_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','hoosier_schoolboy',18461,'Q5898613','wp','["Robert Lee Johnson"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Each of the outlaws bears a characteristic that Bill memorized while watching his family slaughtered and his house set on fire: the first has a tattoo of four aces on his chest, the second a scar, the third one a distinctive earring and the fourth (who was the one who saved young Bill from the burning house) wears a necklace bearing a skull; while he saw the face of the fifth, he never saw the face of the man of who saved him from the fire.
As he begins his journey, a gunfighter named Ryan (Lee Van Cleef) is released from a prison after serving 15 years there. He was framed for an armed robbery by the very same men who murdered Bill''s family. When they meet along the way, Ryan gets the better of Bill, who is blinded by vengeance, but he does Bill no harm. In the next town, Ryan asks for a man named Cavanaugh (Anthony Dawson), whom Bill recognized later as the man with four aces tattoo. Bill manages to kill Cavanaugh in a duel, but the more experienced Ryan insists on tracking the other outlaws alone. They cross paths again in Lyndon City, where Ryan meets rich banker named Walcott (Luigi Pistilli) and demands his share of the robbery 15 years ago. Walcott stages a robbery on his bank and frames Ryan. When the tables are turned later, Bill reciprocates, helping Ryan escape from a jail. An equally determined Bill sets out ahead of him.
Bill reaches a Mexican town, where he recognizes the man with the big earring and guns him down. He is captured by the outlaws, beaten and buried alive from the neck down (He had also recognized the man with the scar and Walcott). Left to die in the hot sun, he is rescued by Ryan, who shoots several men standing guard. Preparing for the gang''s return, Bill notices that Ryan is wearing a necklace with a skull. Ryan admits he was present during the murders. He gives his word that once the outlaws have been dealt with, he will remain to face whatever justice Bill seeks.
In a final shootout during a sand storm, the last remaining man who killed Bill''s family has him dead to rights, only to be killed by Ryan''s thrown knife. Bill nonetheless insists on revenge. Ryan''s gun is empty, so Bill tosses a bullet to him. He has just one bullet left now himself. Ryan turns his back and walks away, daring Bill to shoot him in the back. Bill fires, but it is only to kill a surviving outlaw. A grateful Ryan then watches as Meceita mounts his horse and rides away.','["Giulio Petroni"]',NULL,'["Lee Van Cleef","John Phillip Law","Mario Brega"]','["Western"]','7.1','["tt0061709","tt0063501","tt0064916","tt0063293","tt0066612","tt0061587","tt0061429","tt0068657","tt0060315","tt0063032","tt0074740","tt0061636"]','["Westren; Public Domain; Lee Van Cleef;pdmovies"]','[{"url":"/DeathRidesAHorse1967.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/DeathRidesAHorse1967_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/DeathRidesAHorse_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','DeathRidesAHorse',55506,'Q1517207','wp','["Luciano Vincenzoni"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Getting inspiration from a dog digging a hole in the sand, Fatty ditches his wife by burying himself in the sand then making a run for the amusement park as she searches for him. Fatty''s wife enlists the help of an old friend (Al St. John, referred to as "Old Friend") who enters the park to look for Fatty, however once inside he notices an attractive young lady (Alice Mann, referred to as "Pretty Girl") who is there on a date with a young man (Buster Keaton, referred to as "Rival") and promptly woos her into entering the park with him rather than Rival, leaving the latter distraught.
Finding he has no money, Rival gains entry to the park by hiding in a barrel and follows Pretty Girl and Old Friend around the park. Once inside, Rival and Old Friend both attempt to impress Pretty Girl, Rival by trying to win on the high striker and Old Friend by buying her ice cream but Pretty Girl is ultimately unimpressed by both men''s childish behavior
Fatty shows up on the scene and is likewise smitten with Pretty Girl and begins making polite conversation with her. When Old Friend returns with the ice cream, Fatty pretends he got them for her in order to impress her which it does. Old Friend furiously threatens Fatty, but Fatty kicks a nearby policemen in the rear and makes him think Old Friend did it leading to the latter being arrested.
Fatty and Pretty Girl next go for a ride on the log flumes but the force of the impact upon hitting the water sends both flying into the surrounding pool. Rival saves Pretty Girl and Fatty but is immediately knocked accidentally into the pool by Fatty who, seeing that Rival can swim and will not drown, once again walks off with Pretty Girl. Spotting his wife looking for him, Fatty takes Pretty Girl into a nearby boathouse and the two dress up (Fatty as a woman and Pretty Girl in a new dress and a long wig) to avoid detection before heading to the beach.
Arbuckle''s wife has heard that Old Friend has been arrested and bails him out of jail and the two go to the beach to come up with a new plan where they bump into Fatty and Pretty Girl in their disguises. Old Friend finds himself attracted to Fatty dressed up as a woman and flirts with him before Rival arrives on the scene and reveals that the woman is in fact Fatty. Furious, Old Friend chases Fatty to the sea where they begin to fight. Pretty Girl, realizing that Old Friend is a sleazy womanizer and Fatty has a wife, decides to return to Rival and the two run off down the beach together. Fatty''s wife calls the police to break up the fight and three police officers (The Keystone Cops) arrive at the beach to arrest both men. They are taken to jail but before they can be locked up they overpower all of the cops and throw them in the jail cell. Before Fatty can leave he receives a furious dressing down from his wife until he can take no more and throws her in the jail cell as well.
In the film''s closing moments Fatty and Old Friend stand on the police steps and agree that the pursuit of women was the reason for all of their misfortune today and both swear off women for good. However, just after making this pact two attractive women walk past them and the two gleefully give chase.','["Roscoe ''Fatty'' Arbuckle"]',NULL,'["Roscoe ''Fatty'' Arbuckle","Buster Keaton","Joe Bordeaux"]','[""]','6.3','["tt0008874","tt0009466","tt0008112","tt0007761","tt0008377","tt0009123","tt0008523","tt0009899","tt0008975","tt0010155","tt0010221","tt0009389"]','["New York; sulent; comedy"]','[{"url":"/ConeyIsland.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/ConeyIsland_17_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/ConeyIsland_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','ConeyIsland_17',8330,'Q3067296','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Andy (Mickey Rooney) has received an honorable discharge from the Army after a service of two years. His parents are unaware of the fact that Andy is looking to get back with his college sweetheart Kay (Bonita Granville). One day soon after Andy''s homecoming, his mother Emily observes him looking at store window displays of wedding rings and baby clothing, and suspects that her son must be in love. Emily''s suspicions are soon confirmed when Andy, who usually has had an eye for girls, barely notices the very attractive singer, Isobel Gonzales (Lina Romay), when they are introduced.
Isabel is a regular singer at the Carvel country club, and when Andy comes there and they are introduced to each other, she falls in love with him. Andy, however, isn''t smitten by Isabel in the same way, still preoccupied with thinking about his college sweetheart. Andy wants to return to Wainwright college to finish his studies and meet his sweetheart as soon as possible. Andy is very determined though, to keep the romance a secret form his parents. When Andy is with his parents visiting the country club, he finds out there is a telegram, sent by Kay, that is supposed to be delivered to him at his parents house. He panics, and in a desperate attempt to hide it from his parents, he makes up an excuse to leave the club to help out a friend. He convinces a friend to cover for him and spread a fake story about a broken water faucet. But in reality he rushes home to the house and intercepts the telegram before anyone else get to see it.
A series of unfortunate events take place from this moment on. Andy is about to take a shower at the house when he realises that the water is switched off. He goes outside in his robe to switch it on, when the front door shuts behind him and locks automatically. Andy is stranded outside in the garden, and has to wait in the shrubbery until his parents arrive home from the country club. Before he has a chance to get inside the house again, a passing police man discovers him hiding in the bushes. The police man doesn''t believe Andy''s story when he tries to explain his business in the garden, and insists on taking him inside to get a confirmation from his parents.
Emily is upset with her son''s recent erratic behaviour and blames the fact that he is blinded by love. She forces her husband to talk with his son and straighten him out on the subject of choosing the right kind of woman. Andy confesses his plan to ask Kay to marry him when he comes back to college. His parents don''t approve of this plan and decide to follow him to Wainwright - to keep an eye on him and keep him away from his sweetheart.
The president of the school council, Duke Johnson (Hal Hackett), offers Andy the honor of being chairman of the freshman dance as soon as he gets back to the college. Andy accepts the offer, but finds out soon after that Kay cannot attend the dance. Because of a family emergency she is required to go home to her legal guardian, Dane Kittridge (Dick Simmons). Duke understands that Andy is in need of a date at the dance, so he sets up with a girl named Coffy Smith (Dorothy Ford), who is a great deal taller than Andy, making him look ridiculous beside her.
Andy is quite embarrassed by their appearance together, but soon warms up to the bigger girl and they become good friends. Andy is shocked however, when Kay comes back to Wainwright and tells him that she has fallen in love with her guardian Dane, and that she is planning on marrying him the very next day. Andy is heartbroken, but as a sign of good faith he nevertheless agrees to be Kay''s best man at the wedding. When the wedding is over Andy makes plans to go to South America and forget his sorrows, but his father talks to him and convinces him to go back to Wainwright and complete his degree.','["Willis Goldbeck"]','["Harry Ruskin","William Ludwig"]','["Mickey Rooney","Lewis Stone","Sara Haden"]','[""]','5.8','["tt0036602","tt0033832","tt0031043","tt0030386","tt0051360","tt0030997","tt0030295","tt0030535","tt0031403","tt0034618","tt0033342","tt0029942"]','["Drama; Comedy; Romance; Mickey Rooney"]','[{"url":"/LOVE_LAUGHS_AT_ANDY_HARDY.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/LOVE_LAUGHS_AT_ANDY_HARDY_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/andy_hardy_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','andy_hardy',23120,'Q6690920','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Confronted with an ultimatum if he wants to keep his job, Larry is assigned to cover a big harvest festival held at a winery in Grape City.
Larry begins with getting off the bus at the wrong stop, Grape Center instead of Grape City. He has brought along his girlfriend Sally Warren (Ann Savage), who deals in antiques. Accidents rarely come alone, and the man sitting next to Larry on the bus is found murdered, holding a chess piece in his hand when the police find him. Of course Larry, who is a chess expert, is blamed for the killing.
All the bus passengers are held in custody at Grape Center awaiting the sheriff to start the murder investigation. Before he arrives, Sally finds an set of antique chess pieces she wants to acquire, and involves Larry in her quest to buy them. The set is said to have been the property of Kublai Khan in the 13th century, and brought to the West by Marco Polo. Unfortunately, the set is divided between Charles and Preston Waldeck (Lucien Littlefield), twins owning the winery, who have not spoken to each other in 10 years.
Sally manages to acquire the white set pieces from Preston. When Larry is about to get the black pieces from Charles, both he and Charles are knocked out by an unknown attacker, who also steals the black set pieces.
The sheriff arrives, and starts conducting his investigation. The prime suspect is convicted murderer Deacon Markham (Barton MacLane), who first sold the antique chess set to the Waldeck brothers, after stealing it from its rightful owner. The theory is that Markham now wants the set back to sell it back to the first owner and get the money he needs to escape the country.
Markham reveals himself when holding Larry at gunpoint in his hotel room to get the white pieces from the set. Markham and his accomplice Mink (George E. Stone) hide when Sally enters the room, telling Larry she hid the pieces in his room. Soon after, another guest, Flo Rosson (Veda Ann Borg), also enters the room and reveals that she is an insurance agent tracking Markham''s gang to retrieve the chess set. She also reveals that the man killed on the bus was part of this gang of thieves.
Also at the inn is Preston''s grandson, Oliver Waldeck (Buddy Swan), a precocious boy genius, and his mentor, Professor Wisner (Robert Emmett Keane). Oliver frightens Larry with scary antics, including a pronouncement that the corpse''s head was chopped off, placing a cabbage adorned by a toupee in Larry''s room. Oliver throws a smoke bomb into the room, and everyone is forced out into the corridor. In the ensuing commotion, the white pieces are stolen.
Snooping about the winery, Larry manages to find the black set, but is knocked unconscious in the wine cellar. When she finds the other part of the set, Sally is also knocked out by Oliver''s tutor, Professor Wisner. Larry wakes up, unties himself and goes after the killer, who turns out to be Professor Wisner, and ultimately finds the dead body.
After Sally has found the complete set, the insurance adjuster Flo offers her a $1,000 reward for retrieving it. Larry phones his editor, explaining the events at Grape Center and how he caught the murderer. He then asks his editor if he should continue to the festival at Grape City or come back and get fired.','["Frank McDonald"]','["Daniel Mainwaring","Maxwell Shane"]','["Jack Haley","Ann Savage","Barton MacLane"]','["Mystery","Comedy"]','4.9','["tt0046280","tt0091898","tt0037151","tt0037960","tt0038110","tt0037518","tt0038877","tt0037893","tt0043920","tt0032520","tt0037419","tt0037777"]','["comedy;crime;Jack Haley"]','[{"url":"/ScaredStiff.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/ScaredStiff_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/Scared_Stiff_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','Scared_Stiff',11770,'Q7430369','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Just when Amy is about to land at the docks in New York City, a man named John Grey - a New York architect living in Rochester - gets a telegram informing him of the arrival of his wife and children by boat. This John Grey (Franchot Tone is shocked, since he is about to marry the socialité daughter, Lois (Frances Rafferty, of his boss Mr. Evans (Clarence Kolb) of his architectural firm that same weekend. Thinking it may by chance be a man with the same name Johnny contacts all the "John Grey"s of Rochester to find out that none were married in England.
It is true that he spent some time in England during the war, and he may have met some woman, but he lacks every memory of Tillie and her two twin children because he was suffering from amnesia. He confesses to his friend Dr. Bob Davis (Tom Conway) that he may have married a woman in London. Just prior to his airborne division being sent to fight in Continental Europe he was on leave in London during a bombing raid where he hit his head on a lamp post.  He lost his memory for a total of six weeks and was recorded as missing in action. Eventually the US Military found him and he was cured of his amnesia and brought home across the Atlantic. What exactly happened during those six weeks is a blur, but everyone in America who knew John thought he was wounded in battle.
Johnny has a big bachelor party planned for the same night, and cannot meet Amy by the boat at her arrival. Amy starts a pointless search for a "John Grey from Rochester" and finds nothing. She decides to go to Rochester and continue her search. By accident she happens to check in at the same hotel as the one where the bachelor party takes place, and Johnny resides. By mistake, and because Amy is looking for John Grey, she and the twins are taken for a hired act to perform at the bachelor party dinner. Johnny''s friends jokingly present Amy, Joyce and Johnny Jr. in front of everyone at the party as his "wife and kids", and Johnny is humiliated.
Amy is still posing as Johnny''s wife Tillie, when she confronts Johnny right there at the party on his responsibilities as a husband and father. Johnny has no chance of recognizing Amy, since they never met, and he denies being married to her; still believing that she in fact is Tillie - his English wife. Panicked by the incident Johnny has quite a few drinks with his best friend Bob who tries to get Johnny to relive his stormy crossing to the United Kingdom and his commando training in an effort to get him to recall what occurred during his amnesia but they are unsuccessful. They wander the streets, afraid of going back to face Amy/Tillie, who has camped in the hotel lobby, waiting for him to show his face. Because of his intoxication Johnny gets into a quarrel with a police officer in the street. Due to the lack of other options he eventually decides to lose his memory and get "amnesia" again. He deliberately runs into another lamppost and knocks himself out.
Later in the night Amy is informed that her "husband" is down at the Rochester police station waiting for her. She goes over there to pick him up, but he is going on and on about his amnesia. A nearby news reporter overhears their conversation and finds out that Amy is a "war bride", which, considering that Johnny is about to marry a socialité that weekend, is big news. The next morning it is all over the news that John is already married to an English woman. Subsequently, the engagement to his bosses daughter is broken off and he immediately loses his job at the architectural firm. Johnny decides to do his duty and devote himself to take care of his children; he finds himself pretty well in the role as a father and is beginning to enjoy himself. Meeting Amy/Tillie on a regular basis he gets more and more attracted to her - his "wife". Amy pretends to remember with fondness their six-week romance all those years ago, but problems arise when Johnny wants to get closer and demand his conjugal rights. Amy tries to get away by saying that he should fall in love again, since it was such a long time ago they met.
Johnny is frustrated by this and seeks his best friend Bob''s advice on the matter. Bob has also grown fond of Amy/Tillie and is attracted to her in the same way Johnny is. Bob''s deceitful advice is for Johnny to back off, since Amy/Tillie may not be attracted to this "new" Johnny at all. Another problem is arising when Amy learns that the Red Cross has found out about her fake identity and threatens have her deported as an illegal immigrant using false documents. The Red Cross also claim that Johnny cannot be burdened with the responsibility of the twins, since there is no hard evidence that he really is their father. Amy feels forced to tell Johnny and Bob the truth about her deceit. The same day as she gets the notice from the Red Cross, she also gets two photographs from the housekeeper Mrs. Tubbs in England, showing Tillie and Johnny, in love, back during the war, when he had his amnesia. There is also a photo showing Tillie with the twins.
The photograph is proof enough that Johnny is the twins'' father and secures their future with him in America. Amy, however, still risks being deported as an illegal alien with fraudulent documents, since the photographs prove that she in fact isn''t who she has claimed to be. When word of her deceit spreads, Johnny''s engagement to his bosses daughter Lois is again feasible. Johnny''s job is also back at hand. Johnny agrees to marry Lois the next day.
During the night, however, John does a lot of thinking and concludes that he is in love with Amy, not Tillie, and he doesn''t want Bob to pursue her. He decides to pretend having another amnesia episode and get Lois to call off the wedding because he doesn''t remember that he loves her. After meeting with Lois he rushes off to meet with Amy. In his hurry he loses control of the car and crashes it right into the hotel where Amy stays. Johnny is injured and ends up in a hospital. Amy visits him and he proposes to her from his sick-bed. Lois arrives and faints when she sees Johnny with Amy and the twins.','["Leigh Jason"]',NULL,'["Franchot Tone","Ann Richards","Tom Conway"]','[""]','5.6','["tt0037530","tt0037636","tt0040457","tt0034055","tt0031298","tt0044420","tt0038156","tt0030387","tt0034285","tt0034179","tt0038346","tt0024554"]','["Comedy; Romance"]','[{"url":"/LostHoneymoon.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/LostHoneymoon_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/LostHoneymoon_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','LostHoneymoon',35541,'Q6684059','wp','["Joseph Fields"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Few clues exist as to what caused his death, aside from several drops of liquid found that resembled chloroform. Rumors of a love triangle between Woodford and two cast members circulate as a possible motive for his death.
Five years after the theater''s closure, producer Mike Brody decides to solve the mystery by again staging the play with the remaining cast and re-enacting Woodford''s murder. During rehearsals in the abandoned theater, strange occurrences plague the cast, including ominous noises, falling scenery, and an unexplained fire. Doris, the lead actress, has her purse stolen from her dressing room by an unseen assailant; Josiah Bunce, the stage manager, reportedly receives a telegram warning him to drop out of the play, signed by John Woodford, and the theater''s new owner, Arthur McHugh, also receives a visit from Woodford''s ghost. 
The production continues, and during the final rehearsal, Harvey Carleton inexplicably disappears from the stage during a blackout. Doris spots a mysterious masked figure in a theater box in addition to a man resembling John Woodford, but both disappear. Behind a picture hanging on the stage, a lever is discovered which opens a trap door, where the cast find Harvey incoherent. Arthur and Richard Quayle, another cast member, venture inside, where they discover a tunnel that leads to Doris''s dressing room. 
Arthur has police officers appointed at the theater for the show''s opening the following night. During the performance, an electrical wire charged to 400 volts is discovered connected to a candlestick onstage, and Arthur lunges at Richard to prevent him from touching it during the final scene. The unseen masked assailant is discovered hiding inside a grandfather clock onstage, but he drops through a trap door in the floor just after shooting one of the police officers. The assailant scales the theater and throws a dummy resembling John Woodford onto the stage. He then begins swinging from a rope, but is brought back down by a stagehand who cuts it.
The masked assailant is discovered to be Josiah, who caused Woodford''s death via electrocution and had been behind the "hauntings" to prevent the theater from being used.','["Paul Leni"]','["Wadsworth Camp","Alfred A.

The story begins on a train at night where an elegantly dressed woman (Gail Patrick) meets a mysterious foreigner (Fritz Leiber, Sr.).  She is fascinated when he is able to predict every shake and bump of the train, and every flickering moment of darkness, an instant before they occur, though he claims he has never ridden on this train before.  He is, evidently, gifted with some sort of second sight.  He offers to tell her a story about events that began at some unspecified time at the next station.  The point of view then shifts to acting out this narrative, which starts with Harold Dunlap (Charles Russell) inadvertently killing a woman with whom he has had a violent fight on the platform.  He places her body on the open rear end of a departing train and then goes in search of a boarding house where he can hide out for a time.  There he encounters a young woman named Jean Maxwell (Mary Beth Hughes) with whom he appears to fall in love and the young boy who recognizes him.  
After the film returns to the present it is revealed that Dr Valonius has an immediate and compelling interest in telling the story and the moral it teaches.  We are left to speculate that he may in the future choose other passengers to whom he will tell weird stories which have been revealed to him via his psychic powers, somewhat in the manner of the eponymous narrator in the radio series The Mysterious Traveler.','["Lew Landers"]',NULL,'["Charles Russell","Mary Beth Hughes","Dale Belding"]','["Film-Noir","Horror","Mystery","Thriller"]','6.0','["tt0039730","tt0041187","tt0038346","tt0039372","tt0049621","tt0036886","tt0047178","tt0040153","tt0041523","tt0039820","tt0038986","tt0042707"]',NULL,'[{"url":"/inner_sanctum.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/inner_sanctum_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/inner_sanctum_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','inner_sanctum',104991,'Q6035554','wp','["Jerome T.

While playing baseball in the street, the Kids accidentally send a ball crashing through the window of the apartment in which Butch and Mike are hiding. Butch emerges and refuses to give the ball back, so Danny (Bobby Jordan) runs after him. When Joe recognizes Butch, he chases him and Danny trips the criminal, who is then arrested along with Mike. Danny is awarded $200 for capturing the criminals and plans to buy baseball uniforms for his friends. They are unaware of his plans, however, and, thinking he is keeping the money to be selfish, steal it from him and ban him from the club.
Danny''s sister Ruth (Gale Storm) calls Joe, who is her boyfriend, and he has the Kids arrested for thievery. The arrest deepens the Kids''s resentment of Danny, even though Danny insists that they be released. Once free, the Kids buy an old car with the $200. A month later, Hank breaks out of jail with Butch and Mike and warns Mugs (Leo Gorcey), the leader of the Eastside Kids, and the rest of the group that the gangsters are after Danny for getting them arrested.
The gang responds immediately out of deeply rooted loyalty for their friend, but are too late and find him severely beaten in a warehouse, where Butch and Mike have left him.

In the Middle Ages a plague of slavery descended on the world. From the wilds of Mongolia rode a mighty army of fierce horsemen, led by Genghis Khan. Burning, looting, pillaging ... the barbarian horde swept across Asia and Eastern Europe. Genghis Khan conquered most of the world of the thirteenth century. Adolf Hitler was determined to outdo him, and conquer all the world of the twentieth century.Set up at Munich was an institute devoted to the little-known science of geopolitics, vaguely defined as "the military control of space". Germany''s leading geopolitician, a former general, Karl Haushofer, was head man. Here has gathered together more information about your home town than you yourself know.To the German geopolitician, the world is not made up of men and women and children, who live and love and dream of better things. It is made up of only two elements – labor and raw materials. The geopoliticians'' job was to transform Hitler''s ambition to control these elements into cold, hard reality.On their map our planet is neatly divided into land and water. Water forms three quarters of the earth''s surface, land only one quarter. And in that one quarter of the earth''s surface lies the world''s wealth, all its natural resources - and the world''s manpower.Control the land and you control the world - that was Hitler''s theory. This all-important "land" the geopoliticians now break up into two areas - one the Western Hemisphere which together with Australia and all the islands of the world including Japan, comprises one third of the total land area. The other area, which consists of Europe, Asia and Africa, makes up the other two thirds. This supercontinent, which they call the "World Island", is not only twice as large as the rest of the land area, but also includes seven-eighths of the world''s population.The heart of this "World Island" comprises Eastern Europe and most of Asia. This they call the "Heartland", which just about coincides with the old empire of Genghis Khan.Hitler''s step-by-step plan for world conquest can be summarized this way:Conquer Eastern Europe and you dominate the Heartland.
Conquer the Heartland and you dominate the World Island.

('tt0042369','free','D.O.A. (1949)','1949','1h 23min','The film begins with what a BBC reviewer called "perhaps one of cinema''s most innovative opening sequences." The scene is a long, behind-the-back tracking sequence featuring Frank Bigelow (Edmond O''Brien) walking through the hallway of a police station to report his own murder. Oddly, the police have been expecting him and already know who he is.
A flashback begins with Bigelow in his hometown of Banning, California, where he is an accountant and notary public. He decides to take a one-week vacation in San Francisco, but this does not sit well with Paula Gibson (Pamela Britton), his confidential secretary and girlfriend, as he does not want her to accompany him.
Bigelow accompanies a group from a sales convention on a night on the town. At a "jive" nightclub called "The Fisherman," unnoticed by Bigelow, a stranger swaps his drink for another. The nightclub scene includes one of the earliest depictions of the Beat subculture. The next morning, Bigelow feels ill. He visits a doctor''s office, where tests reveal he swallowed a "luminous toxin" for which there is no antidote. A second opinion confirms the grim diagnosis, and the other doctor implies that the poisoning must have been deliberate. Bigelow remembers his drink tasted strange.
With a few days to live at most, Bigelow sets out to untangle the events behind his impending death, interrupted occasionally by phone calls from Paula. She provides the first clue: a man named Eugene Phillips, who had been urgently trying to contact Bigelow for the last few days, had suddenly died. Bigelow travels to Phillips'' import-export company in Los Angeles, first meeting Miss Foster (Beverly Garland) (whose on-screen credit reads "Beverly Campbell"), the secretary, and then Mr. Halliday (William Ching), the company''s comptroller, who tells him Eugene Phillips committed suicide by jumping from his office a day earlier. From there, the trail leads to Phillips'' widow (Lynn Baggett) and brother Stanley (Henry Hart).
The key to the mystery is a bill of sale for what turns out to be stolen iridium. Bigelow had notarized the document for Eugene Phillips six months earlier on behalf of Phillips'' business associate George Reynolds. He connects Phillips'' mistress, Marla Rakubian (Laurette Luez), to gangsters led by Majak (Luther Adler). They capture Bigelow and take him to Majak, where he learns that Reynolds, actually Majak''s nephew, Raymond Rakubian, died months earlier, after the sale. Since Bigelow has learned too much, Majak orders his psychopathic henchman Chester (Neville Brand) to kill him. However, Bigelow manages to escape and Chester is killed by the police while attempting to kill Bigelow.
Bigelow thinks Stanley and Miss Foster are his killers, but when he confronts them he finds Stanley has been poisoned too—after having dinner with Mrs. Phillips. He directs them to call an ambulance and tells them what poison has been ingested so that, in Stanley''s case at least, prompt treatment may save his life. Stanley tells Bigelow he found evidence that Halliday and Mrs. Phillips were having an affair. Bigelow realizes that the theft was merely a diversion. Eugene discovered the affair and Halliday killed him.
Halliday and Mrs. Phillips used the investigation of the iridium as a cover for their crime, making it seem that Eugene Phillips had killed himself out of shame. However, when they discovered that there was evidence of his innocence in the notarized bill of sale, Halliday murdered anyone who had knowledge of the bill of sale. Bigelow tracks Halliday down and shoots him to death in an exchange of gunfire.
The flashback comes to an end. Bigelow finishes telling his story at the police station and dies, his last word being "Paula."

Among his many henchmen are: Spoerri, his cocaine-addicted manservant; Georg, his chauffeur and sometime assassin; Pesch, an inept goon; Hawasch, who employs a gang of blind men in a counterfeiting operation; Fine, a woman who serves as a lookout; and Folies Bergère dancer Cara Carozza, who loves him.
As the film opens, Mabuse orchestrates the theft of a commercial contract in order to create a temporary panic in the stock market, which he exploits to make huge profits.
Edgar Hull, the son of a millionaire industrialist, becomes Mabuse''s next victim. As "Hugo Balling", Mabuse gains access to Hull''s gentlemen''s club and wins a small fortune at cards from the hypnotized Hull, who is made to play badly and recklessly. Afterwards, Hull is unable to account for his behavior.
State prosecutor Norbert von Wenk takes an interest in Hull, believing he is the latest in a string of victims similarly tricked by the elusive "Great Unknown". Von Wenk goes undercover at a gambling den, where he encounters a disguised Dr. Mabuse. Mabuse attempts to hypnotize von Wenk, but he effectively resists. Mabuse flees. Von Wenk, quickly regaining his faculties, gives chase through the city, but the doctor escapes. Boarding a taxicab driven by Georg, von Wenk is gassed, robbed, and set adrift in a rowboat.
Dr. Mabuse realizes that Hull is assisting the state prosecutor, and resolves to eliminate both men. Carozza, who has been romancing Hull on Mabuse''s orders, lures the young man to a new illegal casino; when von Wenk calls in the police to raid the place, Carozza, Hull and a police bodyguard exit through the back door, where Georg awaits. He kills Hull, but Carozza is caught and jailed. Von Wenk questions her for information about the "Great Unknown", but she refuses to speak. Von Wenk enlists the aid of Countess Told (nicknamed the "Passive Lady"), an aristocrat bored by her dull husband and seeking thrills wherever she can find them, to try to get the information by trickery. The Countess is placed in the same cell, an apparent victim of another raid, but Carozza is not fooled. Carozza reveals only her great love for Mabuse, ensuring her silence. The Countess, moved by Carozza''s passion, tells von Wenk that she cannot continue to assist him.
Dr. Mabuse does nothing to extricate Carozza from jail. He instead attends a séance where he meets Countess Told, who (while under his hypnotic influence) invites him to her house. Once there, Mabuse, taken by the Countess''s beauty, decides to display his power by telepathically inducing her husband, Count Told, to cheat at poker. His guests are outraged when they detect it, and the Countess faints. Dr. Mabuse uses the distraction to abduct her and imprison her in his lair.
Part II — Inferno: A Game for the People of our Age (Part II – Inferno: Ein Spiel von Menschen unserer Zeit)
A sick and disgraced Count Told seeks the help of Dr. Mabuse to treat his depression; Mabuse uses this chance to isolate the Count in his manor and cut off any inquiries about the Countess''s whereabouts. The Count''s condition worsens, and he is tormented by hallucinations.
Meanwhile, Carozza is moved to a women''s prison and again interrogated by von Wenk. Fearing betrayal, Mabuse sanctions Carozza''s death. Georg smuggles poison to her cell, which she takes out of loyalty. Another of Mabuse''s henchmen, Pesch, bombs von Wenk''s office while posing as an electrician, but von Wenk is unharmed and Pesch detained. Mabuse – again fearing betrayal – arranges for Pesch to be killed by a sniper while being transported in a police wagon.
Intent on leaving town, Mabuse gives the captive Countess the choice of going with him voluntarily. Her refusal angers him, and Mabuse vows that he will kill the Count. Through his powers of suggestion, he induces the Count to commit suicide with a razor blade. When von Wenk investigates his death, he questions Dr. Mabuse as the Count''s psychoanalyst. Dr. Mabuse speculates that the Count had fallen under the control of a hostile will, and asks von Wenk if he is familiar with the experiments of one "Sandor Weltemann", who will be performing a public demonstration of telepathy and mass hypnosis at a local theater.
Von Wenk and his men attend Weltemann''s show. Weltemann is none other than Mabuse in disguise, and his magic show provides him an opportunity to hypnotize von Wenk, who falls into a trance. Mabuse''s secret command to von Wenk is to leave the auditorium, get in his car, and drive off a cliff, but von Wenk''s men intercede just in time. Coming to his senses, von Wenk orders a siege of Mabuse''s house.
Dr. Mabuse and his men make a final stand. In the ensuing gunfight, Hawasch and Fine are killed, Spoerri and Georg are taken into custody, and the Countess is rescued. Dr. Mabuse flees through an underground sewer to Hawasch''s counterfeiting workshop, where he becomes trapped, as the doors cannot be opened from the inside. There, Mabuse is confronted by the ghosts of his victims and various demonic illusions.
Spoerri, under interrogation, identifies a key found at Mabuse''s mansion as being for the workshop. Von Wenk and the police break in and take the now-insane Dr. Mabuse away.','["Fritz Lang"]','["Norbert Jacques","Fritz Lang"]','["Rudolf Klein-Rogge","Aud Egede-Nissen","Gertrude Welcker"]','[""]','7.9','["tt0023563","tt0015175","tt0024651","tt0015174","tt0012494","tt0054371","tt0019415","tt0015064","tt2254552","tt2306521","tt0019901","tt0012364"]','["thriller;Lang;feature films"]','[{"url":"/Dr.MabuseTheGamblerdr.MabuseDerSpieler1922Part1_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/DrMabuseDerSpielerPart11922_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','Dr.MabuseTheGamblerdr.MabuseDerSpieler1922Part1',16596,'Q708497','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Upon his arrival, David receives a very warm welcome from his father, Dan, who makes a living breeding race horses. Dan is disappointed, however, when David tells him they are not to live as a married couple on the farm, but plans to move to Indianapolis. Ruth, who has looked forward to join the sophisticated social life in Chicago is also disappointed by the news.
Ruth is quite satisfied when they move to Indianapolis and buy a vast strip of land where David starts his new job. Soon, David visits Oxford to watch his father''s new horse debut on the track. A mistake by the groom leads to the horse being severely injured, and can only be used for breeding in the future.
Dan makes an attempt to breed the horse with Joe Patchen, a reputable stud from Illinois, and the resulting colt is named Dan Patch. The colt soon grows into a strong horse, ready to train for the race track with Dan''s horse trainer, Ben Lathrop.
One day David gets a visit from Ben and his tomboy teenage daughter Cissy at the estate. The visitors are treated poorly by Ruth, who has turned into an up-and-coming socialité and shows no interest in horse breeding. Ben tells David that Dan Patch has made a record training run before he and his daughter leave.
It is not until his aunt Netty sends him a telegram that David learns about his father''s illness. He rushes to Oxford and is by his father''s side as he passes. David makes a promise to his dying father that he will continue training Dan Patch. For this purpose he brings the horse home with him and builds a race track on the estate. Ruth is not at all happy with the development. As they quarrel, David realizes that he doesn''t love her anymore.
However, the training is successful, and Dan Patch wins his first race at a county fair. Soon the horse is ready for the big races, and he wins in Detroit, Cleveland and Columbus. In Kentucky, Ben becomes ill and David gets to take his place as a driver. Since the other drivers refuse to race, realizing their horse won''t beat Dan Patch, the horse gets to race against time, and breaks the record, running a mile in under two minutes.
Because of some trouble at David''s regular work at the chemistry company, Ruth tells him to come home and solve it, not willing to risk her high maintenance lifestyle. David sees no other alternative than to return to Indianapolis. When he goes to tell Ben and Cissy, he sees one of the younger drivers, Bud Ransome, talk to Cissy. Later, a fire breaks out in the stables, and David and Cissy manage to put it out, saving the horses.
When David comes back to Ruth, he tells her he has decided to sell the estate, quit his job and continue breeding horses instead. She demands a divorce, refusing to live on the farm with him.  Rith gets most of their assets in the divorce, and David keeps the farm and Dan Patch. Cissy is overjoyed that he has returned, having had a crush on him for years.
David understands he is in love with young Cissy, and together they decide to sell Dan Patch for $60,000 to be able to live on the farm and continue breeding horses. David and Cissy eventually marry and are blessed with a daughter.
The horse goes on to break his own record, running a mile in 1 minute fifty-six seconds in 1906. He also makes a lot of money from different commercial deals, involving using his name on promotional goods. In his last race, watched by David and his family, Dan Patch beats his own record by a full second.','["Joseph M.

His co-driver Ed is the widowed father of Jimmy. Ed promised his wife before she died that he would send Jimmy off to a fine military school after winning the "big race". The day before the race finds Jimmy and Ed at home in their apartment, with Mr. and Mrs. Cohen visiting, and reporter Anne Merrit sneaking into Mark''s hotel room for an exclusive interview. Mark agrees to give her the interview she needs over a dinner table. She break the date she already has for the night with her boss Larry Winston and goes out with Mark. Larry Winston walks into the same restaurant Mark and Anne are dining at, and sees them. Larry walks over to their table and has Anne introduce him to Mark. The two men become rivals.
On the day of the race, Mark gets behind when a tire goes flat. He enters the track again and starts to take the lead. While on the last lap, Mark loses control of his car and spins out just as he is about to pass the car in the lead. His car comes to a stop and before he can move out of the way, he is hit dead on by another car going full speed. Mark somehow comes out of this accident unscathed, but his partner Ed is killed. Jimmy, now an orphan, is staying with the Cohen''s. Mark returns and the Cohen''s decide to tell him they would like to adopt Jimmy. Before they are able to however, Mark asks Jimmy if he wants to come and live with him at his hotel. Jimmy accepts, Mark promises to send him to that military school, and Mrs. Cohen silently bursts into tears.
Mark sends Jimmy to the URBAN Military Academy and hits the track again with his new co-driver Howard. Unfortunately, Mark is plagued by crude flashbacks of Ed and the accident. He tells Howard he is through with racing and walks away. Strapped for cash, Mark leaves his fancy hotel, moves in with Mr. and Mrs. Cohen, and takes a job as a taxi driver to pay for Jimmy''s school. While waiting for customers, Mark gets into a fight with another cabbie for being in the wrong space. Anne, who has been unable to find Mark since he moved, spots him in his taxi and finds his new residence through his license number. Anne promises to not mention Marks "fall from fame" and has dinner with him. While dropping Anne off at her office, Mark is spotted by Larry Winston. Larry asks Anne who her taxi driver was and when she does not tell him, he comes to the correct conclusion on his own. Larry promises to Anne that he will not say anything about Mark''s new career, but later breaks his promise when he delivers his news report the next afternoon.
Mark hears this report on the radio and becomes infuriated. Jimmy also hears the report with his school mates and is laughed out of the room. Mark hurries to confront Anne and does not believe her when she says she didn''t say anything. While there, he gets into another argument with two other cabbies. Jimmy comes to the conclusion that Mark cannot afford to keep him at URBAN, so he sneaks out of a window and returns to the Cohen''s apartment for a "surprise visit". Mark is at first happy, but then becomes upset when Jimmy refuses to return school. Two rival cab drivers go to Mark''s home and begin tearing up his cab. Mark goes out and gets into an all out brawl with them. Jimmy gets caught up in the middle and is hit in the head with a flying wrench, which "crushes" his skull. Anne tells Mark more or less to drive Jimmy to this hospital as quick as he can. Over time, Jimmy recovers and is later seen in the hospital talking to friends.

All are in disagreement until the congress''s president, the engineer Maboul of France, explains his plans for an "Aero-Bus," an airplane with a passenger car and a huge figurehead in the shape of a bird head. The proceedings are interrupted by a group of militant suffragettes, who announce their intention to go to the Pole themselves. When they have been chased off, the Congress nominates an international group of experts to accompany Maboul to the Pole: Run-Ever of England, Bluff-"Allo"-Bill of America, Choukroutman of Germany, Cerveza of Spain, Tching-Tchun of China, and Ka-Ko-Ku of Japan. Maboul takes his colleagues to his office to study the model of his invention, and then to the electricity-powered factory where the real thing is being constructed. The leader of the suffragettes moves on with her own plans to get to the Pole, building a machine fitted with propellers and a multitude of toy balloons, but it fails to get off the ground.
The completed Aero-Bus lifts off to great acclaim, though it meets with two difficulties; first the suffragette leader tries to board with the expedition at the last moment, and then the explorer Tching-Tchun, arriving late, is accidentally left behind. The race to the Pole attracts many other adventurers, who depart in their own machines; soon the sky is full of aircraft of every shape and size. Both Tching-Tchun and the suffragette leader attempt to make it to the Pole in a balloon, but again meet with failure. (The explorer falls a short distance to the ground and gives up; the suffragette, having held on longer, falls onto a church steeple and explodes.) Meanwhile, the Aero-Bus continues through the sky unimpeded, passing various planets and constellations.
The aircraft skims down over the ice of the Arctic and finally crash-lands. The delegates make it out of the wreck, safe and sound. Almost immediately, however, they run into an obstacle: the Giant of the Snows, a pipe-smoking, man-eating frost giant who has to be scared off with cannon fire. They come at last to the pole proper, where they find a huge magnetic needle. Stuck by magnetic attraction to the needle, which breaks under their weight and plunges them into the icy waters, they signal for help and are picked up by a passing airship. Penguins, seals, and Arctic birds wave goodbye.

Even though the central character''s intentions are good, he cannot win, no matter how inventively he tries. He gets into various scraps with police officers throughout the film. Eventually, he unwittingly throws a bomb into a police parade and ends up being chased by a horde of cops.
At the end of the film, Keaton''s character locks up the cops in the police station. However, the girl he is trying to woo disapproves of his behavior and gives him the cold shoulder. Therefore, he unlocks the police station and is immediately pulled in by the cops. The film ends with the title "The End" written on a tombstone with Keaton''s pork pie hat propped on it.
One of Keaton''s most iconic and brilliantly-constructed short films, Cops was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in their National Film Registry in 1997.',NULL,'["Buster Keaton","Edward F.

One stormy night in 1810, family patriarch John McKay and his rival James Canfield kill each other. After the tragic death of her husband, John''s wife decides her son Willie will not suffer the same fate. She moves to New York to live with her sister, who after the mother''s death raises him without telling him of the feud.
Twenty years later, Willie receives a letter informing him that his father''s estate is now his. His aunt tells him of the feud, but he decides to return to his Southern birthplace anyway to claim his inheritance. On the train ride, he meets a girl, Virginia. They are shy to each other at first, but become acquainted during many train mishaps. At their destination, she is greeted by her father and two brothers; she, it turns out, is a Canfield. Willie innocently asks one of the brothers where the McKay estate is. The brother offers to show him the way, but stops at every shop in search of a pistol to shoot the unsuspecting Willie. By the time he obtains one, Willie has wandered off. Willie is very disappointed to discover the McKay "estate" is a rundown home, not the stately mansion he had imagined. Later, however, he encounters Virginia, who invites him to supper.
When he arrives, the brothers want to shoot him, but the father refuses to allow it while he is a guest in their mansion. The father refers to this as "our hospitality". When Willie overhears a conversation between the brothers, he finally realizes his grave predicament. A parson comes to supper as well. Afterward, the parson prepares to leave, but he finds it is raining furiously. The Canfield patriarch insists the parson stay the night. McKay invites himself to do the same.
The next morning, McKay stays inside the house, while the Canfield men wait for his departure. The father catches McKay kissing his daughter. McKay finally manages to leave safely by putting on a woman''s dress. However, a chase ensues. He eventually starts down a steep cliff side, but is unable to find a way to the bottom. One Canfield lowers a rope (so he can get a better shot) to which Willie ties himself, but the Canfield falls into the water far below, dragging Willie along. Finally, Willie manages to steal the train locomotive and tender, but the tender derails, dumping him into the river towards the rapids. Virginia spots him and goes after him in a rowboat; she falls into the water and is swept over the edge of the large waterfall. McKay swings trapeze-like on a rope, catching her hands in mid-fall and depositing her safely on a ledge.
When it grows dark, the Canfield men decide to continue their murderous search the next day. Returning home, they see Willie and Virginia embracing; Joseph Canfield furiously rushes into the room, gun in hand.  He is brought up short by the parson, who asks him if he wishes to kiss the bride. Seeing a hanging "love thy neighbor" sampler, the father decides to bless the union and end the feud. The Canfields place their pistols on a table; Willie then divests himself of the many guns he took from their gun cabinet.',NULL,'["Jean C.

Feeling sullen and still unable to deal with having someone else''s hands, Vernon seeks comfort from his girlfriend, Eileen, but she is unsympathetic.

Next, while at a local fair, Vernon is tortured by images of player pianos and bumper cars, and nearly strangles to death a carnival barker.

He is estranged from wife Katherine (Maureen O''Hara), who left him two years before, suspecting him of adultery. She has been living as a socialite back East while their daughter Rebecca (whom G.W. calls "Becky") (Stefanie Powers) is completing her college degree.

Following a meeting with a group of homesteaders whom he cautions against trying to farm on the Mesa Verde: "God made that land for the buffalo. It serves pretty well for cattle. But it hates the plow! And even the government should know you can''t farm six thousand feet above sea level!"
He hires one of them, an attractive widow named Louise Warren (Yvonne De Carlo), as his cook and housekeeper. G.W. welcomes both her and her two children into his home, including grown son Dev (Patrick Wayne), who is handy with his fists, good with cattle, and is an excellent chess player, who had to leave Purdue University on account of his father''s death.

Katherine (a.k.a. Katie), returns to the town of McLintock, seeking a divorce from G.W.  He declines to give her one, having no idea why she has been so angry with him and why she moved out two years ago.
Following a misunderstanding which leads to a Comanche subchief nearly being lynched by a hotheaded settler father who believes his daughter has been kidnapped, there is a gigantic brawl at the mud slide by one of McLintock''s mines. Surprisingly, Katherine gets involved in the brawl, fighting on her estranged husband''s behalf as she takes a quill from her hat and sticks It in one of the participants backsides. She attempts the same maneuver on G.W. However, this backfired as G.W. Inadvertently knocks Katherine down the mudslide, causing her to get muddy in the pool at the bottom. McClintock soon follows, knocking Katherine in the mud again, which she gets up and yells furiously at G.W. “You and your friends.” The eventually stops when “Running Buffalo”
tells McClintock from the top of the mudslide “Whoooa Maclin, Whoooa, Marlin, good party, but no whiskey, we go home” as the Indians disperse from the area. 
Rebecca "Becky" McLintock returns to town, along with her banjo-playing love interest, "Junior" Douglas (Jerry Van Dyke). Junior is approved of by Katherine but not G.W. However, she soon falls for Dev (of whom G.W. approves wholeheartedly), and they become engaged after he takes her across his knee and spanks her with a coal shovel following a sharp exchange between them. When they announce the engagement, G.W. and Mrs. Warren both give their blessings.
The same train that brought Becky home from college also brought back Chief Puma of the Comanche tribe, an honored enemy and blood brother of G.W., who has been released from prison by the federal government. The territorial governor is out to force the local Comanche tribe off their lands and onto a reservation near Fort Sill.
At the request of Chief Puma, McLintock acts as the spokesman for the Comanche, translating Puma''s speech into English at the kangaroo court hearing organized by Governor Humphrey. The governor announces that the Indians will be moved to Oklahoma, and Chief Puma and his subchiefs are imprisoned again. Disgusted by the mistreatment of Puma and his people, G.W. arranges a break out and an Army train is looted of a cargo of Krag-Jorgenson rifles and ammunition. The Comanche head out on what Puma had called "the last fight of the Comanche," hotly pursued by the local troop of U.S. Cavalry. This has the effect of bringing what Humphrey and Agard, the local Indian agent, have been doing to the attention of Washington. It is implied that both will shortly be removed from office.
At the Fourth of July celebration during which the Comanche breakout takes place, Katherine gets "tarred and feathered" with molasses and goose feathers in the general store.  When she leaves to change clothing in the hotel, McLintock has finally had enough of Katherine''s bad behavior. Everyone tells him to spank her, which he doesn''t believe in. But following one too many insults, G.W. pursues Katherine (who is now dressed in nothing but her corset and slip) through the streets and shops of the town like Nemesis. After an epic chase, during which Katherine loses her slip and is down to bloomers and corset, G.W. learns why she left. As a compromise for his friend''s requests, he finally catches her and decides that he will spank her bottom with a coal scuttle shovel as punishment, and tells her that now she can have her divorce. However, Katherine finally decides she does not want a divorce after all, and she and G.W. happily reconcile.','["Andrew V.

('tt0061005','free','The She Beast (1966)','1966','1h 19min','The film starts out in Transylvania with an alcoholic Count Von Helsing (Karlsen) reading from a text, which begins a historical narrative of the witch, Bardella (Riley).
During his reading, the movie flashes back roughly 200 years to a religious service, where a child shows up and reports the location of Bardella. Then by the leadership of the pastor, hysteria breaks out and the congregation sets out to find and kill the witch.  However, one of the villagers warns the others against killing the witch, as he explains the Count must exorcise the witch first, lest she will not die and will linger on as a curse for generations to come.
Nevertheless, the congregation sets out and finds the witch.  Upon finding her, the pastor directs the crowd to take her to the lake, where she will be impaled and dunked to death.  As Bardella is tied into the chair, she curses the people and their descendants for what they are doing and threatens she will return.  The Count and his attendant secretly watch the execution from a distance upon a hilltop and seemingly purposely do not intervene.  Then the story returns to the reflective Von Helsing in his cave.
Next, a young, newly married couple are traveling in a midnight-blue Volkswagen Beetle through the Carpathian Mountains in Transylvania for their honeymoon.  The husband, Philip (Ogilvy), realizes he is lost and stops to look at a map with his wife, Veronica (Steele).  A lawman (Maslansky) happens by and Philip asks for directions and recommendations for overnight lodging.
When they arrive in Vaubrac, they find the town run down and unimpressive, but just before they are to drive on, the hotel owner, Ladislav Groper (Welles), happens upon them and offers them a room, bread and tea — attempting to accommodate their English traditions.  While waiting for their food and tea, they notice Von Helsing strangely swinging on a nearby swing-set.  After they toss aside their garlic that came with their food and tea, Von Helsing immediately comes up to explain why the garlic was in their tea — as protection against Satanism and witchcraft.  He then goes on a verbal diatribe explaining he is an aristocrat (albeit dispossessed of his castle by the current governmental regime) along with relating the history of the Von Helsing family and the Draculas.  In the process, he cons them into buying him a bottle to drink and, wearing on, Von Helsing recounts the story and curse of Bardella the witch.  However, the couple are skeptical.
Quickly tiring of the Count''s recitation, the couple retire to their room for the evening.  During their conversation, Groper rudely intrudes upon the couple''s room without knocking, claiming there is no privacy in the People''s Republic.  Offended, Philip requests a different room, but is denied.  Nevertheless, once Groper leaves, the couple become romantic together.  However they are interrupted again, this time by Groper watching their lovemaking through the window.  Philip scrambles to beat up Groper.  Returning to his wife, he wants to leave Vaubrac; but Veronica decides she wants to stay and reassures him that Groper is too badly beaten up to bother them again.
The next morning, they attempt to leave early, but Philip finds Groper stole the distributor cap from their car, of which he promptly retrieves.  Driving down the road, Philip loses steering control of the Volkswagen and narrowly misses hitting a delivery truck head-on, but causing him to crash into a lake.  Veronica''s body is then possessed by the spirit of the 18th-century witch who was killed by the local villagers and is now bent on avenging herself upon them.  Both persons still unconscious, the truck driver (Ennio Antonelli), who has a bad local reputation with the police, retrieves Philip and what he thought was his wife, but was Vardella instead.  He brings them back to Vaubrac, leaving them with Groper, so that the police would not accuse him of any wrongdoing.
Meanwhile, Philip comes to and inquires to Groper about his wife.  When Philip realizes that Veronica is missing and something/someone else is in her place, he becomes enraged again at Groper, who denies knowing anything about who the other body is.  Suddenly Von Helsing arrives and takes notice that the woman that was mistaken as Veronica is indeed Bardella having returned.  Then he reassures Philip that he can help him get his wife back.
Von Helsing asks Philip a series of questions regarding the accident, and then takes him back to his cave, where he lives.  He begins reading from a record book entitled, "The Death of Bardella the Witch".  Philip then grows frustrated and impatient with what he regards as unrelated to his missing wife, and finally leaves on foot in order to report the incident to the police.  Von Helsing then goes in pursuit of him in his yellow roadster, an early model Citroën.
However, Von Helsing does not find Philip, but arrives back in town, where he visits Bardella, in order to bring her back to life.  Meanwhile, Groper is heavily drinking, watching porn and gorging his face with food.  The witch comes back to life, momentarily attacking and strangling Von Helsing, then leaves.  Groper''s niece (Lucretia Love) shows up horrified, seeking protection from scary noises she had heard, which were due to the screeching Bardella had been making.  However, Groper invites her in and attempts to rape her, but breaking free of him, she escapes.
Groper goes after her, but once outside he is confronted by Philip, whom he clobbers with his bottle of alcohol, leaving him unconscious in the road to be run over by traffic.  The truck driver happens by again, but swerves to miss him.  Later Von Helsing comes upon him and drags him out of the road.  Meanwhile, Groper is heavily drinking again, when all the sudden Vardella comes upon him and attacks and kills him with a hammer and sickle.
Von Helsing and Philip take off to find Bardella.  Again, Philip wants to go to the police, but while driving, Von Helsing explains Bardella has returned and if she were to be gunned down by police, he would not be able to perform the exorcism necessary on the witch in order to bring Veronica back.  Slowly, Philip begins believing in Von Helsing and what he says.
Meanwhile, back in town, there is an illegal cockfight going on; and Vardella has gone on a killing spree against the descendants of the people who had tortured and killed her hundreds of years before.  On foot through town, Von Helsing and Philip begin searching for Bardella.  Bardella shows up at the cockfight to get revenge on the villagers there.  Von Helsing comes upon the scene and uses a syringe to drug the witch.  They load her in his roadster and take her back to the hotel''s kitchen and put her on ice for safekeeping.  Then they go to Von Helsing''s cave to pick up some ritual tools in order to exorcise Bardella.
After being jailed, the truck driver makes a deal to tell police where Bardella is in exchange for his freedom.  He leads the police back to the hotel, where they find the drugged witch.  The comrade police lieutenant intends to have Bardella autopsied and buried, which would ruin any chances of bringing Veronica back.  Reneging, the police lieutenant takes the truck driver back into custody.  Returning to the hotel from Von Helsing''s cave, Philip and the Count find Bardella missing. So they head to the police station and steal back Vardella''s body out from under them.
A car chase ensues, with Von Helsing and Philip in the paddy wagon and the police driving Von Helsing''s roadster.  The roadster momentarily stalls, enabling Von Helsing and Philip to evade them.  However, Von Helsing realizes the ritual tools he needs to bring Veronica back are in his car, so they pull over and the police catch up with them.  While laying in the paddy wagon, Bardella awakens from her drugged state.  She then attacks the approaching police officers.  Von Helsing uses his syringe to drug Bardella again, as well as the police officers.
They carry Bardella to the roadster and transport her to the lake, where they find the dunking chair.  They strap her into the chair, perform a ritual and drop her into the water, where she disappears.  Philip panics.  But suddenly Veronica floats to the surface and her husband retrieves her.  Veronica and Philip are reunited.
In the end, the three of them are seen driving off in Von Helsing''s Citroën, out of Transylvania to Czechoslovakia.  Due to the havoc that Von Helsing wrought in Vaubrac, he decides to leave the country for England with his two new friends, although he feels his exorcism services might still be needed for future devilry in his native land.  Light-heartedly, Philip jokes about the inhospitality of Vaubrac and is relieved by leaving.  But on the other hand, Veronica seemingly has good feelings about Vaubrac and Transylvania altogether, claiming in the end, "I''ll be back", echoing what Vardella had threatened before she was tortured and killed two hundred years earlier.','["Michael Reeves"]',NULL,'["Barbara Steele","John Karlsen","Ian Ogilvy"]','["Comedy","Horror","Thriller"]','4.5','["tt0058307","tt0060049","tt0057522","tt0060097","tt0062292","tt0057993","tt0056315","tt0060109","tt0057078","tt0057924","tt0064888","tt0058606"]','["Transylvania; witches; Barbara Steele; horror"]','[{"url":"/TheSheBeast.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/TheSheBeast_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','TheSheBeast',65456,'Q3419019','wp','["Michael Reeves"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Red puts him on the inaugural stagecoach from Elkhorn to Denver, Colorado where he will meet his only surviving relative, an Aunt that he has never met.  Dickie is riding with the Land Commissioner on his way to Denver to report the dishonest dealings of the town''s boss Big Bill Lambert.  Lambert owns the new Denver stagecoach line so he can control communications as the telegraph line to Denver has not been opened, and wants to ensure that the Land Commissioner does not make it to Denver.
One of Big Bill''s henchmen stops the stage on the excuse that the driver forgot a bag of US Mail.  Once the driver places the bag of mail with the other mail sacks the henchman sabotages the horse harness that leads to the stagecoach going off a cliff killing the driver and commissioner but leaving Dickie paralysed.  The town Doctor''s diagnosis is that Dickie''s only chance to walk again would be a risky operation that can only be approved by Dickie''s next of kin, the aunt in Denver.  Red has the idea to use the telegraph at a mine that has a connection with a mine near Denver where the news requiring Dickie''s Aunt and a new Land Commissioner to come to Elkhorn can be relayed.  Worried about the Commissioner''s message, Big Bill sends some henchmen to stop Red from sending his message but fail miserably.
In Denver, Big Bill''s associates have the idea to waylay the stagecoach carrying the real replacement Land Commissioner and Aunt and replace them with an impersonator to masquerade as a Land Commissioner and to establish his veracity, sends a tough woman in the gang to impersonate the Aunt.  Once in town the phony Commissioner follows Big Bill''s orders to resurvey the lands of the area for Big Bill''s benefit, but the woman impersonating the Aunt is touched and reformed by Dickie and endangers herself when she won''t go along with Big Bill''s schemes and stands up to him.','["R.G.

Aboard the station, a group of starfish-like beings discuss how to warn humans of an impending disaster, deciding on contacting Japanese scientist Dr. Kumara. Meanwhile, flying saucers are spotted over the skies of Tokyo, baffling scientists. A journalist tries to get a statement from Dr. Kumara about the sightings, but Kumara replies that there is not enough evidence to formulate a hypothesis. At an observatory, Professor Isobe spots an object in his telescope apparently releasing smaller objects.
Isobe discusses his findings with Kumara and a physician, Dr. Matsuda, who believes they should get photographs via a rocket. The photographs they retrieve, however, turn out to be unclear, though they deduce the object has a high energy output. In the meantime, the extraterrestrials have been unsuccessfully attempting to contact humans. They begin appearing in lakes and rivers, frightening local fishermen and sailors. One of the aliens manages to secure a photo of Hikari Aozora, a famous Japanese entertainer.  Their plan is for one of the aliens to mutate into the form of Aozora.  Back aboard the space station, one of the Pairan leaders, Ginko, volunteers herself. Her starfish form is slowly mutated into a human form.

On Earth, Toru, Isobe''s son, discovers the disguised alien floating in the water. After her rescue, she exhibits superhuman characteristics such as jumping ten feet and materializing in different places without walking. Soon, she disrupts Dr. Matsuda''s work on a nuclear device, explaining she understands the complex equations he was writing and warning against the effects of a device, leading him to believe she is not human. Shortly afterwards, as the team of scientists discuss her abnormal traits, the camouflaged Ginko appears and reveals her true identity, explaining she is from Paira, a world on the same orbit as Earth but on the opposite side of the Sun. She then continues to reveal her mission, to warn Earth of an imminent collision of a rogue planet, which is dubbed "Planet R" by the media. They appeal to the World Congress about the situation, but are swiftly rejected. Only after they show Planet R and its rapid acceleration in the telescope does the World Congress launch its nuclear weapons, which ineffectively explode on its surface.
In the meantime, a group of spies have abducted Matsuda and are attempting to steal his formula to the nuclear device the disguised Pairan warned him about. Matsuda does not comply and is eventually tied to a chair in a remote building. As the Earth''s atmosphere heats up due to the approaching world, Ginko again arrives to learn why Planet R is not yet destroyed. They locate Matsuda through Pairan technology and gather the formula for the device. The scientists then all watch as the nuclear device is shot from the space station and destroys Planet R, cooling the atmosphere and removing the threat. Ginko then changes back to her original form aboard the space station.','["Kôji Shima"]','["Jay Cipes","Gentaro Nakajima"]','["Keizô Kawasaki","Toyomi Karita","Bin Yagisawa"]','[""]','4.4','["tt0062360","tt0053250","tt0046186","tt0044167","tt0080904","tt0047149","tt0049782","tt0149677","tt0271367","tt0051413","tt0055294","tt0046066"]','["alien; Japan; bomb; sci-fi;"]','[{"url":"/Warning_From_Space.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Warning_From_Space_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/Warning_From_Space_MPEG_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','Warning_From_Space_MPEG',9772,'Q7969831','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The plan is to cut down the entire tree population in Antler Valley, a place where lumbering previously has been impossible because of the resistance from the fierce inhabitants. Adams, who is to co-sign the deal, expresses his surprise over the plan.
Lorimer is determined to go through with the plan and brings his men to the site, led by the tough foreman Hodge Mason. As the work proceeds, a number of "accidents" occur, and Lorimer believes that the Cain family is responsible.
Lorimer goes to see them but they claim to have nothing to do with it, and the reason is they know Lorimer is working for the military and a valuable cause.
A young man named John Gordon comes looking for a job, and flirts with Lorimer''s daughter Perry as soon as he enters the company premises. She shows no interest in the arrogant man. Still, he is hired to help lumbering.
One night, John discovers a forest fire and the men start extinguishing it. Lorimer is killed by a tree falling in the effort and Perry takes charge of the company in his place.
The camp manager, Frank Barnes, asks Perry to marry him, and Adams tries to buy her share of the company, but she refuses them both. It turns out the entire Cain family was killed in the fire, and the suspicions about their involvement are abandoned.
John is put on household work after burning his hands in the fire, and the accidents continue to happen in the forest. When a man falls to his death after his safety rope is cut, Frank talks to the sheriff. Suspicions arise that the cook, Eric, who is an immigrant, is the one responsible.
The next accident is a dynamite explosion that causes the earth to move and stop the lumber transport by train to its destination at the sawmill. Eric is cleared of suspicion, and John tries to investigate the cause of the accident. He is almost hit by a bullet when he is riding in the forest, but instead the entire supply of dynamite is ignited and explodes. The others soon suspect John of trying to sabotage the lumbering.
More dynamite is delivered, and John develops a plan to reveal who the saboteur is by claiming to have proof of the culprit. He shows them a bullet as proof and hides the bullet by his bnk bed. In the night Mason, the foreman, retrieves the bullet from its hiding place and is seen by Olaf, who knows about the plan.
Olaf tells John about it by writing him a note which he passes to him during a card game in which both John and Mason takes part. Mason picks a fight with John in order to get a chance to shoot him, but Frank breaks it up.
The next day John tells Perry that he believes Frank to be in cahoots with Mason. He also reveals to her that he is the son of late owner Hamilton, who got a share of the company as inheritance on the condition he serve as a lumberjack for some time.
Since Frank is in the forest to clear up for the transport with dynamite, john and Perry suspect he is to do further sabotage to the train transport. They ride into the forest to stop him, but Perry is rendered unconscious after a blow to the head.
Frank lets the train run towards the stack of dynamite he has prepared, and where Mason is ready. The lumber cars manage to pass before the dynamite disintegrates the rail and the rest of the train. John finds Perry and brings her back to camp. The sheriff arrives to apprehend both Frank and Mason.','["Bernard B.

The supporting cast includes George "Gabby" Hayes, the acrobatic comedian Al St. John, and the stuntman Yakima Canutt. The movie was written and directed by Robert N. Bradbury. It was the first of the Lone Star Productions released through Monogram Pictures.  The actual singer, who was singing as this film and Lawless Range were being made, was Bill Bradbury, son of director Robert N. Bradbury and brother of Robert A. Bradbury a.k.a. Bob Steele. Glenn Strange did the singing in Lawless Range.
Wayne''s dubbed singing, which bore no resemblance to his unique speaking voice, was the reason he soon abandoned the singing cowboy format, as he later played a singing cowboy—though not Singin'' Sandy—at least once, in Lawless Range, but he was embarrassed during personal appearances when he couldn''t accommodate children who clamored for a Singin'' Sandy song. Gene Autry was chosen by the studio as Wayne''s replacement in the new genre, immediately solving the live singing problem while ushering in a much lighter take on the format than Wayne''s grimly intense rendition.','["Robert N.

They persuade a reluctant Allan Quartermain (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) to give them a lift to the coast in his wagon.
Along the way, they encounter another wagon carrying two men in bad shape. Umbopa (Paul Robeson) recovers, but Silvestra (Arthur Goullet) dies after boasting to Quartermain that he has found the way to the fabled mines of Solomon. Patsy finds the dead man''s map. He sneaks off during the night, unwilling to risk his daughter''s life. Kathy is unable to persuade Quatermain to follow him. Instead, they rendezvous with Quartermain''s new clients, Sir Henry Curtis (John Loder) and retired navy Commander Good (Roland Young), out for a bit of big game hunting.
Kathy steals Quartermain''s wagon to go after her father. When they catch up with her, she refuses to go back with them, so they and Umbopa accompany her across the desert and over the mountains, as shown on the map. During the arduous trek, Curtis and Kathy fall in love. On the other side of the mountains, they are surrounded by unfriendly natives and taken to the kraal of their chief, Twala (Robert Adams), to be questioned. Twala takes them to see the entrance of the mines, guarded by the feared witch doctor Gagool (an uncredited Sydney Fairbrother).
That night, Umbopa reveals that he is the son of the former chief, who was treacherously killed by the usurper Twala. He meets with dissidents, led by Infadoos (Ecce Homo Toto), who are fed up with Twala''s cruel reign. Together, they plot an uprising for the next day, during the ceremony of the "smelling out of the evildoers". However, Umbopa needs Quartermain to come up with something that will counter (in the natives'' minds) the magic of Gagool.
During the rite, Gagool chooses several natives, who are killed on the spot. Recalling making a bet on last year''s Derby Day, Good notices in his diary that there will be a total solar eclipse that day at exactly 11:15 A.M. The quick-thinking Quartermain predicts it as Gagool approaches Umbopa. Umbopa reveals his true identity to the people during the height of the eclipse and the rebellion erupts. Both sides gather their forces; during the ensuing battle, Curtis kills Twala, ending the civil war.
In the fighting, Kathy slips away to the mine to look for her father. She finds him inside, immobilised by a broken leg, but clutching a pouch full of diamonds. It was revealed that the mine was connected to a volcano. Quartermain, Curtis and Good follow her, but Gagool sets off a rockfall to seal them in. Umbopa pursues Gagool back into the mine, where the witch doctor is crushed by falling rocks.

It has no voiceover or commentary. The activities captured include the welcoming of foreign diplomats and other party members and politicians – such as Franz von Papen – at the Nuremberg train station; Adolf Hitler''s arrival at the airport and his meeting with important party members such as Joseph Goebbels and Hermann Göring; massive Sturmabteilung (SA, colloquially known as "Brownshirts") parades; and Hitler''s speech on the assumption of power by the party, and the tenth anniversary of the German National Socialist movement.
The events shown are in roughly chronological order, starting with the arrival of Hitler in Nuremberg and the welcome given by the Nuremberg Gauleiter, Julius Streicher. Rudolf Hess is shown sitting next to Hitler, and the Fuhrer passes him a bunch of flowers given to him by admirers. Hitler is also shown in several cameos with Ernst Röhm, then leader of the SA. The welcome includes a speech from a senior official of the Italian National Fascist Party, Arturo Marpicati, with conveyed greetings from Benito Mussolini. It is followed by the rally on the vast parade ground recently built by Albert Speer, and includes a shot of a Zeppelin airship floating by, complete with swastika on the tailfin. There is also a separate rally of Hitler Youth, with an introduction by Baldur von Schirach. There follows a march past in the streets of the old city, with the party leaders receiving the salutes of the massed goosestepping ranks of the SA and the SS. Familiar faces include Hermann Göring and a brief cameo appearance of Heinrich Himmler, who would be the star of  Riefenstahl''s next propaganda film, The Triumph of the Will, after his and Gōring''s successful efforts incite Hitler to massacre the leadership of the SA.

However, as soon as Zontar arrives on Earth via a fallen laser satellite it quickly becomes obvious that the skeletal black creature has a hidden agenda, as it begins causing local power outages that stop telephones, automobiles and even running water from working, and it starts taking control of people''s minds using flying lobster-like "injecto-pods" that sprout from its wings. Only after his wife is killed does Ritchie finally realize that Zontar has come not as a savior but as a conqueror, and he goes to confront the hideous alien in the sulfur spring-heated cave that it has made its secret base.','["Larry Buchanan"]','["Hillman Taylor","Larry Buchanan"]','["John Agar","Susan Bjurman","Tony Huston"]','["Horror","Sci-Fi"]','3.2','["tt0054462","tt0049370","tt0060270","tt0050545","tt0056127","tt0059161","tt0052969","tt0050147","tt0050210","tt0051381","tt0045917","tt0061529"]','["alien; invasion; sci-fi; Cold War"]','[{"url":"/Zontar_Thing_From_Venus_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/Zontar_the_Thing_From_Venus.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Zontar_the_Thing_From_Venus_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','Zontar_Thing_From_Venus',65366,'Q3073796','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

While staying at a boarding house, he is mistaken by the drunk Michael McGuire (Finlay Currie) for his long-lost son, Dennis, whom McGuire had abandoned to an orphanage as a child, a deed for which he now deeply blames himself.
Later that night, Connor attempts to rob John Gamble (Richard Boone) outside a gambling house, but after he finds him equally broke, he is talked into assisting him in robbing the establishment, during which the owner is shot.
Connor and Gamble make off with the loot, stopping at the boarding house to get Connor''s gear, whereupon McGuire, still drunk, pursues his "son" down the street until he collapses. They find on him information on his extensive station (for which he was trying to secure loans in Sydney) and his boat ticket, and decide to pose as his business partners to get on the boat and away to hide out with him in the Outback.
The next day, the now sober McGuire does not remember anything, and is at first suspicious of them, until he finds he has the £500 they claimed to have paid him for cattle (planted on him from the stolen loot). Along the way (first by boat, then by horse) they subtly drop hints that Connor (now calling himself Dennis Connor) may be his lost son, without letting on that McGuire himself had talked about him, in this way hoping to gain possession of the station.
Arriving at the station, they are both smitten by his daughter Dell (Maureen O''Hara), but held in some suspicion by the local trooper Len (Chips Rafferty), who has been Dell''s local beau.
Gamble does his best to scotch a budding attraction between Dell and Connor, because it will spoil the plan to pass him off as her lost brother.
Biding their time both to develop their plan and hide out from the law, they end up helping the station get back on its feet, rescuing stray cattle, heading off a stampede, and culminating in a daring repair of an out-of-control windmill during a windstorm.
McGuire is finally convinced that Connor is his son, and seeing the romantic interest of his daughter in him, tells her his conclusion. Overhearing her despair at this news, Connor feels he must confess, and Gamble sees their plan fail on the brink of success because of the annoying conscience of his partner.
Having confessed not only to not be Dennis, but to be wanted in the murder of the gambling house owner, Connor and Gamble flee the station, with trooper Len in hot pursuit.
When he catches up to them, Gamble is about to shoot him when Connor pulls the gun away with a bullwhip. The two partners in crime now have a vicious bullwhip fight.
Gamble retrieves the gun and shoots at Connor, but Len fatally shoots Gamble. Len then takes Connor back to the McGuire station, where he recovers from his injuries, being promised clemency for saving Len''s life, and with the promise of a future with Dell.','["Lewis Milestone"]','["Harry Kleiner","Martin Berkeley"]','["Maureen O''Hara","Peter Lawford","Finlay Currie"]','["Adventure","Drama","Western"]','5.5','["tt0091325","tt0042539","tt0035860","tt0035421","tt0043072","tt0041382","tt0044380","tt0044907","tt0048331","tt0041149","tt0046979","tt0045077"]','["Australia ; Lewis Milestone ; Aborigines ; Peter Lawford ; Maureen O''Hara ;"]','[{"url":"/Kangaroo.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/Kangaroo_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','kangaroo',34990,'Q3210106','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

While sunbathing on a dock, Judy saves an elderly man (Barry Fitzgerald) from drowning. She assumes from his disheveled appearance and folksy demeanor that he is poor, and calls him "Pop". She gives him her name and tells him where she works, and encourages him to contact her if he ever needs help again.
Unbeknownst to her, the man is the wealthy Jerry Bates, whom his lawyer Curtis (Robert Benchley) refers to as "J.B." Bates instructs Curtis to anonymously reward Judy with everything her heart desires. Curtis sends a letter to Judy at the Stork Club, informing her she now has a new luxury apartment, and a line of credit at a prestigious department store, with no strings attached.
Bates, donning shabby clothes to conceal his wealth, visits Judy at the club. Assuming he is unemployed, she convinces the maitre d'' to hire him as a busboy, a position Bates quickly sabotages. 
Bates returns to the club to see Judy receive the letter. She promptly goes on a shopping spree, buying dresses and furs without knowing her benefactor''s identity. 
Assuming Bates is homeless, Judy offers him a room in her new apartment—and Bates, who has formed a fatherly attachment to her, and whose wife has recently left him, accepts.
Danny arrives home with plans to form a new band of top-flight musicians. He is excited to see Judy, until he sees her luxurious apartment and clothes and suspects she has become a "kept woman" in his absence. When he sees Bates at Judy''s apartment, he believes his suspicions have been confirmed and breaks up with her.
Danny finds out Judy has rented the other apartment on her floor for his band, he becomes cool to her. Judy continues to invest in Danny''s band by buying new clothes for them using Bates'' money. Bates is upset and wants to reign in her spending and asks his lawyer Curtis to tell her who he is. Curtis refuses, but Bates catches Curtis in the hallway to tell Curtis he works for him. Curtis begins to tell him he won''t lose much, about $200,000 to $300,000, and not to mention the Gift Tax of 30% of any gift over $3,000. Bates replies, "Coolidge. Oh, for a Coolidge" harking back to days of the Roaring Twenties when President Calvin Coolidge cut both taxes and federal spending to boost America''s economy.
Danny meets with an agent but has trouble finding work for his new band. Judy phones Sherman Billingsley (Bill Goodwin), the Stork Club''s powerful but generous owner, and posing as gossip columnist Walter Winchell, tells him about a fantastic new band he must hear. Billingsley arrives at the apartment, where Danny''s tuxedoed band and Judy perform brilliantly for him. Billingsley offers them a job at the club, then tells Judy: "By the way, I''d know your voice anywhere—and I was having lunch with Winchell when you called."
When Judy meets Bates''s estranged wife, she finally learns that Bates is responsible for her new riches. Seeking to return his kindness, she engineers a reconciliation between them.
Meanwhile, Danny confronts Curtis and learns the truth about Judy''s benefactor. Realizing she has been true to him, Danny apologizes to her—on the bandstand, during a song—and they are reunited.','["Hal Walker"]','["Buddy G.

Among the passengers is big game hunter and author Bob Rainsford.  In discussing the sport with other passengers, Bob is asked if he would exchange places with the animals he hunts. After the yacht''s owner disregards the captain''s concerns about the channel lights not matching the charts, the ship runs aground, takes on water and explodes. Ultimately, Bob is the lone survivor, swimming to a small island. He sees the channel lights off the shoreline change, and suspects the ship was deliberately led off course to its doom. Bob stumbles across a chateau where he becomes the guest of the expatriate Russian Count Zaroff, a fellow hunting enthusiast, who is familiar with Bob and his writings. Zaroff says four other shipwrecked survivors are also guests: Eve Trowbridge, her brother Martin, and two sailors. Later, Zaroff introduces Bob to the Trowbridges, and tells them his obsession with hunting became boring until he discovered "the most dangerous game" on the island.  Bob doesn''t understand Zaroff, who fails to explain further. Eve is suspicious of Zaroff and tells Bob the two sailors that survived with them have not been seen since each visited Zaroff''s trophy room. During the night, when Martin also vanishes, Eve and Bob go to the trophy room where they find the "trophies" are men''s heads.  Zaroff appears with Martin''s body. Now realizing what prey Zaroff hunts, Bob calls him a madman and is restrained. Bob refuses Zaroff''s offer to join him in hunting humans, and Zaroff tells Bob he must be the next prey. Like those before him, Bob will be turned loose at dawn, given a hunting knife and some provisions and allowed the entire day to roam the island until midnight, when Zaroff will begin his hunt.  If Bob survives until 4 a.m., then Bob "wins" the game and Zaroff will give him keys to his boathouse so he can leave the island.  Zaroff then says he has never lost what he terms "outdoor chess." Eve decides to go with Bob, and Zaroff tells Eve he will not hunt her since she is a female; but, if Bob loses, she must return with him. The pair spend most of the day setting a trap for Zaroff. But, when the hunt begins, Zaroff finds the trap and begins a cat and mouse pursuit of Bob. Eventually, Bob and Eve are trapped by a waterfall. When Bob is attacked by a hunting dog, Zaroff shoots and both Bob and the dog fall into the water. Presuming Bob dead, Zaroff takes Eve back to his fortress to enjoy his prize. However, Bob returns to the chalet to Zaroff''s surprise. It seems the dog, not Bob, was shot. Zaroff admits defeat and presents the key to the boathouse, but Bob discovers him holding a gun behind his back. Bob first fights Zaroff, then his henchmen, killing the henchmen and mortally wounding Zaroff. As Bob and Eve speed away in a motor boat, the dying Zaroff tries to shoot them with his bow. Unsuccessful, he succumbs to his wounds, and falls out of a window into the pack of his frenzied hunting dogs, which it is implied "prey" upon him.',NULL,'["James Ashmore Creelman","Richard Connell"]','["Joel McCrea","Fay Wray","Leslie Banks"]','["Action","Adventure","Thriller"]','7.2','["tt6209344","tt0026663","tt0024188","tt1382176","tt0052655","tt0024216","tt0034587","tt0036027","tt0022827","tt0038549","tt0024368","tt0073948"]','["Adventure; Thriller; Horror; Mystery; Fay Wray"]','[{"url":"/TheMostDangerousGame.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/TheMostDangerousGame_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/TheMostDangerousGame_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','TheMostDangerousGame',205228,'Q1541422','wp',NULL,'["Irving Pichel","Ernest B.

Inside the coffin is a card that reads "Reserved for You".Newlyweds Jenni (Peggy Webber) and Eric (John Hudson) move into Eric''s palatial country home. Jenni is Eric''s second wife; his first wife Marion died when she accidentally slipped and hit her head on the edge of a decorative pond on the estate. At the home they meet Eric''s friends, the Reverend Snow (Russ Conway) and his wife (Tony Johnson), as well as Mickey (Alex Nicol), the developmentally disabled gardener. Eric privately mentions to the Snows that Jenni spent time in an asylum following the sudden death of both her parents, and Mrs. Snow reveals that Jenni is very wealthy.
Jenni is disturbed both by Mickey''s belief that Marion''s ghost wanders the estate and by Marion''s self-portrait inside the house, which Jenni believes resembles her mother. When she begins to hear unexplained screaming noises and see skulls around her house, she believes that Marion is haunting her. Though Eric speculates to Jenni that Mickey, who was a childhood friend of Marion and thus dislikes Jenni, may be behind the trickery, Jenni worries that she is going insane. Eric suggests to remove Marion''s self-portrait from the home. Eric and Jenni take the painting outside and burn it, later uncovering a skull from the ashes. Jenni panics at the sight of the skull, but Eric denies that the skull is there. Jenni faints and Eric withdraws the skull and hides it, revealing that he has been gaslighting her all along.
Believing she has finally lost her sanity, Jenni resolves to be committed. She tells Eric that the entire property will be meticulously searched for the skull as a last resort. Mickey secretly steals the skull and brings it to Snow before Eric can retrieve it. That night, Eric prepares to murder Jenni and stage it as a suicide. Jenni sees Marion''s ghost in Mickey''s greenhouse and flees back to the house, where Eric begins throttling her. The ghost appears and chases Eric outside, corners and attacks him, drowning him in the decorative pond.
After Jenni regains consciousness, the Snows arrive. Mrs. Snow comforts a hysterical Jenni and the Reverend discovers Eric''s body in the pond. Some undisclosed time later, Jenni and the Snows depart from the house.

His wife, Madeline (Esther Ralston), has been away for several months, and is not expected back anytime soon. However, Madeline''s mother, Mrs. Mantel (Maude Eburne) is staying with the Smiths, in an effort to curtail the possibility of any straying by Richard. Unbeknownst to her, he has made plans to go out on the town that night with his new, sultry secretary Kitty Minter (Patsy Ruth Miller), and his new sexy client, Diane O''Dare (Laura La Plante), who, a lonely wife herself, wishes to divorce her husband for neglect.
The issue is how can he go out on the town without alerting his mother-in-law. An issue which is seemingly resolved by the arrival at his home of a vaudeville impersonator: Felix, the Great Zero (also played by Edward Everett Horton). Felix is seeking permission to impersonate the famous lawyer on-stage. At first reluctant, Richard, noticing the striking resemblance between himself and the actor, realizes he might have a way to deceive Mrs. Mantel. In order to obtain his approval, Felix must agree to impersonate him at his house that evening, while he goes out.
While Richard goes out on the town, he discovers that Diane''s husband is none other than Felix. Meanwhile, Madeline arrives home unannounced and early.Thinking that he is about to be exposed, Felix phones the nightclub where Richard has taken the two women for dinner and drinks. As he waits for the return phone call, much to his surprise, rather than exposing him as an imposter, Madeline begins to come on to him. He attempts to resist, trying to hold out until he can speak to Richard, but he succumbs to her charms just as the phone begins ringing.
When Richard returns home the next morning, Felix is still there. He is followed closely by a very inebriated Diane, with whom it seems he has spent his time away from home. When Felix recognizes Diane, and Richard understands that Felix has spent the night at his house, both men believe that his look-a-like has slept with the others'' wife. After a series of events, Smith ends up chasing Zero with a loaded gun. Meanwhile, Andrews, the Butler, (Spencer Charters), thinks he must have the DT’s, seeing double of his employer.

The truth comes out when Madeline admits that she knew it wasn''t Richard all along, and other than the kissing, nothing happened between the two of them.  Diane admits that she spent the night in the cab, riding around, and not with Richard. Reconciled, Richard is cured of his wandering ways and Felix and Diane are reunited.','["Russell Mack"]','["A.H.

Mapes'' worried wife Jeanne (Crowley) joins him on the train, concerned about his not having had a job in more than a year. 
Tucker and his henchman Sidney (Glass) fly ahead to set up the robbery, which goes off without a hitch. John, Ray and George take the train to Chicago.  George shoots out a tire on the armored truck.  Then Sidney drives a car into the truck.  As the security guards get out to check the accident, John and Ray drive up disguised as policemen in a police car.  The three guards are tied up and the almost one million dollars is transferred into the fake police car.  The five then drive off to another site to bury their clothes, guns and other crime gear.  The money is placed into a gift box and entrusted to George.  The men continue on the train to New York.  Tucker promised the three $200,000 apiece.
However, once back on the train, Leland''s greed gets the better of him and he decides to keep all of the money for himself.  John and Ray go to talk to him but find him murdered with a suicide note left behind.  Tucker has disguised himself as a man of the cloth and is on the train.  He double crosses the trio, first eliminating Leland and Miller next, leaving Mapes as the only one left to stop Tucker from getting away with murder and keeping the entire haul.

('tt0026908','free','Rainbow Valley (1935)','1935','52min','The character, John Martin, is polite and genial. On a ride to the small town of Rainbow Valley, he runs into George, an "old-timer", who is looking for water for his car. Martin is surprised to see a car; he gives the old-timer his entire canteen of water. George, the mailman for the area, starts his car and heads down the road. Farther down, the road is being watched by highwaymen who have set up an ambush. Martin is riding on the same road and sees the highwaymen chasing George. Martin follows and takes on the highwaymen, but not before the last one shoots George. Martin leaps from his horse to the car. George is not killed; the bullet only grazed his skull. Martin hitches his horse to the back of the car and rides into town with George. 
Martin takes George to the town doctor. Meanwhile, the townspeople are rallying against the gang of highwaymen. The people of Paradise Valley are trying to build a road and modernize the town. They want to bring in "law and order" to the area, because they are tired of being abused and terrorized by the gang. They are putting together a petition to the governor of the state for legal and physical protection against the gang.
Martin walks into the Post Office and claims he beat back the highwaymen. When Martin sees a suspicious character and asks him some questions, the man starts fighting with Martin. Some of the town''s elders watching the fight. Martin accuses the suspicious character of being one of the highwaymen.
The elders say about Martin, "Say, that fellow''s a fighter! We need him around here!" The postmistress, Eleanor, thinks Martin is not a good guy, although it is obvious from his clothing and bearing that he is. George champions Martin''s character on account of his valiant struggle with the highwaymen. Meanwhile, the gang is sitting in the saloon, talking about how they messed up the ambush. They need to stop the road and keep the law out of the valley; they''re headed up by Rogers, a prominent man in town who got Eleanor her job. 
Martin figures out exactly what the gang is wanting to do—they want to send the prospectors out of business and then buy the prospectors'' land at a low price. The owner of the general store owner, Powell, thinks Martin is "the one man who won''t be intimidated by this gang", and he touts himself as an excellent judge of character and reckons that Martin measures up to his standards. 
Martin went to school for engineering, so he''s smart and capable of rebuilding the road. He''s a strategist who knows how the gang will work. He is magnetic and gets the people behind him. 
Meanwhile, the gang is strategizing on how to attack the road workers; the road workers pick up their weapons and start defending themselves against the gang. A shoot-out occurs; George uses dynamite to fend off the attackers. 
Martin returns to the Post Office, where Eleanor is friendly to Martin; she''s had a change of heart because of his friendliness, bravery, and hard work on the road. He is gentle and flirtatious but humble and virtuous. 
The highway gang is in the dark saloon, playing poker, smoking, and drinking. The gang plans to hide out along the road to kidnap George. They don''t hesitate to use physical violence, and they knock out a bystander and leave him along the road. The bystander revives and quickly rides to the road workers, where he tells Martin what happened. Martin immediately leaves and rides alone to save George. He skillfully tracks the gang to an old cabin, where he quickly sneaks into the barn and finds George tied up. George insists that they have to get the car out because it has mail in it; Martin disagrees but decides to help George. 
Mr. Rogers walks in the Post Office and leaves his wallet on the desk. The postmistress walks out with him, but he gets her to give him the key and runs back to the Post Office to steal the petition about the road. The gang substitutes a petition to release another gang member from his sentence for his crimes. They also revel in the fact that they stole all the remaining dynamite. 
Two weeks later, Martin and George wonder why they have not heard any response to the petition. 
In the gang hideout, Mr. Rogers walks in with the pardoned gang member (the boss, Butch), and the gang explains the situation to him. It happens that Martin and Butch were cellmates in jail. Butch wants to see Martin, so Mr. Rogers goes to find him. In the Post Office, Mr. Rogers tells the postmistress that Martin is an ex-convict. Martin rides into town; Rogers calls him over; the owner of the general store, Powell, sees the conversation. Martin seems happy to hear that Butch is in town. George sees Martin going into the saloon with Rogers; George goes into the Post Office, Powell follows, they assume Martin is fraternizing with Rogers and Butch. George has faith in Martin, but Powell and Eleanor assume the worst about him.
Meanwhile, Martin is talking to Butch about the road; Martin appears to be on the same side as Butch, and he agrees to destroy the road in return for a cut of the profits when the prospectors sell out. 
The townspeople gather and talk about how Martin has betrayed them. Powell issues a call to arms to kill the entire gang. George and Eleanor find a letter to George from the governor. Martin is actually an undercover agent who is trying to bust out the gang, and the letter specifies that the townspeople should cooperate and comply with Martin''s "suspicious" activities without blowing his cover. George and Eleanor realize they have to stop the mob that has just left town to stop Martin and Butch. George hitches up a couple of horses to the car to pull it like a carriage. 
Meanwhile, the mob of townspeople is getting closer and closer to the gang and Martin. Suddenly, Martin punches out Rogers, and a shoot-out begins between the townspeople and the gang. Butch is hooking up the dynamite, but Martin stops him and they begin fighting. The gang starts retreating, but Butch sets off the dynamite right on top of the gang, killing all of his men. Martin arrests Butch and shows that he was using the gang to get through the road because they had stolen all of the dynamite. 
George drives the car up to the hill and remarks on the road''s success. Finally, the road is built, runs through the hill, and is all set up for the town. In the back seat of the car, Martin and Eleanor are kissing.','["Robert N.

Michael Grayson (Johnson) reports for duty to train the 442nd, a unit established on the US mainland and composed of Nisei. His expectation was to return to the U.S. 36th Infantry Division, a Texas National Guard unit, which he had served as an enlisted soldier. He has to come to terms with a group of people that he sees as Japanese, the enemy, rather than Americans. Grayson runs his platoon rather insisting on strict observance of military regulations.
He learns that "Go for broke" is a pidgin phrase used in Hawaii meaning to gamble everything, to "shoot the works"—to risk "going broke" or bankruptcy. Grayson comes to learn the meaning of the frequently exclaimed Baka tare, which, loosely translates to mean "very stupid."
There is only one brief discussion of the internment camps from which most of the men have come, but throughout the film there are references to the camps. There are also a few brief references to the distinctions between the Nisei from Hawaii ("Buta-heads") and those from the mainland ("Katonks"). While Buta-heads (the phrase later devolved to "Buddha-Heads") are a key part of the Hawaiian economy and Hawaiian society, Katonks were largely distrusted and disliked by their neighbors.
Arriving in Italy, the unit is joined by the 100th Battalion, a Nisei unit formed in Hawaii before the 442nd. The troops of the 100th are seasoned veterans and the new arrivals look to them for advice. On the march to the front lines, Grayson gets left behind when fraternizing with a signorina, but he is not found by the colonel because his platoon has covered for him during an inspection of their positions.
By the actions by the 442nd in Italy and France, Grayson finds reason to replace his bigotry with respect toward them. His transfer to the 36th, as a liaison—over his objections—comes through when the 442nd is attached to the 36th. As he has misjudged the Nisei, they have misjudged him. The Nisei learn that he has defended them against bigotry, even getting into a fistfight with an old friend from the 36th had insulted them.
The 36th is surrounded by the German army and the "Buddha-heads''" rescue "them". On their return home, they are the awarded the distinction of the eighth Presidential Unit Citation.','["Robert Pirosh"]',NULL,'["Van Johnson","Lane Nakano","George Miki"]','["Drama","History","War"]','6.7','["tt0035958","tt0043887","tt0043459","tt0042539","tt6350786","tt0035153","tt0037547","tt0043547","tt0037522","tt0038235","tt0038160","tt0062673"]','["War; Drama; Racism; Nisei; Japanese American"]','[{"url":"/Go_for_Broke.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/Go_for_Broke_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/go_for_broke_ACM_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','go_for_broke_ACM',33920,'Q5575002','wp','["Robert Pirosh"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Five of the six airmen find each other; the sixth goes missing. The first Dutch citizens they encounter, led by English-speaking school teacher Else Meertens (Pamela Brown), are suspicious at first as no aircraft is reported to have crashed in the Netherlands (the abandoned bomber actually reaches England before hitting a pylon). After much debate and some questioning, the Dutch agree to help, despite their fear of German reprisals.
Accompanied by many of the Dutch, the disguised airmen, led by the pilots (Hugh Burden and Eric Portman), bicycle through the countryside to a football match where they are passed along to the local burgomaster (Burgemeester in Dutch, Hay Petrie). To their astonishment, they discover their missing crewman playing on one of the teams. Reunited, they hide in a truck carrying supplies to Jo de Vries (Googie Withers).
De Vries pretends to be pro-German, blaming the British for killing her husband in a bombing raid (whereas he is actually in England working as a radio announcer). She hides them in her mansion, despite the Germans being garrisoned there. Under cover of an air raid, she leads them to a rowing boat. The men row undetected to the sea, but a bridge sentry finally spots them and a shot seriously wounds the oldest man, Sir George Corbett (Godfrey Tearle). Nevertheless, they reach the North Sea. They take shelter in a German rescue buoy, where they take two shot-down enemy aviators prisoner, but not before one sends a radio message. By chance, two British boats arrive first. Because Corbett cannot be moved, they simply tow the buoy back to England. Three months later, he is fully recovered, and the crew board their new four-engine heavy bomber, a Short Stirling.',NULL,'["Emeric Pressburger","Michael Powell"]','["Godfrey Tearle","Eric Portman","Hugh Williams"]','["Action","Adventure","Drama","War"]','7.0','["tt0033627","tt0037449","tt0031968","tt0041886","tt0034734","tt0048990","tt0042432","tt0044103","tt0053023","tt0049357","tt0037439","tt0037547"]','["Action; Drama; War"]','[{"url":"/OneofOurAircraftIsMissing.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/OneofOurAircraftIsMissing_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/OneofOurAircraftIsMissing_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','OneofOurAircraftIsMissing',55158,'Q2089824','wp',NULL,'["Michael Powell","Emeric Pressburger"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

('tt0052005','free','No Time for Sergeants (1958)','1958','1h 59min','Will Stockdale (Griffith) is a backwoods rube from Georgia, who is drafted into the United States Air Force. Other draftees being transported to basic training include the dim Ben Whitledge (Nick Adams) and obnoxious bully Irving S. Blanchard (Murray Hamilton). The unhappy Whitledge wants to be assigned to the infantry where his six brothers served.
At boot camp, Stockdale proceeds to make life miserable for the man in charge, Master Sergeant Orville C. King (Myron McCormick), who likes his barracks to be quiet and calm. In exasperation, the sergeant places Stockdale on full-time latrine duty. Stockdale believes his new position of "P.L.O." (Permanent Latrine Orderly) to be a promotion. A company inspection takes a surprising turn when Stockdale''s immaculately clean latrine impresses King''s company commander. King gets into hot water, however, when Stockdale reveals that the sergeant kept him on permanent bathroom duty while neglecting to have the recruit complete all the required military exams. The company commander orders King to help Stockdale through his training in one week, or else he will be demoted and made "P. L. O." himself.
Rushing him through testing, King bribes Stockdale by promising to give him his wristwatch if he can pass. Stockdale takes a manual dexterity test from Corporal John C. Brown (Don Knotts), a psychiatric test from Maj. Royal B. Demming (James Millhollin), and an eye exam. Stockdale manages to pass despite driving all of the examiners crazy and gets the wristwatch as a reward.
Blanchard convinces King to get Stockdale drunk so that he will fail the next day''s inspection.  Stockdale, used to strong homemade whiskey, stays sober while King and Blanchard get drunk.  They begin a barroom brawl with equally drunk infantrymen, but Stockdale leaves and returns to the base, avoiding the M.P.s. Blanchard is arrested and King is missing when the colonel and captain inspect the latrine and barracks the next day. Stockdale has mechanically rigged all the toilet seats to open simultaneously in a "salute". A filthy King is found after he sneaks into the latrine and sets off the toilet lids. He is summarily reduced to private rank and sent to gunnery school along with Stockdale and Whitledge. As King goes back to his office dejected, he admits to Stockdale that he has grown to like him. Stockdale gives the watch back to King. 
At gunnery school, Stockdale is at the bottom of the class and Whitledge is next to the bottom. King graduates as the top man and is assigned to the staff of General Eugene Bush (Howard Smith) at his former rank. On their first flight, Stockdale and Whitledge fly to Denver in an obsolete B-25 bomber. Stockdale''s assignment is tail gunner. After putting the plane on autopilot, the pilots fall asleep, and the airplane becomes lost at night over the atomic bomb test site at Yucca Flats, Nevada.  The radio operator was left behind at the base, so Stockdale and Whitledge must radio to obtain their position.  Military radiomen on the ground, confused by Stockdale''s folksy, clownish speech, have the commander of the atomic bomb test rouse General Bush to confirm that Stockdale is not a prankster. Bush reassures Stockdale that he is not a foreign agent, as King tells Bush to remind Stockdale of the watch.
Following detonation of an atom bomb, a fire breaks out in the aft of the plane. Stockdale and Whitledge bail out and travel for days to get back to the base.  They are declared dead by King, but the officers survive and are to be decorated. During the air medal ceremony, Stockdale and Whitledge reappear, so the Air Force has to cover up the story to avoid an international public humiliation. Stockdale suggests both he and Whitledge be transferred to the infantry.  General Bush heartily approves and has King transferred with them.','["Mervyn LeRoy"]','["John Lee Mahin","Ira Levin"]','["Andy Griffith","Myron McCormick","Nick Adams"]','["Comedy","War"]','7.6','["tt0057776","tt0052030","tt0063591","tt0054455","tt0091846","tt0052278","tt0051519","tt0081376","tt0054453","tt0052896","tt0055074","tt0039776"]','["US Steel Hour; Public Domain; Classic TV; Andy Griffith; Kinescope; Live TV; Live Television; Comedy; Television; 1955"]','[{"url":"/No_Time_For_Sergeants_1955_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/No_Time_For_Sergeants_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','No_Time_For_Sergeants',71282,'Q2012956','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Across the street (in a house with a neon sign saying "GRANMA''S"), the Big Bad Wolf is expecting Red Riding Hood''s arrival. Instead, he receives a telegram that says Red Riding Hood will be late because she is "working at Lockheed as a rivetater." The frustrated wolf looks out the window and sees Goldilocks entering the Three Bears'' house. (Unlike the other characters, Goldilocks is drawn as an attractive young woman.) Because there is a "food shortage" going on, the wolf decides to pursue Goldilocks.
Inside the Three Bears'' house, Goldilocks tries all the beds and lies down in the best one, only to find the wolf in bed with her. The wolf chases Goldilocks through the house until the Three Bears return. Finding Goldilocks and the wolf struggling in the living room, they shout "Jitterbugs!" and begin playing a dance tune. The wolf and Goldilocks dance the jitterbug until the wolf is exhausted and flees to Grandma''s house.
Red Riding Hood returns to find the wolf in Grandma''s bed, but the wolf is too tired to eat her. So he attempts to make Red leave, claiming she came too late for their segment and his feet are sore from the dance. However The Three Bears rush in, shout "Dere''s dat jitterbug!" and resume playing. This causes Grandma to burst out of a cupboard and jitterbug with the wolf, who turns to the audience and says, in a Jimmy Durante voice, "Everybody wants to get into the act!"','["Friz Freleng"]',NULL,'["Sara Berner","Mel Blanc","Vivian Dandridge"]','[""]','6.3','["tt0036441","tt0039144","tt0035743","tt0036603","tt0029708","tt0021964","tt0033324","tt0030280","tt0028724","tt0047863","tt0116583"]','["Banned Cartoons; Vintage cartoons; Classic Cartoons"]','[{"url":"/Banned.cartoons-MerrieMelodies-GoldilocksAndTheJivinBears1944-09-24.svcd.vhs.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/GoldilocksAndTheJivinBears_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','GoldilocksAndTheJivinBears',12255,'Q5580202','wp','["Tedd Pierce"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

A recluse who hates fame, he has been away from England and has never even seen his agent. When a woman mistakenly believes he has proposed marriage to her, he and his valet Henry Leek hastily return to England. After Leek dies soon after of pneumonia, the attending doctor mistakes him for Priam and informs the press. The real Priam is glad to be mistaken for his valet by everyone, even his cousin Duncan (who has not seen him since he was 12). After several attempts to clear up the misidentification, he gives up. 
He goes to a hotel, where he meets Alice Chalice (Lillian Gish), who was put in touch with Leek through a matrimonial agency and, by chance, was to meet Leek for the first time there. Leek had sent her a photograph of him and Priam together, so she makes the same mistake. Priam finds her very pleasant to be with. He has qualms when he learns that "he" is to be accorded the great honor of being interred in Westminster Abbey, but once again he is unable to convince anyone, including Alice, that he is the painter.
He is happy to marry Alice and live a quiet country life. Then Alice''s income from brewery shares disappears, along with the brewery, but Priam assures her that he can provide for her by selling some of his paintings. She is skeptical, however. Nonetheless, she sells some of his paintings, mainly for the frames. One painting passes through several hands and ends up with Oxford, Priam''s old agent, who recognizes the artist''s style. Oxford buys all of Priam''s new paintings and resells them, guaranteeing that that are genuine Farrels.
Oxford tracks Priam down and asks him to reveal he is still alive. It turns out that one of the paintings Oxford sold had a date on it, 1932, two years after Priam''s "death", and the buyer has taken Oxford to court. Priam strenuously refuses, so Oxford takes another approach, placing an advertisement asking for information about Henry Leek.
Leek''s widow shows up, accompanied by her clergymen sons John and Henry. Her husband deserted her about 25 years before after the birth of their twin sons. She identifies Priam as him. Priam bolts at the first opportunity, but Alice is more than up to the challenge. She portrays her "Henry" as violent and not entirely sane and points out that there would be a scandal. The Leeks hastily depart.
Even so, Priam is brought into court. In the course of testimony, his cousin Duncan recalls that he has two moles on his neck. Priam stubbornly refuses to show them, but Alice convinces him to do so.

('tt0025272','free','The House of Rothschild (1934)','1934','1h 28min','In 1780 in Frankfurt, Germany, youngster Nathan Rothschild warns his parents Mayer Amschel Rothschild and Guttle that the taxman is coming. They hurry and hide their wealth, including currency, silver, etc. The taxman demands 20,000 gulden, an exorbitant sum, but accepts a bribe of 5000 in exchange for assessing 2000 in taxes. Nathan''s satisfaction is short-lived, however; a courier bringing him 10,000 gulden is intercepted and the money confiscated by the taxmen. Nathan tells his sons that he tries to be as honest as possible, but the antisemitic authorities will not let him; he admonishes his children to acquire money, for "money is power" and a defense for their people.
Later, as Mayer Rothschild is lying on his deathbed, he instructs his five sons to start banks in different countries across Europe: Amschel in Frankfurt, Salomon Mayer von Rothschild in Vienna, Nathan in London, Carl in Rome, and James in Paris. That way, they can avoid having to send gold back and forth as the need arises, for in war they are in danger of being robbed by the enemy and in peace by their own countrymen. Instead, they can draw on each other''s banks.
Thirty-two years later, the sons have established banking houses. Then France overruns Europe in the Napoleonic Wars. Austrian Prince Metternich asks Salomon to raise 15 million florins to help defeat Napoleon. The other brothers are approached with similar requests. Even in France itself, Talleyrand asks for 50 million francs. Nathan refuses to loan the British Government five million pounds (on top of previous loans) to hold off the enemy, but offers the Duke of Wellington twice that amount to smash him.
After the war is won, Wellington is disappointed to find that Nathan Rothschild has not even been invited to a party in the duke''s honour. He insists on going to see Nathan. His aide, Captain Fitzroy, knows the address, as he is in love with Nathan''s daughter, Julie, and vice versa. While there, Wellington tells Nathan that the victorious powers are going to make a very large loan to France to help it recover from the war. The winning underwriter will become the most powerful and prestigious bank in Europe.
Nathan''s bid is the best, but is rejected in favor primarily of Barings Bank. When Nathan demands to know the reason, Prussian Count Ledrantz (despite having himself sought a war loan from the Rothschilds) explains it was discarded on a "technicality", because Nathan is a Jew. Nathan surmises that the quarter of the loan not awarded to Barings will fall to Ledrantz, Metternich and Talleyrand, who stand to make enormous profits. Nathan outmanoeuvres them financially, bringing them to the brink of ruin and dishonour; they capitulate and surrender to him the entire loan. However, this has somewhat embittered him. Where once he accepted Julie''s choice, he now tells the non-Jewish Fitzroy to stay away from her.
Anti-Jewish riots break out all over Germany, instigated by Ledrantz. Nathan returns to Frankfort and, under pressure from his own people, agrees to submit to Ledrantz. However, before he can, he receives word that Napoleon has escaped from exile. Nathan''s brothers, fearful of their positions, want to support the restored French dictator. However, Nathan refuses to do so. With Ledrantz and others once again desperately in need of financial support, he extracts a treaty from them granting Jews rights, freedoms and dignity long denied them. He also tells Fitzroy that he can once again see Julie. With Napoleon seemingly invincible, Nathan determines to risk all in support of the allies. Just before he is bankrupted, he receives word that Wellington has won the Battle of Waterloo, and he is not only saved, he becomes the richest man in the world and a baron.',NULL,'["Nunnally Johnson","George Hembert Westley"]','["George Arliss","Boris Karloff","Loretta Young"]','["Biography","Drama","History","War"]','6.6','["tt0024991","tt0024865","tt0019823","tt0025301","tt0025948","tt0025124","tt0025238","tt0026643","tt0023194","tt0028216","tt0023488","tt0022074"]','["Biography;Drama;History;War"]','[{"url":"/The.House.of.Rothschild_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/the_house_of_rothschild1934.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/the_house_of_rothschild1934_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','The.House.of.Rothschild',32790,'Q1215836','wp',NULL,'["Alfred L.

However, he is persistent, and the next day she and her friend Ella reluctantly go on a double date with him and his piano player friend Harry in Balboa. In a nightclub, she expresses her distaste of trumpet music, whereupon he impresses her with his amazing prowess with the instrument. When a man tries to pick her up at the bar, he and Skid end up brawling, which lands Skid and Maggie in jail. As a result, Maggie misses her ship back to the States. 
With no money left after helping pay the fine, she is forced to move in with Skid and Harry. She talks a skeptical Murphy (a woman) into hiring the unambitious Skid and her as a trumpet player and showgirl, respectively, at "Murphy''s Cafe y Bar" by telling Murphy that they are married. She clashes with fellow showgirl Anita Alvarez, Skid''s former girlfriend, but Anita soon leaves for a better job. Maggie and Skid eventually fall in love and do marry. 
She prods the reluctant Skid into going to New York City to play in a major nightclub, leaving her behind. She finds out afterward that Anita works there. He is a big success, teamed with songstress Anita. Fame and fortune go to his head. He neglects to send Maggie the fare to join him and does not answer her letters. Finally Maggie borrows the money from Murphy. Anita intercepts her telegram to Skid, telling him where to meet her boat. After waiting at the pier for a long time, Maggie calls Anita''s hotel room on a hunch, and a drunk Skid answers (Anita invited him in for a nightcap after a night on the town together). Maggie divorces him. Ella finds out and tells her old boyfriend, wealthy rancher Harvey Howell. Mary plans to sail to France to obtain a divorce and marry Harvey. 
Skid is so devastated, he starts drinking and missing performances, costing him his job and his career. Finally, he tries to reenlist, but fails the physical exam. Then, he runs into Harry, who has been searching for him. Harry has gotten a band together for a live radio performance to audition for an important sponsor and (to help his old friend out) wants Skid to play with them. Skid''s old agent Georgie tries to get Maggie, just returned from France, to pull Skid into shape. She rushes over and does her best. During the broadcast, Skid is terrible at first, but after Maggie tells him that she is sticking to him "til death do us part", he recaptures his old brilliance.','["Mitchell Leisen"]','["Virginia Van Upp","Oscar Hammerstein II"]','["Carole Lombard","Fred MacMurray","Charles Butterworth"]','[""]','6.3','["tt0029695","tt0026452","tt0029322","tt0029588","tt0030145","tt0028138","tt0075151","tt0027908","tt0045029","tt0032220","tt0033221","tt0033150"]','["Drama; Musical; Romance"]','[{"url":"/swinghi_swinglo.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/swinghi_swinglo_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/swinghi_swinglo_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','swinghi_swinglo',44689,'Q2043516','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Singing We''re in to Win, Daffy goes over the various things Americans can send to help with the war effort. However, this doesn''t go down well with Adolf Hitler, who reads about Daffy''s scrap pile helping to beat Benito Mussolini, and responds to this by giving his men the following order: "Destroy that scrap pile!"
With the word out, a Nazi submarine fires a torpedo to the scrap pile — which has a billy goat inside, which immediately starts eating everything in sight. Daffy, hearing the noise, tries to find out what''s making the noise. After temporarily pointing a rifle at a reflection of himself (thinking that he cornered someone else), Daffy finds the goat hiccuping with the garbage inside him and amiably offers him a glass of Alka-Seltzer. However, when Daffy sees the swastika that the goat (whom he derides as a "tin termite") is wearing on his collar, he starts messing with the goat. Temporarily getting the better of the goat, Daffy is almost undone when he tries to whack the goat with a mallet - but the mallet gets stuck in the goat''s horns and the goat knocks Daffy around.
Daffy is ready to call it quits (saying "What I''d give for a can of spinach now", a direct reference to Popeye whose theatrical cartoons are now owned by WB, but at the time were a major competitor to them), but is encouraged by the ghosts of his ''ancestors'' — ducks who landed on Plymouth Rock, who encamped at Valley Forge with George Washington, who explored with Daniel Boone, who sailed with John Paul Jones, and who stood in for Abraham Lincoln. Daffy''s spirits back up when he realizes, "Americans don''t give up, and I''m an American... duck!", and then he turns into "Super American" in a reference to Superman (whose owner, DC Comics, is now a WB subsidiary itself). Daffy flies after the goat, knocking him around. The goat makes a run for the submarine, but Daffy repels all bullets shot at him and starts yanking on the periscope. Just then, the scene changes to Daffy yanking on a fire hose and getting hosed down. Daffy wakes up, thinking it was all just a dream — until he looks up at the Nazi submarine sitting on top of the scrap pile, where the Nazis tell Daffy, "Next time you dream, include us

('tt0182766','free','The Battle of Britain (1943)','1943','54min','The narrator describes the fall of France, leaving Britain almost defenceless. British forces are vastly outnumbered, but the British people are calm. The narrator explains that this is because in a democracy the people as a whole are involved in the decision to fight. Hitler''s masterplan to subjugate Britain is described. Hitler begins by attacking convoys and ports, but fails to destroy them. The RAF are outnumbered "6 - 8 - 10 to one", but knock out far more planes than the Germans do. Bailed out British pilots are also able to return to the air, but German pilots are lost. Unlike the Dutch and Polish airforce Britain does not "make the mistake of bunching its planes on the runways".
Losses force Hitler to "take time out". He tells Goering to change tactics, so the Luftwaffe attack factories. Britain deploys "improved listening posts" to identify coming attacks. In August and September German losses are far more severe. However the "German mind" cannot understand why "free people fight on against overwhelming odds". The Nazis now aim to "crush the British spirit" by attacking London, destroying homes, hospitals and churches. But the people adapt and survive. Enraged, Goering takes personal command, sending a massive attack on September 15, to which the British respond with "everything they had". In the battle the Germans suffer severe losses.
Despite many losses, and destruction of historic buildings, the Germans cannot break Britain. They switch to night attacks, hoping to terrorise the people and make them "cry for mercy", then die of begging.. But the people show great resilience. The British also counter-attack, bombing key German factories. Hitler takes revenge by destroying Coventry.

Among the passengers are Alfred Davidson, a self-righteous missionary, his wife, and Sadie Thompson, a prostitute. Thompson passes the time partying and drinking with the American Marines stationed on the island. Sergeant Tim O''Hara, nicknamed by Sadie as "Handsome", falls in love with her.
Her wild behavior soon becomes more than the Davidsons can stand and Mr. Davidson confronts Sadie, resolving to save her soul.  When she dismisses his offer, Davidson has the Governor order her deported to San Francisco, California, where she is wanted for an unspecified crime (for which she says she was framed). She begs Davidson to allow her to remain on the island a few more days – her plan is to flee to Sydney, Australia. During a heated argument with Davidson, she experiences a religious conversion and agrees to return to San Francisco and the jail sentence awaiting her there.
The evening before she is to leave, Sergeant O''Hara asks Sadie to marry him and offers to hide her until the Sydney boat sails, but she refuses. Later, while native drums beat, the repressed Davidson rapes Sadie. The next morning he is found dead on the beach – a suicide. Davidson''s hypocrisy and betrayal cause Thompson to return to her old self and she goes off to Sydney with O''Hara to start a new life.','["Lewis Milestone"]','["John Colton","Clemence Randolph"]','["Joan Crawford","Walter Huston","Fred Howard"]','["Drama"]','6.9','["tt0022276","tt0025740","tt0023926","tt0021228","tt0030413","tt0025132","tt0022059","tt0034399","tt0026787","tt0042544","tt0019237","tt0019344"]','["drama; South Seas"]','[{"url":"/Rain.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Rain_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/rain1932_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','rain1932',65336,'Q2127904','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

('tt0029811','free','Young and Innocent (1937)','1937','1h 20min','On a stormy night, at a retreat on the English coast, Christine Clay (Pamela Carme), a successful actress, argues passionately with her jealous ex-husband Guy (George Curzon). Not accepting her Reno divorce as valid, he accuses her of having an affair. Finally, she slaps him and he leaves the room. While they had been arguing, his eyes twitched violently; they continue to do so when, once outside, he turns angrily to look at the closed door behind him.
The next morning, Robert Tisdall (Derrick De Marney) happens to be walking along the seaside when Christine''s dead body washes ashore. He recognizes her, and runs for help. Two young women arrive just in time to see him racing away from the corpse. The police quickly decide that Tisdall is the only suspect. Christine was strangled with the belt from a raincoat; his raincoat is missing and he says it was recently stolen. He admits knowing the victim from three years ago when he sold her a story, but the authorities assume the two have been having an affair. When they learn that she has left him money in her will (unknown to him), they feel they have hit upon motive and Tisdall is arrested.
Scotland Yard detectives grill him all night. The next morning, he faints and is revived with the aid of Erica Burgoyne (Nova Pilbeam), daughter of the local police Chief Constable. Tisdall is assigned an incompetent barrister, and is taken into court for his formal arraignment. Doubting if his innocence will ever be established, he takes advantage of overcrowding in the courthouse to escape, wearing the barrister''s eyeglasses as a disguise. He gets away by riding on the running board of Erica''s Morris car, revealing himself to her after the car runs out of petrol.
He helps push the car to a filling station, pays for petrol, and convinces her to give him a ride. Though she is initially fearful and unsure about her passenger, Erica eventually becomes convinced of his innocence and chooses to help him in any way that she can. They are eventually spotted together, forcing both to stay on the run from the police. Tisdall tries to prove his innocence by tracking down the stolen coat: if it still has its belt, the one found next to Christine''s body must not be his.
The duo succeed in tracing Tisdall''s coat to Old Will (Edward Rigby), a homeless, but sociable, china-mender. But Will was not the thief; he was given the coat by a man with twitchy eyes. And when Will received the coat, its belt was missing.
Separated from the group, Erica is taken in by the police. Upon realizing that his daughter has fully allied herself with a murder suspect (in fact, she and Tisdall are in love), her father chooses to resign his position as Chief Constable rather than arrest her for assisting a felon. Tisdall sneaks into their house to see her, intending to surrender next, but she mentions that the coat had a box of matches from the Grand Hotel in a pocket. Tisdall has never been there: perhaps the murderer has a connection to the hotel.
Erica and Will go to the hotel together, hoping to find him. In a memorably long, continuous sequence, the camera pans right from their entrance to the hotel and then moves forward from the very back of the hotel ballroom, finally focusing in extreme closeup on the drummer in a dance band performing in blackface. His eyes are twitching. He is Guy.
Recognizing Old Will in the audience, and seeing policemen nearby (actually they have followed Will in the hopes of finding Tisdall), Guy performs poorly due to fear. He is berated by the conductor and, during a break, takes medicine to try to control the twitching, but it makes him very sleepy. Eventually, in mid-performance, Guy passes out, drawing the attention of Erica and the police. Immediately after being revived and confronted, he confesses his crime and begins laughing hysterically.
Erica then tells her father that she thinks it is time they invited Tisdall to their home for dinner.','["Alfred Hitchcock"]','["Josephine Tey","Charles Bennett"]','["Nova Pilbeam","Derrick De Marney","Percy Marmont"]','["Crime","Mystery","Romance","Thriller"]','6.9','["tt0028231","tt0028212","tt0031505","tt0025452","tt0023285","tt0032484","tt0033922","tt0022395","tt0023395","tt0021165","tt0042994","tt0039694"]','["Crime; Drama; Thriller; Alfred Hitchcock"]','[{"url":"/Young_and_Innocent.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Young_and_Innocent_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/YoungandInnocentTheGirlWasYoung_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','YoungandInnocentTheGirlWasYoung',194998,'Q498983','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

When found to be made of a material unknown on Earth, the spool is circumstantially linked to the Tunguska explosion of 1908. The spool is seized on as evidence that the explosion, originally blamed on a meteor, was actually caused by an alien spaceship.
Professor Harringway deduces the craft must have come from Venus. The spool itself is determined to be a flight recorder and is partially decoded by an international team of scientists led by Professor Sikarna and Dr. Tchen Yu. When radio greetings sent to Venus go unanswered, Harringway announces that a journey to Venus is the only alternative. The recently completed Soviet spaceship Cosmostrator, intended to voyage to Mars, is redirected to Venus, a 30- to 31-day journey. During the voyage, Sikarna works furiously to translate the alien message using the spaceship''s computer.
When their spaceship nears Venus, radio interference from the planet cuts the crew off from Earth. By then, Sikarna''s efforts lead to a stunning discovery: The spool describes a Venusian plan to irradiate the Earth''s surface, with the extermination of mankind being the prelude to an invasion. Rather than containing a "cosmic document", as had been expected, the spool bears a cold-blooded message of destruction. Harringway convinces the crew to press on towards Venus rather than return to Earth with news that would panic mankind.
With the ship''s robot, Omega, American astronaut Brinkman pilots a one-man landing craft. On the ground, he encounters an industrial complex and finds small recording devices that look like insects. The rest of the crew follows when Cosmostrator lands, but they find no Venusian life forms. Journeying across the planet, they find the remains of a deserted and blasted city centered around a huge crater, signs of a catastrophic explosion so intense that shadowy forms of humanoid Venusians are permanently burned on to the walls of the surviving buildings.
The Venusians are gone, but their machines remain functioning, including the radiation-bombardment machine intended for Earth. One of the scientists accidentally triggers the weapon, leading to a frantic effort by the Earthmen to disarm it. Tchen Yu lowers Talua, the ship''s communication officer, into the Venusian command center. When Tchen Yu''s suit is punctured, Brinkman ventures out to save him. Before he can reach Yu, Talua succeeds in reversing the weapon. Unfortunately, this also reverses Venus'' gravitational field, flinging Cosmostrator into space. Brinkman is also repelled off the planet, beyond the reach of the spaceship, while Talua and Tchen Yu remain marooned on Venus. The surviving crew members must return to Earth, where they warn humanity about the dangers of atomic weapons.','["Kurt Maetzig"]','["Stanislaw Lem","Jan Fethke"]','["Yôko Tani","Oldrich Lukes","Ignacy Machowski"]','["Sci-Fi"]','4.5','["tt0042897","tt0122111","tt0049900","tt0059887","tt0043545","tt0045073","tt0056352","tt0053072","tt0062360","tt0056127","tt0053388","tt0047577"]','["Sci-Fi"]','[{"url":"/First_Spaceship_on_Venus.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/First_Spaceship_on_Venus_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/First_Spaceship_on_Venus_ipod.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/First_Spaceship_on_Venus_ipod_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/the_first_spaceship_on_venus_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','the_first_spaceship_on_venus',49507,'Q535628','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Gurko suppresses the clergy and the free press and imprisons the Prime Minister Baron Von Neuhoff (Montagu Love).  The rightful ruler of the Grand Duchy, the Grand Duchess Zona (Joan Bennett), hopes to get aid from Napoleon III of France and makes her escape pursued by a troop of Hussars loyal to Gurko. While on a hunting trip, the visiting Count of Monte Cristo (Louis Hayward), rescues her.  The Count escorts the Grand Duchess Zona to a neutral country, but Gurko''s Hussars violate international neutrality to return the Grand Duchess and her lady-in-waiting back to Lichtenburg.

He befriends the loyal Lt. Dorner (Clayton Moore) of the palace guard who knows a variety of secret passages leading from the Grand Ducal Palace to the literal catacombs of the Grand Duchy. 
Discovering that Baron Von Neuhoff is to be executed, the Count gains entry to the palace through his previously being asked for a large loan of French Francs by Gurko and plays the role of a cowardly fopish international banker.  There he overhears Gurko meeting with the French Ambassador (Georges Renavent) who raises the issue of human rights in the Grand Duchy.

That night, he sneaks into the palace of the caliph using a magic rope he stole during ritual prayers. All thoughts of plunder are forgotten when he sees the sleeping princess, the caliph''s daughter. The princess''s Mongol slave discovers him and alerts the guards, but he gets away.
When his associate Abu reminds the disconsolate Ahmed that a bygone thief once stole another princess during the reign of Haroun al-Rashid, Ahmed sets out to do the same. The next day is the princess''s birthday. Three princes arrive, seeking her hand in marriage (and the future inheritance of the city). Another of the princess''s slaves foretells that she will marry the man who first touches a rose-tree in her garden. The princess watches anxiously as first the glowering Prince of the Indies, then the obese Prince of Persia (an uncredited Mathilde Comont), and finally the Prince of the Mongols pass by the rose-tree. The mere sight of the Mongol fills the princess with fear, but when Ahmed appears (disguised in stolen garments as a suitor), she is delighted. The Mongol slave tells her countryman of the prophecy, but before he can touch the rose-tree, Ahmed''s startled horse tosses its rider into it.
That night, following ancient custom, the princess chooses Ahmed for her husband. Out of love, Ahmed gives up his plan to abduct her and confesses all to her in private. The Mongol prince learns from his spy, the princess''s Mongol slave, that Ahmed is a common thief and informs the caliph. Ahmed is lashed mercilessly, and the caliph orders he be torn apart by a giant ape, but the princess has the guards bribed to let him go.
When the caliph insists she select another husband, her loyal slave advises her to delay. She asks that the princes each bring her a gift after "seven moons"; she will marry the one who brings her the rarest. In despair, Ahmed turns to the holy man. He tells the thief to become a prince, revealing to him the peril-fraught path to a great treasure.
The Prince of the Indies obtains a magic crystal ball from the eye of a giant idol, which shows whatever he wants to see, while the Persian prince buys a flying carpet. The Mongol prince leaves behind his henchman, telling him to organize the soldiers he will send to Bagdad disguised as porters. (The potentate has sought all along to take the city; the beautiful princess is only an added incentive.) After he lays his hands on a magic apple which has the power to cure anything, even death, he sends word to the Mongol slave to poison the princess. After many adventures, Ahmed gains a cloak of invisibility and a small chest of magic powder which turns into whatever he wishes when he sprinkles it. He races back to the city.
The three princes meet as agreed at a caravansary before returning to Bagdad. The Mongol asks the Indian to check whether the princess has waited for them. They discover that she is near death, and ride the flying carpet to reach her. Then the Mongol uses the apple to cure her. The suitors argue over which gift is rarest, but the princess points out that without any one gift, the remaining two would have been useless in saving her life.  Her loyal slave shows her Ahmed in the crystal ball, so the princess convinces her father to deliberate carefully on his future son-in-law. The Mongol prince chooses not to wait, unleashing his secret army that night and capturing Bagdad.
Ahmed arrives at the city gate, shut and manned by Mongols. When he conjures up a large army with his powder, the Mongol soldiers flee. The Mongol prince is about to have one of his men kill him when the Mongol slave suggests he escape with the princess on the flying carpet. Ahmed liberates the city and rescues the princess, using his cloak of invisibility to get through the Mongols guarding their prince. In gratitude, the caliph gives his daughter to him in marriage.','["Raoul Walsh"]','["Lotta Woods","Douglas Fairbanks"]','["Douglas Fairbanks","Julanne Johnston","Snitz Edwards"]','[""]','7.8','["tt0033152","tt0013556","tt0054013","tt0018051","tt0019421","tt0015224","tt0018742","tt0015841","tt0011984","tt0019412","tt0015864","tt0023243"]','["fairbanks; bagdad; flying carpet;"]','[{"url":"/ThiefOfBagdad1924_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/ThiefofBagdad1924_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','ThiefOfBagdad1924',73561,'Q1192927','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
('tt0042249','free','The Big Lift (1950)','1950','2h','Off-duty American airmen of the 19th Troop Carrier Squadron in Hawaii are ordered to report to their squadron in July 1948. What is briefed as a temporary "training assignment" in the United States becomes a flight halfway around the world to Germany for the C-54 Skymasters of the 19th, where the Soviets have blockaded Berlin in an attempt to force out the Allies by starving the city. Tech Sgt. Danny MacCullough (Montgomery Clift), flight engineer of a C-54 nicknamed The White Hibiscus, is immediately ordered to fly with his crew from Frankfurt into Tempelhof Airport to deliver a load of coal. His friend Master Sgt. Hank Kowalski (Paul Douglas), a ground-controlled approach (GCA) operator, hitches a ride with them to his new station. Hank, a POW during World War II, resents the German people and goes out of his way to be rude and overbearing to them. Danny on the other hand is frustrated at being restricted to the airport because of the necessity of quickly offloading and returning to Frankfurt.
Months later, the crew of "Big Easy 37" (a call sign, airlift shorthand for an eastbound C-54) rename their airplane Der Schwarze (The Black) Hibiscus because of the grimy soot that has accumulated in it from hauling coal. They become temporary celebrities on a mission when they are the 100,000th flight of "Operation Vittles" into Berlin. Danny is immediately enamored of Frederica Burkhardt (Cornell Borchers), an attractive German war widow chosen to thank him on behalf of the women of Berlin. When a news correspondent covering the ceremony recruits Danny for a public relations stunt, Danny jumps at the opportunity as a means of getting a pass in Berlin and seeing Frederica again. During a tour of the city, Danny''s uniform is accidentally covered with poster paste, forcing him to wear civilian working clothes until it is cleaned. They meet Hank and his "Schatzi", the friendly and intelligent Gerda, at a night club, where Hank is rude to Frederica and treats Gerda as an inferior. Hank chances to see the former prison guard who tortured him as a POW, and beats him nearly to death. Danny is able to stop Hank only by knocking him down.  Mistaken for a German attacking Hank, he is chased into the Soviet occupation zone by military police.
Danny and Frederica narrowly escape back into the American zone, where Hank is waiting for them at Frederica''s apartment and has unexpectedly befriended her neighbor and Danny''s friend, Herr Stieber (O.E. Hasse), a self-professed Soviet spy. Danny falls in love with Frederica, despite learning from Hank that she lied to him about the backgrounds of her dead husband and father. When Danny receives notice that he is due to rotate back to the United States soon, he arranges to marry Frederica. However, Herr Stieber suspects duplicity in Frederica and intercepts a letter she has written to her German lover living in the United States, revealing that she intends to divorce Danny back in the U.S. as soon as she legally can, and see her lover behind his back until that happens.
In the meantime, Hank, in trying to teach Gerda the meaning of democracy (and now deeply ashamed of the beating he inflicted on the former guard), comes to see that he has been hypocritical in his own actions toward Germans. He begins treating Gerda as an equal and with affection as they meet Frederica to be witnesses to the wedding. When Danny arrives, he tells Frederica she will have to wait a long time, if ever, to get to America. Herr Stieber has given Danny the letter she wrote. Gerda says she prefers to stay in Germany and do her small part in helping rebuild the country, and Hank reveals to Danny that he is not going home but has switched his temporary assignment in Berlin to permanent duty. Danny''s flight out departs, amidst rumors that the Russians will soon end the blockade.','["George Seaton"]',NULL,'["Montgomery Clift","Paul Douglas","Cornell Borchers"]','["Drama","War"]','6.5','["tt0040765","tt0053017","tt0046366","tt0050882","tt0052415","tt0060295","tt0035612","tt0037547","tt0054476","tt0043924","tt0041452","tt0043041"]','["cold war; Berlin; Montgomery Clift; Paul Douglas; Cornell Borchers; C-54; Operation Vittles"]','[{"url":"/TheBigLift1950.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/TheBigLift1950_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/TheBigLift1950complete_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','TheBigLift1950complete',12743,'Q495924','wp','["George Seaton"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

It was not until 1945 Disney was able to pay off his $1.2 million war film deficit. After Disney''s main distributor at the time RKO Radio Pictures refused to release the film in theaters, Walt decided to have United Artists (the distributor of many of his shorts between 1932 and 1937) release it instead, making it the first and only Disney animated feature to be released by a different movie studio.',NULL,'["Alexander de Seversky","Perce Pearce"]','["Alexander de Seversky","Art Baker","Billy Mitchell"]','["Documentary","Animation","History","War"]','6.6','["tt0035120","tt0015532","tt1785394","tt0045963","tt0168184","tt0476680","tt0046807","tt0035575","tt1059955","tt0037515","tt0108432","tt0020697"]','["WWII","World War II","Air Power -- United States -- History -- 20th Century","World War, 1939-1945 -- United States -- Caricatures and cartoons","De Seversky, Alexander P.

He is met by two physical manifestations of his personality — the classic "good angel on one shoulder, bad devil on the other shoulder" dilemma common to cartoons of the time — identified as the "thrifty saver" and the "spendthrift."
The "good duck" appears as a slightly elderly duck with a Scottish accent who wears a kilt and Scottish cap and urges Donald to be thrifty with his money so he can be sure to pay his taxes for the war effort.  The "bad duck" appears as a zoot suit-wearing hipster who urges Donald to spend his duly earned money on idle pleasures such as "good dates". The good angel reminds of other "dates": the dates when his taxes are due.  The narrator explains that Americans should "gladly and proudly" pay their income taxes which are higher that year "thanks to Hitler and Hirohito."

A tug-of-war ensues between "spend" and "save" with Donald caught in the middle. Eventually the two sides give way and crash on opposite ends of Donald to reveal the "true" selves: the doors of the bad duck''s club are revealed to be swastikas and the bad duck himself turns out to bear a resemblance to Hitler (his bow tie is now a swastika and he has grown Hitler''s characteristic mustache), while the wall the good duck has crashed up against resembles the flag of the United States. The narrator then asks the audience if they are going to "spend for the Axis" or "save for taxes". Having made the seemingly obvious choice, Donald is assumed to  shake hands with the bad duck, but it is revealed that he heads over to the bad duck to punch him out at the last second.  He then goes to proudly pay his taxes with the good duck.
The second part of the film is a montage entirely recycled from The New Spirit, showing how the taxes are being used to make planes, bombs, ships, and other war materials. It then shows them being used against Axis forces, along with the repeated slogan "Taxes... to (bury, sink, etc.) the Axis", accompanied by the opening bars of Beethoven''s Fifth Symphony (the "V for Victory" theme).','["Jack King"]','["Carl Barks","Joe Grant"]',NULL,'[""]','5.3','[]','["Donald Duck; Walt Disney; Short; Animation; Propaganda; World War 2"]','[{"url":"/TheSpiritOf43_56_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/The_Spirit_of__43_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','TheSpiritOf43_56',103088,'Q1992011','wp',NULL,NULL,'["Clarence Nash"]',NULL,NULL,NULL),

McLeod suspects a security leak and feels the wife is under better protection out of CIA hands. Connors accepts the job and suggests posing as a newlywed couple at a local hotel.
Connors meets the wife, Mrs. Ashanti, at the hotel and informs her of the ruse to which she''s initially reluctant to participate in until Connors assures her it''s for appearances only and doesn''t have any inappropriate intentions towards her. Ashanti complains of a sore back, prompting Connors to call for a masseuse to come to their room.
Later, Connors observes the masseuse at the window gesturing to a man on the sidewalk, raising his suspicions of her and prompting him to watch her perform her work even at the protest of Wanda and the masseuse. He turns out to be correct in his suspicions, as in a moment when he is out of the room the masseuse prepares a syringe. Connors enters the room in time, and the masseuse hastily hides the syringe back in her pocket. The masseuse leaves without incident and Connors orders some well-done New York strip steaks and J&B scotch from room service. While waiting for their room service to arrive, Connors explains to Mrs. Ashanti that he is from Harlem and that he learned how to be a detective in Harlem. He left, however, because there were too many detectives in Harlem. Mrs. Ashanti also mentions spending time in Harlem and thought it was a fantastic place.
Room service arrives and without provocation Connors knocks out the room service deliverer (who was a man dressed as a woman), claiming he can "smell a New York Strip steak a block away" and then reveals a gun hidden under the cover of one of the room service trays. Soon two more men enter the room; thugs working for a local crime kingpin "Big Daddy", who Connor quickly dispatches using his fighting and martial arts skills. Connors holds the gun to one the thug''s head and makes him confess who sent him, and the thug reveals the name of the person who sent him is Big Daddy. Connors deems the hotel to be unsafe and leaves with Ashanti to a safer location.
The safer location turns out to be the apartment of Connor''s current girlfriend, who is initially reluctant to leave but soon does so without objection. Ashanti continues to complain about her sore back and Connors offers to help her with his own massage knowledge eventually leading to he and Ashanti consummating their relationship on the bed of apartment''s tenant. Presumably the next day, Connors safely delivers Ashanti back into the hands of the CIA and her husband, the head of state of an African nation.
On return to his office Connors expresses his intentions to have a "goof-off day" to his secretary but the intentions are soon dashed with the entrance of another potential client, this one being Harry De Bauld and small entourage of thugs. De Bauld is the leader of a local criminal organization and recently his daughter, Wanda, has been kidnapped by a rival gang, ran by a man known only as "Big Daddy." Connors questions De Bauld about the mysterious Big Daddy, to which De Bauld can only provide a few details: Big Daddy is known for never pulling any of his own stunts, and physically, he has large muscles, and wears large bands around his muscles. A money/hostage exchange is set to occur and De Bauld loudly wishes Connors to exploit that exchange in order to recover his daughter, to carry it out Connors is given a large sum of cash for his services as well as a large amount of cocaine, his end of the hostage exchange.
Connors meets with one of Big Daddy''s men in a local gym to set up the details of the exchange, but Connors uses that as a ruse to follow the man to the hide-out where they are holding Wanda. After taking out several of the men guarding the location as well as the man running the compound Connors is able to recover Wanda and he takes her with him to a safe hiding place.
The hiding place, once again, turns out to be his girlfriend''s home whom he has to eject, this time at her great annoyance. Wanda and Connors talk some, Wanda revealing she''s not happy with her father whose criminal activities had recently grown more intense with the involvement of drug trafficking. Wanda and Connors consummate their relationship on the bed of the apartment''s tenant.
The following day, Connors delivers Wanda back into the hands of her father in his office but refuses to return the drugs trying to convince De Bauld to drop that aspect of his organization in order to repair the relationship with his daughter. Connors also wishes to meet with Big Daddy in order to put a stop to his activities once and for all.
Connors and Big Daddy meet later to discuss their differences. Big Daddy tries to enlist Connors into his organization, but Connors refuses and the two fight. Connors is able to quickly defeat and kill Big Daddy and then leaves in the arms of Wanda, who had arrived with her brother to observe the fight and potentially aid Connors.','["Rene Martinez Jr."]',NULL,'["Loye Hawkins","Cathy Davis","Patricia Fulton"]','["Action"]','2.3','["tt0074715","tt0080370","tt0099577","tt0071512","tt0072245","tt0074210","tt0072286","tt0069322","tt0086141","tt0212458","tt0070639","tt0105900"]','["Action; Drama"]','[{"url":"/TheGuyFromHarlem.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/TheGuyFromHarlem_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/TheGuyFromHarlem_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','TheGuyFromHarlem',17250,'Q7738563','wp','["Gardenia Martinez"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

She goes to the party with her friends, they all drink alcohol, only the girls at the party smoke marijuana unknowingly, and keep on laughing. Burma and her boyfriend have sex on the beach while her friends go skinny-dipping.
One of the girls drowns at the skinny-dipping party and the rest of the friends must keep the details of the party a secret. When Burma tells her boyfriend she is pregnant (from their beach encounter), she pressures him to marry her. He says everything will be fine and turns to the strangers who threw the party for a job to support his family-to-be. The stranger gives him a job unloading smuggled drugs from a secret shipment to the docks. The police find out about this shipment, chase the smugglers, and shoot and kill Burma''s boyfriend.
After Burma finds out about this news, she runs away from home, is forced to give her child up for adoption, and becomes a drug dealer. Burma moves on to harder drugs injecting heroin into herself. In the film''s ending, Burma hatches a plan to kidnap and ransom her sister''s adopted daughter for $50,000, but she later finds out that the child is, in fact, her own.','["Dwain Esper"]',NULL,'["Harley Wood","Hugh McArthur","Pat Carlyle"]','["Crime","Drama"]','4.0','["tt0028346","tt0028589","tt0025465","tt0147467","tt0029989","tt0121587","tt0041865","tt0022286","tt0121377","tt0046416","tt0028074","tt0204454"]','["Crime; Drama"]','[{"url":"/Marihuana-the_Devils_Weed_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/Marihuana.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Marihuana_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','Marihuana-the_Devils_Weed',68099,'Q3847942','wp','["Hildegarde Stadie"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

When asked to speak in his own defense, he pauses, and reflects to say; "I accuse my parents" for not giving him the home life he should have had.
The film then flashes back to a day in high school, when Jim was given an award for an essay describing the ideal home he supposedly has. Eager to tell his parents, he goes home to a house full of empty liquor bottles, and parents distracted by arguing with each other. Jimmy is embarrassed when his mother (Vivienne Osbourne) shows up drunk to the graduation planning committee. Later, his father (John Miljan) gives him money instead of celebrating his birthday with him.
Jim gets a job selling shoes after school and meets torch singer Kitty Reed (Mary Beth Hughes). He delivers a pair of shoes to her house and then meets her later at the nightclub where she works. The two begin dating, Jim unaware that Kitty is also the moll of gangster Charles Blake (George Meeker), who specializes in fencing stolen jewelry. Blake identifies Jimmy as sufficiently gullible and recruits him to deliver packages and messages after work and school. Jim gets paid highly for his errands, so he never questions what exactly he is delivering.
Charles forces Kitty to break up with Jimmy after he realizes their relationship is becoming serious. Shortly afterward, Jim drives two of Charlie''s henchmen to a late-night "errand," which turns out to be a robbery in which a night watchman is shot. Realizing what he''s gotten himself involved with, Jimmy turns to his father, who rebuffs him. Jimmy confronts Blake himself, but Blake threatens to kill him if he does not continue working for him. After the police identify Jimmy as the driver of the getaway car, Blake sends his men to kill Jimmy, but the execution is interrupted, when two passersby happen upon the scene, causing the men to flee and leave behind a beaten Jimmy.
Fearing for his life, Jimmy packs a suitcase and spends an indeterminate amount of time hitchhiking and train-hopping. He ends up in a small town where he attempts to rob a diner, but the kindly owner, Al (George Lloyd), recognizes Jimmy as a good boy in a bad situation, and offers him safe harbor and a job, as long as he agrees to give up crime and start going to church. After a period of living and working for Al, Jimmy''s life straightens up and he confesses to his crimes. Al agrees to accompany Jimmy back home to turn himself in.
Back in Jimmy''s hometown, Al takes him to confront Kitty, who confesses that she was forced to break up with him. Jimmy then goes to confront Blake one more time, in the hopes that Blake will also turn himself in to help clear Jimmy''s name. Blake refuses and instead pulls a gun on Jimmy; Jimmy attempts to wrestle the gun away, accidentally shooting and killing Blake in the process. The police, alerted by Al, storm Blake''s hideout and arrest his men, along with Jimmy.
Back in the present, the judge, understanding why Jimmy accuses his parents, acquits Jimmy of manslaughter. However, the judge also finds him guilty on charges of possession of stolen property, gives him a five-year suspended sentence and two years'' probation and remands him to the custody of his parents until he is twenty-one. The judge then addresses Jimmy''s parents (and the camera), warning that any young man could suffer the same fate as Jimmy if left to neglectful parents.
The film concludes with a title card informing the audience that the production company is paying all costs to send the film overseas to entertain troops fighting World War II.','["Sam Newfield"]','["Arthur Caesar","Harry L.

The victim was going to testify before a grand jury against a gangster. Since Frank saw the shooter, Police Inspector Ferris (Robert Keith) wants to place him in protective custody so he can testify. Frank has second thoughts and slips away. Ferris speaks to Frank''s wife, Eleanor (Ann Sheridan). She comments, "Just like him, always running away." Ferris asks her, "Running away from what?" She replies, "From everything." She is not especially cooperative or concerned about her husband.
Eleanor later tries to sneak out without being spotted by the police and encounters reporter Danny Legget (Dennis O''Keefe). He offers help and $1000 for an exclusive story. Sam, a friend, passes along a message that Frank will send her a letter addressed to his co-worker Maibus. 
When Eleanor returns to her apartment, Ferris informs her that he has spoken with Frank''s doctor. He is taking medicine for a bad heart, a condition she was unaware of. Ferris has instructed all druggists to notify him if someone asks for it. Eleanor gets some from his doctor.
Frank''s letter is intercepted by Legget, who gains Eleanor''s trust. The letter gives cryptic instructions on where Frank is. They speak to Sam again; his friend Suzie mentions to Legget that Frank made a sketch that looks like him. Legget later returns, gets the drawing and tears it up; Suzie dies from a fall from a building.
During the course of her investigation, Eleanor learns things she never knew about Frank, including that he still loves her. She begins to question herself, her feelings for him and how she treated him.
Once Eleanor figures out Frank''s riddle, she and Legget go to a beachside amusement park at night. Ferris follows them there. Then Ferris receives a phone call from Sam, who tells him that the only thing missing from Suzie''s possessions is Frank''s drawing. When Eleanor finds Frank, she reconciles with him. She then goes to find Legget. When they spot Ferris, they get on the roller coaster to avoid being spotted. Legget has Eleanor stay on the roller coaster, while he goes to meet Frank. She suddenly realizes that Legget is the killer (he remarked that Frank was shot at, a detail known only to her, the police and the gunman), but she is trapped on the ride. Leggett tries to induce a heart attack in Frank. The two fight and shots ring out. Eleanor runs to the scene to discover that Ferris has shot the corrupt reporter.

Directing his message to District Attorney Ray Willis (John Dehner), he reveals that he anticipates being murdered within an hour, and begins to tell his story in extended flashbacks.
The memories begin with him explaining to his war buddy and best friend Joe Leeds (Dick Foran) that he is having an affair with Leeds'' wife Myra (Angela Lansbury), who wants a divorce. Joe asks Craig to give him a little time to think the matter over. Days later at his own office, Joe finishes writing a letter and gives it to his business partner Lou Kazarian to mail. Joe phones Myra telling her he will be home soon to discuss something. There, he confronts Myra in their bedroom, where a door is closed and a gunshot is heard. Police investigate Joe''s death. Myra explains that Joe became irate and threatened her physically, forcing her to shoot him in self-defense. Craig is also on the scene, having arrived before the police and acting as Myra''s lawyer.
In the ensuing trial, DA Willis allows the police to present their evidence that a physical struggle did not occur as she''d said. Willis notes that Myra was not employed when she first met Joe, a successful businessman with a good amount of life insurance. In her defense, Craig attributes Myra''s inconsistencies regarding the night in question as post-traumatic hysteria.  In his closing argument, Craig claims the money motive in Willis'' case is not valid because Myra was in love with another man — a revelation that could inspire Joe to cause Myra premeditated harm. Craig then reveals that he himself is Myra''s lover.

The jury finds Myra not guilty. She and Craig throw a party to celebrate with friends. When Lou arrives, he reveals privately to Craig that he had forgotten to mail Joe''s letter, which was addressed to Craig. Joe discloses in the letter that Myra did indeed marry him for his money, but that she was actually in love with an artist, not with Craig. Joe had decided to ask her to stay married, in part to save Craig from her. Craig then remembers Myra mentioning that an "old friend", an artist named Carl Holt, had visited her in jail during the trial.
Craig goes to see Holt, who explains his long relationship with Myra, interrupted by her marriage to Joe, and states his gratitude and admiration for Craig in his defense work in Myra''s trial, especially his posing as Myra''s lover as a tactic. Craig later confronts Myra with Joe''s letter and his talk with Holt. She admits that she does intend to go on with Holt now she is free.
Accusing her of costing him his best friend, the love of his life and his profession all at once, Craig tells Myra she will pay for her crime regardless, because he will force her to murder him. Myra is incredulous, but Craig soon puts a plan in motion, developing a friendship with Holt, even employing him to paint a portrait to delay Myra and Holt''s departure to Europe to marry. All the while, Craig taunts Myra that he will reveal all the evidence to Holt and let him decide if he wants to marry a murderess. As well, Craig meets socially with DA Willis, discussing Myra''s case, and lets Myra see them together.
Craig concludes his story being dictated into the tape recorder by saying he has arranged to meet Myra at the office at 12:30 am, which soon arrives. Hearing a knock at the office door, Craig leaves the recorder running and hides the microphone behind a desk photo of himself and Joe, then lets in Myra. He shows her the file he says is full of evidence he''s compiled against her, and then sets down the pistol on the desk.
As he starts to make a phone call to Holt, Myra, successfully driven to desperation, takes the gun and shoots Craig, who falls to the floor. Using a handkerchief, she hangs up the phone and wipes her fingerprints from the gun, which she puts in Craig''s hand. She finds the file is full of nothing but blank sheets of paper. When DA Willis arrives, she explains that Craig has shot himself. After checking that Craig is in fact dead, Willis learns that Myra had an appointment with Craig for 12:30, then tells her Craig had invited him to come at 12:40. He finds the microphone and recorder, then stops and rewinds the tape. As he begins to play Craig''s recording, Myra starts crying, defeated.','["Peter Godfrey"]','["Al C.

The next day, Miller discovers the Chinaman''s body which was carried in with the tide, and takes it as evidence to his editor, who still remains skeptical of Kirk''s guilt. To get conclusive evidence, Miller tells him he plans to romance Kirk''s daughter Julie in order to break the smuggling operation.
When Kirk returns, he informs Julie that they will need to move on soon—maybe to Singapore—as soon as he can put together enough money for the voyage. One night, Julie discovers her father drunk at a boarding house. Miller, who was there investigating Kirk, helps Julie take her father home. Julie does not discourage Miller''s flirtations, and during the next few weeks they fall in love. She is able to help Miller see the beauty of the waterfront, and inspires him to improve the novel he''s been working for the past five years. While visiting an old Spanish galleon on a date, he playfully restrains her in a torture rack and kisses her passionately—and she returns his passion.
Julie and Miller spend a romantic evening together on the beach, where she reveals that she and her father will be sailing away in the next few days. After spending the night in Miller''s apartment, Julie announces the next morning that she''s decided to stay, hoping that he will stay with her. When Miller learns from her that her father is due to dock at the Chinese settlement that night, he notifies the Coast Guard. At the dock, while the Coast Guard searches the vessel, Miller discovers a Chinaman hidden inside a large shark. When the Coast Guard attempt to arrest Kirk, he flees the scene but is wounded during his escape.
The next morning, Miller''s breaking story is published on the Standard''s front page. When a wounded Kirk makes his way back home, Julie learns that it was Miller who helped the Coast Guard uncover her father''s smuggling operation (of which she was unaware), and that she unknowingly revealed to him his landing location. Soon after, Miller, feeling guilty over the story''s impact to Julie''s life, arrives at her home and apologizes for the hurt he''s caused her, and announces that he loves her. Feeling used by his actions, an angry Julie sends him away. Later that night, Miller locates Kirk, who shoots him in the arm. Julie arrives to help her father escape, and seeing Miller wounded, she tells her father she cannot leave Miller to die. Seeing that she loves him, Kirk helps her take Miller to safety, after which Kirk dies. Later from his hospital bed, Miller acknowledges in his newspaper column that Kirk saved his life before he died. Sometime later, Miller returns to his apartment, where Julie is waiting to greet him. Noticing that she cleaned and transformed his place into a cozy home, he tells her he finally wrote the ending to his novel, "He marries the girl". Julie acknowledges, "That''s a swell finish", and the two embrace.','["James Cruze"]','["Max Miller","Wells Root"]','["Ben Lyon","Claudette Colbert","Ernest Torrence"]','[""]','6.3','["tt0028231","tt0025134","tt0045053","tt0036367","tt0030554","tt0024727","tt0045564","tt0040474","tt0024593","tt0034399","tt0038873","tt0023642"]','["Romance; Smuggling; Reporter"]','[{"url":"/I_Cover_the_Waterfront.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/I_Cover_the_Waterfront_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/I_Cover_the_Waterfront_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','I_Cover_the_Waterfront',13405,'Q2053145','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Attempting to catch a shark by throwing it bait that has been tied to a harpoon-sized hook, Johnny Baker (Joel McCrea) accidentally steps into a loop that tightens around his ankle. The shark takes the bait, and the rope grows tighter, causing the rope to yank the young man overboard. Luana (Dolores del Río), the daughter of the chief, saves his life by leaping into the water and cutting the rope.

Tarlock (Richard Gaines), a fitness fanatic and publisher of the picture magazine Flick, tells his editor, Larry Burke (Chester Morris), to hire Pat Marvin (Nancy Kelly), a small town Iowa photographer, based on a great photograph of a crashing airplane. After Tarlock leaves, Larry fires a photographer for faking a picture. It turns out that Pat''s boyfriend, Ben Scribner (Phillip Terry), faked her airplane picture. Pat is very excited about the job offer. Ben is less enthused about her leaving for the big city, but supports her decision to take the job.
Larry is pleased to discover that his new employee is an attractive woman and takes her out to dinner. Pat seizes an opportunity by taking photographs of Dolores Tucker (Jane Farrar), the wife of much-married millionaire Sonny Tucker (Charles Arnt), laying on the floor of the restaurant''s ladies'' room after a suicide attempt. For a followup, Pat disguises herself as a chorus girl to gain entrance to Sonny''s apartment. Dolores walks in shortly afterward and becomes very jealous. Pat has to knock her out with a punch to get away, taking pictures of Dolores and Sonny before and after.
Pat invents a brother named Ben to fend off Larry''s amorous advances. To Pat''s surprise, the real Ben follows her to New York. When Larry walks in on them, Pat introduces her "brother". Ben reluctantly goes along with the deception. He decides to stay in New York, and talks Larry into giving him a job.
Meanwhile, Sonny asks Pat to marry him, after he divorces Dolores. Dolores makes a scene when she finds them together at a nightclub.
Larry finally finds out about Ben and does not believe Pat when she says she was going to tell him. In anger, he sends Ben on an assignment, one that (unbeknownst to him) puts him aboard a ship bound for Russia. Meanwhile, Tarlock assigns Pat to take a series of photographs of a fake murder for the magazine''s readers to try to solve. However, the photo of Pat, as the "victim", looks just like a real police photo of the dead Dolores, slumped face down on a couch. Pat is indicted for murder. Larry tries to get Ben back to corroborate Pat''s story, but learns that Ben was not among the survivors when his ship was torpedoed. Larry proves that Dolores was killed by Sonny. Afterward, Larry breaks up with Pat, guilt-ridden over Ben''s death. Then Ben shows up and punches him.

The next shot includes the face of the woman, Tarantella (Tandra Quinn). A brief kiss between her and the man, ends with his lifeless body falling down. A disembodied voice asks the audience "Have you ever been kissed by a girl like this?" The narrative properly begins in a desert. A narrator (Lyle Talbot) mocks the overblown ego of humanity, a race of puny bipeds which claims to own planet Earth and every living thing on it. Yet, they are outnumbered by the insects, and the Hexapods are likely to survive longer than humans. The narrator then claims that when men or women venture off "the well beaten path of civilization" and deal with the unknown, the price of their survival is the loss of their sanity.During this narration, the film introduces its protagonists Grant Phillips (Robert Knapp) and Doreen Culbertson (Paula Hill). The narrator explains that the two of them are lost in the "great Mexican desert", the "Muerto desert". They are nearly dead from dehydration and sunburn when discovered by an American surveyor and his Mexican companion. These characters are identified as Frank (John Martin) and Pepe (Chrispin Martin). The two victims of the desert recover their senses in "Amer-Exico Field Hospital", somewhere in Mexico. Grant starts narrating his story to Doc Tucker (Allan Nixon), foreman Dan Mulcahey (Richard Travis), and Pepe.The film flash-backs to events occurring a year earlier in Zarpa Mesa. Famous scientist Leland Masterson (Harmon Stevens) arrives, having accepted an invitation from a fellow scientist named Dr. Aranya (Jackie Coogan). Aranya (name derived from the Spanish araña for spider) has reportedly penned "brilliant" scientific treatises, and Masterson looks forward to meeting him in person. Masterson is genuinely intrigued by Aranya''s theories, but his host informs Masterson that his work is not theoretical. He has already completed successful experiments, creating both human-sized tarantula spiders and human women with the abilities and instincts of spiders. His creation Tarantella has regenerative abilities, sufficient to regrow severed limbs. He seriously expects her to have a lifespan of several centuries. His experiments have had less success in male humans, who simply turn to disfigured dwarfs.Masterson is horrified and denounces Aranya and his creations, proclaiming that they should be destroyed. In response, Aranya has him injected with a drug, turning him into a doddering simpleton. The front page of a newspaper called Southwest Journal explains that Masterson was eventually found wandering in the desert. He was declared insane and placed in an asylum. Some time later, Masterson escapes the "Muerto State Asylum". He is next seen two days later, in an unnamed American town of the Mexico–United States border. Also present there are Tarantella, businessman Jan van Croft (Nico Lek), and his fiancée Doreen. They were heading to Mexico for their wedding day, but their private airplane had engine problems and stranded them there. Jan''s servant Wu (Samuel Wu) is seen exchanging glances with Tarantella. It serves as the first sign that he is working with her.Masterson is tracked to the bar by his nurse at the asylum, George (George Barrows, the "monster" in "Robot Monster"). The entire bar and its patrons observe Tarantella perform an energetic dance. Masterson apparently recognizes her, pulls a handgun, and shoots her. He then takes Jan, Doreen, and George hostage. He heads for Jan''s private airplane and he forces pilot Grant to prepare for takeoff, despite the pilot''s protests that only one engine is fully functional. The airplane departs with Doreen, George, Grant, Jan, Masterson, and Wu aboard it. Meanwhile, Tarantella regenerates following her apparent death, and leaves the bar.In mid-flight, Grant discovers that someone sabotaged the gyrocompass, resulting in them flying towards the wrong direction for most of the flight. Wu''s facial expression allows the audience to learn who was the saboteur. The airplane crash-lands atop Zarpa Mesa, where the creations of Aranya were expecting them. For a while being, the creations simply observe them from afar. The film follows the activities of the stranded group for quite a while. There is sexual tension between Grant and Doreen, culminating in a passionate kiss. Meanwhile, the group dwindles with the deaths of first George, secondly Wu, and lastly Jan. Wu is confirmed to have served as an agent of Aranya, but one who outlived his usefulness.The last three members of the group are then captured. Grant soon recognizes that their captor''s name is identical to the Spanish term for "spider", "araña". Aranya cures Masterson from drug-induced imbecility, hoping to recruit him. This backfires as Masterson uses his intellect in a suicide attack. He allows Doreen and Grant to escape, then sets up an explosion which kills himself and everyone else. The flashback ends and we return to the hospital. He fails to convince anyone but Pepe of the truth in his story. Yet the finale reveals that at least one of Aranya''s spider-women has survived.',NULL,NULL,'["Jackie Coogan","Allan Nixon","Richard Travis"]','["Horror","Sci-Fi"]','2.7','["tt0052969","tt0042855","tt0051418","tt0053944","tt0052394","tt0050720","tt0051064","tt0047507","tt0062946","tt0054673","tt0046186","tt0044167"]','["Sci-Fi; Jackie Coogan"]','[{"url":"/MesaOfLostWomen.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/MesaOfLostWomen_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/MesaOfLostWomen_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','MesaOfLostWomen',77164,'Q12126156','wp','["Herbert Tevos"]','["Ron Ormond","Herbert Tevos"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

B. Fleming (Roger Pryor) comes up with a plan to catch the Nazis. He believes that radio signals are alerting the Germans about ship movements. His plan is to fire all the local radio specialists, who likely will seek any employment, including working with the enemy. Tailing the jobless radio men will help the FBI find the Nazis.
Engineer Lewis J. "Lew" Deerhold (Richard Arlen) thinks he lost his job because he is a Canadian citizen. Lew looks after his niece Tina (Patsy Nash), a war orphan requiring a brain operation. Needing money, he applies for work at a radio repair shop, where he meets Ann Patterson (Wendy Barrie), the victim of a purse snatching. Lew recovers her purse and asks Ann out on a date.
After coming back to his apartment, his new boss is there with Dr. Arthur Huneker (Nils Asther) and his assistant Vincent Bela (Marc Lawrence).  Lew is offered a job by Huneker, a Nazi spy commander who needs someone to repair a top-secret stolen radio transmitter. Ann is an FBI agent who has been assigned to follow Lew. She finds blueprints to the transmitter in Lew''s possession. When FBI agent Freddie Grayson (Ralph Sanford) searches Lew''s apartment, he is shot but is able to tell Lew that the doctor has the stolen transmitter and shot him.
Lew confronts Huneker, who is meeting with Japanese Commander Toyo (Abner Biberman). The pair try to convince Lew to join the Nazi party; he pretends to go along. When they begin to torture the owner of the Bambridge shipping company (John Miljan), their new recruit is ordered to kill Bambridge, who is actually Captain Hargas, an American agent. Instead, Lew escapes, taking with him the codes for the transmitter.
At the doctor''s hot springs resort, Lew and Ann join forces, but are captured and locked in a steam room by Huneker. Before they are killed by the steam, Lew devises a transmitter and sends an SOS that is picked up by a young boy whose father calls the FBI. FBI agents rush to save Lew and Ann, and arrest Huneker and his men. Agent Fleming also contacts a bomber squadron that destroys the Japanese submarine laying in wait off the California coast. With his niece Tina recovered from her operation, and Ann in attendance, Lew, now a private in the US Army, is granted American citizenship.','["Frank McDonald"]',NULL,'["Richard Arlen","Wendy Barrie","Nils Asther"]','["Thriller","War"]','5.5','["tt0036398","tt0035755","tt0036161","tt0035614","tt0034637","tt0036430","tt0061693","tt0023973","tt0031147","tt0040106","tt0044085","tt0089763"]','["WWII; Thriller"]','[{"url":"/submarine_alert.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/submarine_alert_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/submarine_alert_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','submarine_alert',59164,'Q7631574','wp','["Maxwell Shane"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Hoping to utilize their horse-riding skills, they decide to start a stage coach transportation business. They go to Buchanan City and ask local magnate Cal Drake (Douglas Cosgrove) if he is willing to sell them a stage coach. Instead, Drake offers them a franchise from his own stage coach line - a line out to bustling Crescent City.
Upon arriving at Crescent City, Blair and Adams quickly realize that they had been bamboozled into paying for the line as Crescent City is a ghost town. The only residents are the mayor, Rocky O''Brien (Lew Kelly), and Dr. William Forsythe (Sam Flint). The mayor is thrilled to get not only new residents to double the size of the town, but a stage coach line too.  Blair disparages as there are no customers to transport and will have to lose his business so quickly. The mayor says there is a way for Blair to get all the money he owes and more.  There will be a contest in the next few days where the fastest team in a race will win a $25,000 government contract to deliver mail to the area. With Blair''s luck returning, he also meets a telegraph crew, who he saves from poisoning after drinking from a local water hole. In appreciation, the telegraph crew offers to run the line through Crescent City if Blair will give them laborers to build the telegraph line.
Blair is able to get laborers to build the telegraph line and the population of Crescent City begins to skyrocket. Drake, upset that Blair is actually a competing business out of his lie, then decides to hire Blair to drive a gold shipment to Sacramento only to ambush him. If Blair can get the gold to the destination, Drake will take $1,000 off of the original loan. Blair escapes the ambush and collects the money at gunpoint. Drake next hopes to stop Blair at the race.  He gets his henchman to throw obstacles in Blair''s way to defeat him by any means necessary. But despite all odds, Blair wins the race and the $25,000 reward.','["Mack V. Wright"]','["Joseph F. Poland","Joseph F.

He appears to be in town investigating a string of robberies committed by the Polka Dot Bandit (Yakima Canutt), but when he is a little late in discovering one of the Bandit''s latest thefts, Sheriff Jake (George "Gabby" Hayes) thinks he is the thief. For some reason, instead of arresting him, Jake accompanies him on his journey; after all, as Wayne says, "It''s kind of lonesome trailing alone." 
The two stumble upon a gang robbing a pack-mule train; they rescue Betty Mason (Eleanor Hunt), whose father has just been killed by the bandits. She and her father were bringing desperately needed provisions to town, but the bandits have successfully cut off any supplies, forcing the townspeople to consider fleeing their homes or starving to death.
It turns out that the local rich man, with the meaningful name of Malgrove (Edward Peil Sr.), is behind the robberies. He knows there''s a vein of gold underneath the homesteaders'' property, and he offers out of the kindness of his heart to purchase their land for a pittance. B-movie bad guys have a tendency to crow about their evil plans without checking to see if anyone is hiding nearby, and when the grieving Betty overhears his plans, Malgrove and his henchmen kidnap her. Carruthers and Jake offer to make one last attempt to bring supplies in, and Malgrove and his henchmen make plans to murder them.','["Robert N. Bradbury"]','["Robert N. Bradbury","Robert N.

She travels to Akbar, India with Greg’s father, Colonel Jones (John Miljan), who also narrates the film, together with Wayne Monroe (Keith Richards) and the Professor (Wilson Benge). She asks about Jones at the front desk of the hotel where she stays.  Although the clerk acts like he knows nothing of Jones, he immediately makes a suspicious phone call when the group leaves the lobby.
While Jean unpacks in her room, a native woman named Tondra (Vida Aldana), who spied on the group in the hotel lobby earlier, knocks on the door.  She tells Jean that her husband, Moya (Hassam Kayyam), spoke to her of a safari that suffered a tiger attack.  Jean asks Tondra to speak to her husband.  Although apprehensive to get her husband at first, she quickly fetches her husband when Jean greases her palm.  Tondra returns with Moya, who recognizes Jones from a photo of Jean’s.  He tells Jean that Jones traveled not with the doomed safari but with a group of ivory hunters that went to Africa.  Before Moya can say more, someone shoots him with a pistol through Jean’s room window.  The shooting upsets the unstable locals and the group leaves for Africa.
They take a boat deep into the African jungle where they see abundant wildlife.  Jean must convince Gary Lambert (Robert Lowery), who hates taking women on safaris, to be their guide.  She knocks his socks off with her shooting skills with a gun.  They also pick up famed safari cook, Gabby (J.

The rescue mission meets with turmoil and death from an unknown saboteur among their ranks. A native man tells the group rumors of a group of white she-devils in the jungle that make their native guides skittish.  The women came from a lifeboat from a shipwreck many years ago.

Borneo was strategically important to Japan as it is located on the main sea routes between Java, Sumatra, Malaya and Celebes. Control of these routes was vital to securing the territory. Japan needed an assured supply, particularly of oil, in order to achieve its long-term goal of becoming the major power in the Pacific region.
Worried about the rumours surrounding Japanese invasion in 1941, Harry suggests that Agnes move back to the United States along with George. Agnes refuses and she and George remain.
The Imperial Japanese Army invade Borneo and intern the small British community in a camp on Pulau Berhala island off Sandakan. Later they are sent to the notorious Batu Lintang camp near Kuching, Sarawak,where the men and women are separated.
During the Japanese invasion of Sandakan, Agnes has a miscarriage.
These camps are under the charge of Colonel Suga (Sessue Hayakawa). Col. Suga is fluent in English and has read a book on Borneo written by Mrs. Keith. He treats Agnes well.
When Col. Suga visits Agnes at Batu Lintang camp and asks her to autograph a copy of her book as she had agreed to back in the earlier camp. Agnes signs the book with a personal message.
The camp guards are cruel and oppressive, as seen when they shoot down a group of Australian men who try to cross the wire fencing during a bit of flirtation with the women.
One night a Japanese guard attacks Agnes in an attempted rape when she runs outside in the night to bring in the washing being blown around in the strong winds. Later she complains to Col. Suga, who asks Lieutenant Nekata to investigate. Unfortunately Agnes is not able to identify her assailant as it was too dark. Nekata insists she identify the assailant by presenting her with a written statement for her to sign. She refuses to do so as she is aware that to make an unsubstantiated accusation against any Japanese soldier is punishable by death. In an effort to get her to sign the statement while Col. Suga is away she is tortured by Nekata''s junior officers (after he has left the room, to avoid being a witness to the beating) and threatened with further torture if she says anything to anyone. In great pain she tries to keep her injuries from her fellow captives. Eventually she agrees to withdraw her allegation.
In September 1945 Japan surrenders and Agnes learns from Col. Suga that he has lost all his family at the end of the war. They used to live in Tokyo but his wife was so fearful that they moved to Hiroshima where she thought they would be safer.
At the end, Allied troops arrive at the camp abandoned by the Japanese and the Keith family finally reunites.','["Jean Negulesco"]','["Nunnally Johnson","Agnes Newton Keith"]','["Claudette Colbert","Patric Knowles","Florence Desmond"]','["Drama","War"]','7.3','["tt3129564","tt0036367","tt3462892","tt0039757","tt0031602","tt0034012","tt0043121","tt0039349","tt8661880","tt6258766","tt0040153","tt0045877"]','["WW II; Japanese prison camp:Claudette Colbert; Sessue Hayakawa; Jean Negulesco; war"]','[{"url":"/ThreeCameHomeClaudetteColbertHankrip.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/ThreeCameHomeClaudetteColbertHankrip_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/ThreeCameHomeClaudetteColbertHankrip_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','ThreeCameHomeClaudetteColbertHankrip',70696,'Q1257224','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The scene opens with Charlie bent double over the side of the ship, appearing to be seasick. Then it is revealed he is only fishing.
Much humour is derived from the heavy sway of the boat, with much sliding around the deck.
Charlie, among other things, plays cards, eats in the mess hall, and avoids seasick passengers. Along the way, he befriends another unnamed immigrant (Purviance) who is traveling to America with her ailing mother. The two have been robbed by a pickpocket who then loses the money to the Tramp in a card game. The Tramp, feeling sorry for the two penniless women, attempts to secretly place his winnings from his card game in the woman''s pocket, but ends up being mistakenly accused of being a pickpocket. The woman manages to clear the Tramp''s name. Upon arrival in America, the passengers all stare at the Statue of Liberty but once landed the Tramp and the woman part company.
Later, hungry and broke, the tramp finds a coin on the street outside a restaurant and pockets it. He doesn''t realize there is a hole in his pocket and the coin has fallen straight through and is back on the ground. He enters the restaurant, where he orders a plate of beans, at first eating one bean at a time. There, he is reunited with the woman and discovers her mother is dead. The Tramp orders a second bowl of beans, for her.
As they eat, they watch the restaurant''s burly head waiter (Campbell) and other waiters attack and forcibly eject a patron who is short 10 cents in paying his bill. The Tramp, intimidated by the waiter, checks and now realizes he has lost his coin. Terrified of facing the same treatment as the man he saw thrown out, the Tramp begins planning how he will fight the huge man. However, a stranger enters, flaunting the coin he found outside. When the head waiter takes the coin it also falls from his pocket onto the floor. The Tramp then makes many failed attempts to retrieve it without notice. He finally retrieves the coin and nonchalantly pays the waiter only to be thunderstruck when the waiter reveals the coin to be fake. Once again, the Tramp prepares for the fight of his life. Just then, a visiting artist spots the Tramp and the woman and offers them a job to pose for a painting. The two agree. The artist offers to pay for the Tramp and the woman''s meal, but the Tramp declines the offer several times for reasons of etiquette, intending to eventually accept the artist''s offer; however, he''s dismayed when the artist does not renew his offer to pay at the last moment. The artist pays for his own meal and leaves a tip for the waiter. The Tramp notices that the tip is enough to cover the couple''s meal and, without the artist noticing, palms the tip and presents it to the waiter as his own payment for his and the woman''s meal. As a final riposte, he lets the waiter keep the remaining change - one small coin - after paying his bill. The waiter thinks the artist himself has given no tip whatsoever, and is clearly upset at this supposed action.
Afterwards, outside a marriage license office in the rain, the Tramp proposes marriage to the woman, who is coy and reluctant until the Tramp physically carries her into the office while she waves her arms and kicks her feet in protest.','["Charles Chaplin"]',NULL,'["Charles Chaplin","Edna Purviance","Eric Campbell"]','[""]','7.7','["tt0007880","tt0007832","tt0007613","tt0007264","tt0007507","tt0007162","tt0009018","tt0006414","tt0006684","tt0006689","tt0006177","tt0006548"]','["Charlie Chaplin; Silents"]','[{"url":"/CC_1917_06_17_TheImmigrant_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/CC_1917_06_17_TheImmigrant_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','CC_1917_06_17_TheImmigrant',172950,'Q1070468','wp','["Charles Chaplin"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The money is now gone. They take him to headquarters. He reveals the letter came from “the Panther” and is now believed as others have had letters from the same character and Digberry meets a group of them. They all got typewritten letters demanding a thousand dollars too but unlike him they consulted the police. The group all turn out to be connected (Digberry makes wigs). Baritone, Enrico Lombardi looks to be a possible candidate so the Commissioner orders him brought in.
Lombardi tries to force himself on Nina Politza and hits Digberry who intervenes, for bringing him into this affair. Nina is reported as sailing on a ship to Buenos Aires, as planned. Digberry receives a call and goes out. While out, the police are let into his apartment and try his typewriter to see if the “H” matches that on the Panther''s letters and if his cat''s inked paw is the same mark as on the letters. They are in both cases.
Digberry returns and is taken to headquarters. Digberry now tells the Commissioner he wrote the letter to blackmail himself to cover up from his wife and five (grown up) daughters the thousand dollars he drew out of his account but refuses to say what it was for. Meanwhile, a woman has been found murdered in his apartment block and next to her is a signed picture of Digberry. Investigation reveals that the dead woman, wearing a gray wig, is Nina. Digberry''s unlikely alibi is that he was waiting on a street corner as per a phone call he had received.
Orders go out to pick up Nina''s ex-husband and Lombardi and the Commissioner follows up a wig lead Digberry gave him, about gray hair found from an inferior wig to the kind Digberry makes. The wig maker, Wilkins tells him it could be from a wig he made for Galloway or for Lombardi. Captain Walters (Captain because he served in France in WWI) who managed Nina, offers a thousand dollar reward for the capture of her murderer. A report is given that Lombardi is out of town and no such person as Galloway or the address given the wig maker exists.
Wilkins is to be at the police station next morning to see if he can recognise who bought the second gray wig from a list of suspects. Lombardi is finally caught, and has a gun with one shot fired. That night, Wilkins is shot and killed to stop him identifying a possible murderer. Digberry''s apartment is searched and a missing insurance policy found, signed over to him, worth $20,000. The murder weapon, put in one of his drawers by an unseen person is found too.
Digberry returns and explains to the Commissioner that he loaned her the thousand dollars because though everyone thought she was well off, she was broke. She signed the insurance over to him as surety. She could not afford to go away as before, so got off the ship before it sailed and planned to stay in town in disguise (the wig, etc.) as the knowledge that she had no money could have hurt her career. Digberry is off to headquarters again where the Commissioner finally reveals all and the villain is taken away to jail.

Chingachgook (Theodore Lorch) sends his son Uncas (Roscoe), the last living warrior of the Mohican tribe, to warn the fort''s commander, Colonel Munro (James Gordon), of the imminent danger. Uncas is admired by Munro''s daughter Cora (Barbara Bedford), much to the displeasure of her suitor, Captain Randolph (George Hackathorne).
Upon receiving Munro''s plea for assistance, General Webb (Sydney Deane) dispatches a relief force of 3000 men to Fort William Henry with the Munro sisters, but with the aid of an Indian runner named Magua (Beery), the sisters and Major Heyward (Henry Woodward) take a shortcut through the wilderness.  Magua, who is a Huron sympathizer, then pretends to lose his way.  In the forest they encounter Uncas, Chingachgook and the hunter and scout Hawkeye (Harry Lorraine), accompanied by an eccentric preacher named David Gamut (Nelson McDowell).  When Heyward asks for directions to Fort Edward, the men become suspicious of Magua who, like all Indians in the area, should have an intimate knowledge of the terrain. Their fears of treachery are confirmed when they discover that Magua has disappeared.
Uncas and Hawkeye conceal Heyward and the women in a cave, but Magua and his men find the hiding place, and after a fierce firefight the women are captured.  Magua offers to spare "Golden Hair" (Alice) if Cora will become his squaw; but Uncas, Chingachgook and Hawkeye counterattack and rescue the hostages.  Although they leave Magua for dead, he is actually uninjured.
The hostages and their rescuers arrive at Fort William Henry at the same time as the column of troops, but the situation is still dire. The only thing keeping the besiegers at bay is a formidable gun emplacement on the left rampart.  The cowardly Captain Randolph informs Montcalm, the French commander, that the rampart guns are nonfunctional, leaving Munro no choice but to surrender the fort.  Though promised safe passage for the women and children, the Hurons, under the influence of French-supplied whiskey, slaughter the civilians and torch the fort.
Magua kidnaps the Munro sisters for a second time and flees.  Uncas and Hawkeye pursue him, but Magua reaches a neutral Delaware village.  The dispute is taken before a Delaware council of three; their judgment is that Cora be released to Uncas, and that Alice remain with Magua.  To save her sister, Cora offers to take her place.  Uncas vows that Magua will not leave with his true love; but by Delaware law, Magua is protected until sundown.
That night, Cora escapes and is pursued by Magua to the edge of a precipice.  She threatens to jump if he approaches, so Magua waits patiently for her to fall asleep. When she does, he grabs her arm. She flings herself off the cliff, but Magua still has hold of her arms. When Uncas appears, the situation is reversed: Cora tries to save herself, but Magua uses his knife to pry her fingers loose, and she falls to her death. In the ensuing fight, Magua stabs Uncas, whose body rolls down the embankment to rest near Cora''s. With his final, dying strength, Uncas reaches forth and takes Cora''s hand in his.  Magua flees when Chingachgook and Hawkeye arrive, but Hawkeye shoots him dead.
At Cora and Uncas''s burial ceremony, Munro becries the passing of his daughter and Chingachgook mourns for his son, the last of the Mohicans.',NULL,'["James Fenimore Cooper","Robert Dillon"]','["Wallace Beery","Barbara Bedford","Alan Roscoe"]','[""]','6.7','["tt0027869","tt0066678","tt0023119","tt0011439","tt0012190","tt0011130","tt0010844","tt0008891","tt0050026","tt0020030","tt0011565","tt0076300"]',NULL,'[{"url":"/Last_of_the_Mohicans.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Last_of_the_Mohicans_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/PublicdomainTheLastoftheMohicans_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','PublicdomainTheLastoftheMohicans',61131,'Q444242','wp',NULL,'["Clarence Brown","Maurice Tourneur"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

('tt0034891','free','In Which We Serve (1942)','1942','1h 54min','The film opens with the narration: "This is the story of a ship" and the images of shipbuilding in a British dockyard. The action then moves forward in time showing the ship, HMS Torrin, engaging German transports in a night-time engagement during the Battle of Crete in 1941. However, when dawn breaks, the destroyer comes under aerial attack from German bombers.
Eventually the destroyer receives a critical hit following a low-level pass. The crew abandons ship as it rapidly capsizes. Some of the officers and ratings manage to find a Carley float as the survivors are intermittently strafed by passing German planes. From here, the story is told in flashback using the memories of the men on the float. The first person to reveal his thoughts is Captain Kinross (Coward), who recalls the summer of 1939 when the Royal Naval destroyer HMS Torrin is being rushed into commission as the possibility of war becomes a near certainty.
The ship spends a relatively quiet Christmas in the north of Scotland during the Phoney War. But by 1940, the Torrin is taking part in a naval battle off the coast of Norway. During the action, a terrified young sailor (Richard Attenborough in his first acting role) leaves his station while another rating (Mills) returns to work his gun after its crew is knocked unconscious by a torpedo strike. The damaged Torrin is towed back to port, all the time being harried by dive bombers.
Safely back in harbour, Captain Kinross tells the assembled ship''s company that during the battle nearly all the crew performed as he would expect; however, one man didn''t. But he tells everyone present they may be surprised to know that he let him off with a caution as he feels that, as Captain, he failed to make him understand his duty.
Returning to the present, the float survivors watch the capsized Torrin take on water as the badly damaged ship slowly sinks. The raft is again strafed by German planes. Some men are killed, and "Shorty" Blake (Mills) is wounded. This leads to a flashback in which Blake remembers how he met his wife-to-be, Freda, on a train while on leave. It is also revealed that she is related to the Torrin''s affable Chief Petty Officer Hardy (Miles). When both men return to sea, Freda moves in with CPO Hardy''s wife and mother-in-law.
The Torrin participates in the Dunkirk evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force, (portrayed in the film by the 5th Battalion of the Coldstream Guards). Meanwhile, the nightly Blitz takes its toll on British towns. Blake soon gets a letter from home to say that Freda has given birth to his son during one raid, but that Hardy''s wife and mother-in-law were killed in the same attack. Stoically he goes to the Petty Officers'' Mess to tell Hardy, who is writing a letter home, the bad news.
The flashback ends as the survivors on the life raft watch the capsized Torrin finally sink. Captain Kinross leads a final "three cheers" for the Torrin when suddenly another passing German plane rakes the raft with machine gun fire, killing and wounding more men. A British destroyer soon appears and begins rescuing the men. On board, Captain Kinross talks to the survivors and collects addresses from the dying. He tells the young man who once deserted his post that he will write and tell his parents that they can be proud that he did his duty; the critically injured young man smiles and dies peacefully.
Captain Kinross and the ninety surviving members of the crew are taken to Alexandria in Egypt,
whence they send brief telegrams to their loved ones, who had heard of the ship''s sinking, to let them know they have survived.
Wearing a mixture of odd clothing and standing in a military depot, Captain Kinross tells them that although they lost their ship and many friends, who now "lie together in fifteen hundred fathoms", he notes that these losses should inspire them to fight even harder in the battles to come. The ship''s company is then told they are to be broken up and sent as replacements to other ships that have lost men. Captain Kinross then shakes hands with all the ratings as they leave the depot. When the last man goes, the emotionally tired captain turns to his remaining officers, silently acknowledging them before walking away.
An epilogue then concludes: bigger and stronger ships are being launched to avenge the Torrin; Britain is an island nation with a proud, indefatigable people; Captain Kinross is now in command of a battleship.

While no comment is made as to where this Alice comes from or what time the film is set in, Alice seems to be American, as she likes cheeseburgers and is having a great deal of trouble when it comes to getting to France. As Alice points out, “Getting to Wonderland was easy – all I had to do was fall down the rabbit hole. But let’s face it – it takes money to get to Paris!”.
As Alice dreams in her bedroom, a talking mouse named François rides a bicycle into Alice''s bedroom and wants to conduct a survey about her favourite cheeses.  Alice wants to join François in his native Paris, so François uses a cheese that his company makes, which uses the same magical mushroom she ate in Wonderland as an ingredient, to shrink Alice to rodent size.  Together, they ride through Paris, where François narrates a series of short stories with a Parisian theme.

Lila''s father, Charlie Miller (H. B. Warner), owns the dude ranch where Ken and Cactus intend to enter their prize horse Tarzan in a gruelling canyon race. Two other men, Chandler and Tracy, have also arrived for the race. They are also plotting to blackmail Charlie, who has a secret criminal past, for half of his gold mine and ranch operation earnings. Chandler also hopes that his blackmail scheme will force Charlie into granting him permission to marry Lila, who is showing a definite interest in Ken. Charlie refuses to be bullied, however, and claims he was innocent of the crime.
Before the race, Chandler and Tracy trick the gambling-prone Cactus into a wager in which Tarzan will be the prize if Ken loses the race. To assure their victory, Tracy sets up a trip-wire on the course, which injures Tarzan and allows Tracy to win the race. After he discovers the broken wire and suspects foul play, Ken refuses to give up his horse to Chandler. Shamed by his foolish behavior, Cactus vows to identify the saboteur, whose boot prints he discovers in the ground near the wire.
Meanwhile, Tracy double-crosses Chandler by robbing the ranch stagecoach carrying a shipment of Charlie''s gold. During the robbery, the driver is killed. Ken, who is trying to catch the bandits, is jailed for the crime after Tracy implicates him to the sheriff. With the help of Cactus and Tarzan, Ken escapes from jail and arrives at the ranch just as Chandler shoots Tracy. Again, Ken is suspected of the killing. After Cactus arrives with proof that Tracy''s boots match the prints found on the racecourse, Ken tricks Chandler into a confession by claiming he possesses a damning note left by Tracy.
The sheriff reveals to Chandler that Charlie came to him about the blackmail attempt and that, unknown to Chandler, whose real name is Monte Korber, Charlie had been pardoned of the earlier crime years before.

They are given a copy of Mein Kampf by the judge as a reward for their service to Hitler; their passport contains spaces for 12 more children (a hint that the couple is expected to produce a large family for the Fatherland).
This is followed by the only extended comical section of the cartoon, the tone of which is very light compared to the rest of the film. The audience is told that as Hans grows up, he hears a distorted version of Sleeping Beauty depicting Hitler as the knightly prince character rescuing an obese Valkyrie representing Germany, from a wicked witch representing democracy. (The narrator sarcastically comments that "the moral of this story seems to be that Hitler got Germany on her feet, climbed onto the saddle, and took her for a ride.") Thanks to this kind of distorted children''s story, Hans becomes fascinated with Hitler as he and the rest of the younger members of the Hitler Youth give the Hitler salute to a portrait of Hitler dressed as a knight.
In the following segment, the audience sees Hans sick and bedridden. His mother prays for him, knowing it will only be a matter of time before the authorities come and take him away to serve Hitler. A Nazi officer bangs on the door to take Hans away, but his mother says he is sick and needs care. The officer orders her to heal her son quickly and have him ready to leave, implying if Hans does not get well, he will be euthanized. He orders her not to do anything more to him that will cause him to lose heart and be weak, explaining that a soldier must show no emotion, mercy, or feelings whatsoever.
Hans eventually recovers and resumes his "education" in a school classroom, where Hans and the rest of his classmates, all in Hitlerjugend uniforms, give the Hitler salute to portraits of Hitler, Hermann Göring, and Joseph Goebbels. They then watch as the teacher draws a cartoon on the blackboard of a rabbit being eaten by a fox, prompting Hans to feel sorry for the rabbit. The teacher, furious over the remark, orders Hans to sit in the corner wearing a dunce cap. As Hans sits in the corner, he hears the rest of the classmates "correctly" interpret the cartoon as "weakness has no place in a soldier" and "the strong shall rule the weak". This causes Hans to recant his remark and agree that the weak must be destroyed.
Hans then takes part in a book-burning crusade, burning any books with ideas opposed to Hitler''s (Albert Einstein, Baruch Spinoza, and Voltaire), replacing the Bible with Mein Kampf and the crucifix with a Nazi sword, and burning a Catholic church. Hans then spends the next several years "Marching and heiling, heiling and marching!". He reaches his teens (wearing a uniform similar to that of the Sturmabteilung) still "marching and heiling" until he becomes an adult or "Good Nazi" (now in Wehrmacht uniform) embroiled in hatred towards anyone else who opposes Hitler. With "no seed of laughter, hope, tolerance, or mercy" planted in him, he "sees no more than the party wants him to [see], says nothing but what the party wants him to say, and he does nothing but what the party wants him to do."
In the end, Hans and the rest of the German soldiers march off to war only to fade into rows of identical graves, with nothing on them except a swastika and a helmet perched on top. Thus Hans''s education is complete – "his education... for death."','["Clyde Geronimi"]',NULL,NULL,'[""]','7.1','["tt0035120","tt0031790","tt0036295","tt0088805","tt0933357","tt0046408","tt1720261","tt0475730","tt0025071","tt0024404","tt0036497","tt0168184"]','["WWII","RKO Radio Pictures","World War, 1939-1945","World War II","National Socialism And Youth","Walt Disney","World War, 1939-1945 -- United States -- Caricatures and cartoons","WWII In Color"]','[{"url":"/EducationForDeathTheMakingOfTheNazi.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/EducationForDeathTheMakingOfTheNazi_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','EducationForDeathTheMakingOfTheNazi',31288,'Q1291269','wp','["Gregor Ziemer"]',NULL,'["Art Smith"]',NULL,NULL,NULL),

Dr. Paul Carruthers (Bela Lugosi), a chemist and physician in the small town of Heathville, is offered a $5,000 bonus from his employers for his contributions to the company, a pittance compared to the million dollars in income the company earned from his work. (His employers argue that he took a buyout early in the company''s history instead of retaining his partnership stake.) Embittered and insulted, he seeks revenge and develops a system in which ordinary bats are enlarged to massive size, training them to be drawn to a new, pungent aftershave he is testing. He cleverly distributes the lotion to his enemies as a "test" product.
Once they have applied the lotion, the chemist then releases his Devil Bats in the night, targeting the families of his employer''s owners. The bats succeed in attacking and killing one of the owners and two of his sons. A hot shot reporter from the Chicago Register, Johnny Layton (Dave O''Brien) gets assigned by his editor (Arthur Q. Bryan) to cover and help solve the murders. He and his bumbling photographer "One-Shot" McGuire (Donald Kerr) begin to unwind the mystery with some comic sidelights.
In the climactic closing scene, Layton dumps a sample of the aftershave on Carruthers, leading the bat to attack and kill its own master. Mary, the last surviving member of her family, runs into Johnny''s arms.','["Jean Yarbrough"]','["John T.

While Angelo sometimes works around the odds at the track by putting front-running horses off their stride with a pellet gun, in this case Angelo''s horse wins without outside interference and pays off big.

When his grandfather back in Texas dies, he inherits $200,000. In a nearby port he meets with the testament executor, attorney Daniel Bergstrom (Charles Arnt) to receive the good news, but when he is to return to the jungle, he is followed by a suspicious man hired by the attorney, who tries to knock him out. Joe instead manages to kill the man, and boards a ship in the port.
On the ship, the Merman, is Dawson (Alec Craig), a steward who helped Joe against his unknown assailant. Also on the ship are Captain Saul (William Edmunds) and his mate, Buck Harris (Victor Kilian). Among the few passengers is the alluring Nita Paxton (Phyllis Brooks), a cabaret artist whom Joe takes a liking to the minute he boards the ship.
Before the ship lands in its first port on the cruise, Dawson is murdered, and Joe gets rid of the body by feeding it to the fish, to avoid being blamed for his death. On shore in Los Altos, Joe and Nita go off romancing together. Upon their return to the ship, Joe discovers that Bergstrom has come aboard and brought a man calling himself Joe Beck (Jack La Rue). Joe instantly suspects Nita of being in cahoots with Bergstrom, trying to trick him out of his inheritance. She then confides in him, that Dawson was an undercover agent for an insurance company, suspecting the captain and his crew of insurance fraud. She is trying to finish his work after he disappeared.
Waiting for Joe in his cabin are Bergstrom and the impostor, who hold him at gun point, demanding he give them his ID and papers. Joe overpowers the impostor, grabs the gun and forces the men to leave his cabin.
In the middle of the night, Joe wakes up from the ship crashing into some sharp rocks. He tries to stop Saul and take the wheel, but is knocked unconscious and locked into his cabin. Nita manages to break down the door with an axe and free him. The only ones left on the ship are the two of them and Bergstrom and his impostor, since the rest of the crew has escaped on a life raft. Bergstrom suggest they work together to stay alive, assuring Joe he has given up his plan to take his money.
Still, when they hear on the radio that planes are sent out to rescue them, Bergstrom makes Joe fall hard into a deep hole in the deck. He is again knocked out and wakes up in a hospital a few days later.
Joe goes to Galveston, Texas, to collect his identification which he has sent in advance by mail, but finds that Nita has already been there in his place and fetched the papers. He tracks her down and discovers her with Bergstrom and the impostor. They threaten to kill her, demanding the papers.
Joe climbs into the apartment through a window, and in self-defence manages to shoot and kill the impostor just as Bergstrom gets his hands on the papers. Bergstrom calls the police, trying to get Joe arrested for the impostor''s murder, but Joe overpowers him and when the police arrive, Bergstrom is arrested instead.

Stunned, bewildered, and bemused, they tell Akio''s mother what they have seen, but she dismisses their story as childish nonsense. The next day, the two boys — with Akio''s younger sister, Tomoko, in tow — cycle to the site to investigate. Enthralled, Akio and Tom manage to steal into the spaceship. But then, without warning, the ship takes off, leaving Tomoko behind. It soars into outer space toward a field of asteroids, which sends the boys into a panic. However, Gamera (obviously aware of the boys'' plight) appears and clears a path for the ship through the asteroids. The spaceship, flying near the speed of light, leaves Gamera behind and transports the boys to an unknown planet, where it lands on the outskirts of an alien city. Suddenly, a silver "Space" Gyaos appears, menacing the ship and the two young boys. Just before the creature attacks, a second, bizarre monster — whose head resembles a Bowie knife — emerges from an underground lair and attacks the Space Gyaos. The Space Gyaos emits a beam that reflects off the new creature''s blade-shaped head and cuts off its own right leg. After the Space Gyaos attempts to retreat, the knife-headed creature lunges and chops off the Space Gyaos'' left wing, before cutting off its right wing. The creature then cuts the helpless Space Gyaos'' head off and brutally cuts the body into smaller pieces before retreating back to its lair.
Akio and Tom explore a portion of the alien city and meet the planet''s only inhabitants: two beautiful women, named Barbella and Florbella, who explain that their planet, known as "Terra", orbits the sun directly opposite the earth, which is why it has never been discovered by Earth''s astronomers. Furthermore, Terra is facing extinction; not only is the planet growing cold, but the Space Gyaos are taking it over and the two women are the last of their kind. The knife-headed monster, which the Terrans call "Guiron", is their last defense against the Space Gyaos.
Barbella and Florbella suddenly turn on Tom and Akio and put them into restraints. Using their super-technological devices, the alien women probe the boys'' minds, in the process learning about Gamera and its soft spot for children. It is revealed that the Terran women are cannibals that plan to feed on the boys'' brains in order to absorb their knowledge. In preparation to extract Akio''s brain for their nourishment, the women shave the child''s head. On a rescue mission, Gamera lands on Terra in search of the boys. The women deploy Guiron to attack the giant turtle. Guiron plans to cut Gamera in half, but Gamera grabs one of Guiron''s front legs and bites into it. Guiron tries to shake off the towering tortoise. Wrapping his tail onto a monolith, Gamera throws Guiron into a canyon, causing his knife-head to be stuck. Gamera uses his flame breath on Guiron. Guiron uses his shurikens to penetrate Gamera''s cheeks. Gamera tries to heal his wounds by grabbing ice-like boulders. Guiron uses his shurikens again and this time Gamera uses the longest boulder to ricochet the shurikens into Guiron''s own body. Guiron trudges away, while Gamera tumbles into a lake unconscious and on his back.
Tom manages to free Akio, but, in the process, unintentionally releases Guiron. No longer under the aliens'' control, Guiron rampages through the Terran city — even attacking its own mistresses as they attempt to flee to Earth. The knife-headed creature slices the spacecraft in half, mortally injuring Barbella; Florbella kills Barbella as she relates that useless members of their society are euthanized. While Guiron attacks the base where the boys are imprisoned, Gamera awakes and renews his assault on the alien creature, ultimately ramming Guiron''s head into the ground. Florbella attempts to flee on a rocket, but the vehicle is sliced in half by Guiron and she dies as a result. Gamera catches half of the rocket and spears Guiron into his shuriken base. Gamera uses his flame breath on Guiron again where the rocket was; the rocket then explodes, cutting Guiron in half. Gamera uses his flame breath to weld the alien spacecraft back together and carries the ship and the two boys back to Earth. On Earth, the boys are returned to their mothers and they all say goodbye to Gamera as he flies off into the night.','["Noriaki Yuasa"]',NULL,'["Nobuhiro Kajima","Miyuki Akiyama","Christopher Murphy"]','[""]','4.1','["tt0063000","tt0061695","tt0065755","tt0467923","tt0434964","tt0070122","tt0117089","tt0061550","tt0104352","tt0073373","tt0064373","tt0068371"]','["Gamera; MST3K; alien; sci-fi; kaiju"]','[{"url":"/Attack_of_the_Monsters.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Attack_of_the_Monsters_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/Attack_of_the_Monsters_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','Attack_of_the_Monsters',75000,'Q670070','wp','["Niisan Takahashi"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Jack makes advances to Cosman employee Polly (Dorothy Ford), but he is thwarted by the arrival of her boyfriend, a towering police officer (Buddy Baer). Polly assigns Dinkle and Jack to babysit for Eloise Larkin''s brother and infant sister, while Eloise (Shaye Cogan) and her fiancé (James Alexander) are out for the evening. The babysitting duties are complicated by the fact that Donald (David Stollery) is something of a prodigy, as well as a self-proclaimed "problem child". The dull-witted Jack is soon outclassed by the child, and an attempt to lull the boy to sleep by reading the fairy tale Jack and the Beanstalk (Jack''s "favorite novel") aloud fails when Jack stumbles over the larger words. Bemused by Jack''s incompetence, Donald reads the story instead—a role-reversal made complete when Jack falls asleep as Donald reads. In his slumber, Jack dreams that he is the young Jack of the fairy tale.
In his dream Jack learns that the Giant (Buddy Baer), who lives in a castle in the sky, has stolen all of the land''s wealth and food. The situation obliges the kingdom''s princess to marry The Prince (James Alexander) of a neighboring kingdom, whom she has never met.
Jack must also make sacrifices, when his mother sends him to sell the last family possession, their beloved cow "Henry", to the local butcher, Mr. Dinklepuss. Along the way Jack meets The Prince, disguised as a troubador (who is kidnapped by the Giant soon afterward). The unscrupulous Dinklepuss pays Jack five "magic" beans for the cow. Upon returning home, Jack learns that the Giant has also kidnapped The Princess (Shaye Cogan) and Henry.
Undeterred by his mother''s disappointment over bringing home only beans, Jack plants them and a gigantic beanstalk grows overnight. He decides to climb the beanstalk to rescue everyone from the Giant''s clutches, as well as to retrieve "Nellie", the golden-egg laying hen that the Giant previously stole from Jack''s family. Upon learning of Nellie''s existence, Dinklepuss decides to join Jack on the adventure.
When they reach the top of the beanstalk Jack and Dinklepuss are captured by the Giant and imprisoned with the prince and princess. The princess falls for the troubador after he serenades her, only to later learn this is the same prince she was betrothed. After the Giant releases Dinklepuss and Jack from the dungeon in order to toil around his castle, they befriend his housekeeper, Polly, who helps them escape over the castle wall along with the royal prisoners, Nellie and some of the Giant''s stolen gems (pilfered by the greedy Dinklepuss). They flee down the beanstalk with the Giant in pursuit, as Polly escapes the castle behind him, astride Henry. During the descent, Dinklepuss loses Nellie (who falls into the arms of Jack''s mother) and then the gems, which rain down upon the impoverished townsfolk below. Once all are on the ground, Jack chops down the beanstalk, sending the Giant falling to his death. The villagers rejoice over their liberation by dancing around the hole the Giant made from his fall while amusingly singing "He Never Looked Better in his Life".
Just before being rewarded by the King for heroism, Jack is rudely awakened from his dream by Donald, who breaks a vase over Jack''s head as Eloise and Arthur return home. Jack''s angry outburst over Donald''s behavior results in a second blow to the head from Dinkle, which returns Jack to his dream state. After greeting the others as their storybook counterparts, Jack walks off into the night with the bravado of "Jack the Giant-Killer".','["Jean Yarbrough"]','["Nathaniel Curtis","Pat Costello"]','["Bud Abbott","Lou Costello","Buddy Baer"]','["Comedy","Family","Fantasy","Musical","Romance"]','6.0','["tt0039998","tt0039226","tt0074705","tt0061830","tt0044229","tt1079968","tt0173937","tt0292027","tt0166666","tt0058230","tt0024852","tt0148346"]','["comedy; fantasy; fairy tales; Abbott & Costello"]','[{"url":"/ccoPublicDomainJack_and_the_Beanstalk.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/ccoPublicDomainJack_and_the_Beanstalk_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/cco_jackandthebeanstalk_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','cco_jackandthebeanstalk',259668,'Q3794139','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

They are living under an ancient curse, by which they cannot emerge onto the surface, except by moonlight, and sunlight is deadly to them. They worship the goddess of the moon.
The ''mole men'', led by Halis Mosab, a tyrannical and bloodthirsty non-albino queen, are using the captured people as slaves to operate their diamond mining operations.

The robbery goes bad, and the mobsters capture some of Muller''s men and force them to identify the rest before killing them. Stansyck has a reputation for tracking down and killing his enemies, no matter how long it takes, so Muller decides to leave town and hide. He takes an office job recommended by his law-abiding brother, Frederick (Eduard Franz), but quickly decides that working for a living is not for him.  

A chance encounter with dentist Dr. Swangron (John Qualen) reveals that Muller looks exactly like a psychoanalyst who works in the same building, Dr. Bartok, the only difference being a large scar on the left side of the doctor''s face. Seizing the opportunity, he begins researching Bartok, even slipping into his office to examine his records. He is discovered by the doctor''s secretary, Evelyn Hahn (Joan Bennett). She mistakes him for her employer and kisses him, but quickly realizes he is someone else. He persuades her to go out with him, though she has become embittered and claims to have given up any dreams of finding love.
Muller sets out to impersonate Bartok, aided by the fact he studied psychoanalysis in medical school before dropping out. He takes a photograph of the doctor and uses it as a guide to cut an identical scar on his own face. Unfortunately, the developers of the photograph reversed the negative, so now Muller has the scar on the wrong side. He discovers the mistake only after he has already murdered Bartok and is preparing to dump the body in the river. He has no choice but to go through with the plan anyway. Luckily, no one (except the office cleaning lady, whose suspicions he manages to lull) notices the difference, not even Evelyn or Bartok''s patients.
Muller discovers "he" has a girlfriend, Virginia Taylor (Leslie Brooks), and that they frequent Maxwell''s, a high class casino. It also turns out Bartok has been losing heavily.
When a worried Frederick Muller tries to contact his brother, the trail leads to Bartok. The scar convinces Frederick that the man he sees is merely a lookalike. Evelyn, previously unaware of the switch (but now very suspicious), reveals that John Muller said he was going to Paris. Frederick Muller tells "Bartok" that his brother no longer has to hide; Stansyck was convicted for "income tax problems" and is scheduled to be deported.
Afterward, Evelyn realizes that Muller is an imposter and that he must have killed the psychoanalyst. Though he admits to her he did, she does not turn him in to the police; instead she purchases a ticket to sail to Honolulu. Muller finds out and promises he will go with her, but she does not believe he would leave such an opportunity to enrich himself. Muller arranges for other doctors to take care of his patients and heads to the dock. There, however, he is intercepted by two men who want to discuss Bartok''s $90,000 gambling debt. When Muller tries to break away, they fatally shoot him. Evelyn sails away, unaware that Muller lies dying on the dock.',NULL,'["Daniel Fuchs","Murray Forbes"]','["Paul Henreid","Joan Bennett","Eduard Franz"]','["Crime","Drama","Film-Noir","Thriller"]','6.8','["tt0040695","tt0040427","tt0042707","tt0041968","tt0043142","tt0041198","tt0043435","tt0039881","tt0044789","tt0040257","tt0042952","tt0039313"]','["film noir, Joan Bennett, The Scar"]','[{"url":"/THE_SCAR.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/THE_SCAR1.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/THE_SCAR2.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/The_Scar_1948_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/VTS_02_1.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/VTS_02_1_512Kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/VTS_03_1.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/VTS_03_1_512Kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/VTS_03_2.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/VTS_03_2_512Kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/VTS_03_3.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/VTS_03_3_512Kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/VTS_03_4.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/VTS_03_4_512Kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','The_Scar_1948',58370,'Q3220245','wp',NULL,'["Steve Sekely","Paul Henreid"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Anita and Tony are immediately attracted to each other and get married. She becomes his assistant in the act.
One night, Tony becomes drunk in the company of a woman reporter and boasts he will jump out of an aircraft at 15,000 feet (4,600 m) with his hands handcuffed behind his back. When she prints his claim, he first tries to get out of it with a fake cast on his arm, but when he sees the thousands of fans, he goes through with it, freeing himself in mid-air and parachuting safely to the ground. He promises Anita that he will not attempt the dangerous stunt again, but soon breaks his word and performs it repeatedly all over the world.
Anita becomes weary of the constant travel and longs to settle down and start a family. Secretly, she sells her jewelry and has a house built in the Connecticut countryside. When it is completed, she shows Tony a picture of it, but his uninterested reaction stops her from telling him it is theirs. When he signs up for a two-year, round-the-world tour rather than take the vacation he had promised, she finally gives up. She leaves him and gets a divorce in Reno. Anita''s grandfather, Bishop Peabody (C. Aubrey Smith), breaks the news to the distraught Tony.
On a sea cruise with her Aunt Abby (Billie Burke), Anita is surprised to run into her old fiancé Don. She gets the ship''s captain to marry them. However, she spends their honeymoon night with her grandfather. The next night, Don insists on introducing her to his boss, Harley Bingham (Raymond Walburn), at a nightclub. The entertainment is none other than the Great Arturo, with his old assistant, Lola De Vere (Virginia Field). He soon persuades Bingham to let him perform at Bingham''s company retreat at a resort, much to Anita''s discomfort.
Mrs. Bingham (ZaSu Pitts) has a dilemma, though. They have not booked enough rooms to provide separate bedrooms for the unmarried Tony and Lola. Tony suggests he and Don share one room, while Anita and Lola take the other. During his stay, Tony tries unsuccessfully to persuade Anita to take him back. Meanwhile, the hapless Don becomes sick, and the doctor prescribes no physical activity of any sort for a month.
Bishop Peabody is told by his lawyer that Anita''s divorce is not legal. Later, he informs his granddaughter that Tony will be doing his parachute stunt that day. She attends. Tony tells his valet and friend Benton (Hugh Herbert) that he hid a lockpick in the wrong airplane, but goes ahead with the trick anyway. He frees himself dangerously close to the ground. After he is pulled unconscious out of the water, Anita rushes to his side. When he regains consciousness, they are reconciled.

Marguerite is constantly surrounded by suitors, whom she entertains at her lavish apartment.  She also has consumption and is frequently beset by bouts of illness.
Armand sees Marguerite at the opera and, later, pursues her when he attends one of her private parties.  She rejects his advances at first, but eventually returns his affection.
The two live happily together until Armand''s father, seeking to protect his family''s reputation, convinces Marguerite to end the relationship.  She finally relents and runs away to a wealthy client, leaving a note for Armand.
When Armand finds the note he is shattered. The sorrow eventually turns to rage, and he decides to plunge into Parisian nightlife, associating himself with Olympe, another courtesan.  When he sees Marguerite at a casino, he publicly denounces her.
Marguerite gives up her life as a courtesan and quickly finds herself in massive debt. Her illness also takes a heavy toll.  Eventually, as she lies dying in bed, her furniture and belongings are repossessed. She persuades the men taking her belongings to allow her to keep her most precious possession: a book - Manon Lescaut - Armand gave to her.
Marguerite dies lying in bed in her apartment holding the book Armand gave her,  wishing to sleep where she is happy dreaming about Armand. Marguerite''s maid Nanine, and her newlywed friends Gaston and Nichette are at her bedside as she dies.  Unlike the original novel, the film does not depict Armand and Marguerite ever seeing each other again after the casino scene and offers no suggestion that Armand ever learned of Marguerite''s sacrifice and true feelings for him.','["Ray C.

That night, Daisy Bunting (June Tripp), a blonde model, is at a fashion show when she and the other showgirls hear the news. The blonde girls are horrified; hiding their hair with dark wigs or hats. Daisy laughs at their fears, and returns home to her parents, Mr and Mrs Bunting (Arthur Chesney and Marie Ault), and her policeman sweetheart, Joe (Malcolm Keen); they have been reading about the crime in the newspaper.
A handsome young man (Ivor Novello), bearing a strong resemblance to the description of the murderer, arrives at the house and asks about the room for rent. Mrs. Bunting shows him the room, which is decorated with portraits of beautiful young blond women. The man is rather secretive, which puzzles Mrs. Bunting. However he willingly pays her a month''s rent in advance, and asks only for a little to eat. Mrs. Bunting is surprised to see that the lodger is turning all the portraits around to face the wall – he politely requests that they be removed. Daisy comes in to remove the portraits, and an attraction begins to form between Daisy and the lodger. The women return downstairs, where they hear the lodger''s heavy footsteps as he paces the floor.
The relationship between Daisy and the reclusive lodger gradually becomes serious, and Joe, newly assigned to the Avenger case, begins to resent this. The following Tuesday, Mrs. Bunting is awoken late at night by the lodger leaving the house. She attempts to search his room, but a small cabinet is locked tight. In the morning, another blonde girl is found dead, just around the corner.
The police observe that the murders are moving towards the Buntings'' neighbourhood. Mrs. Bunting tells her husband that she believes the lodger is the Avenger, and the two try to prevent Daisy spending time with him. The next Tuesday night, Daisy and the lodger sneak away for a late-night date. Joe tracks them down and confronts them; Daisy breaks up with Joe.  Joe begins to piece together the events of the previous weeks, and convinces himself that the lodger is indeed the murdering Avenger.
With a warrant in hand, and two fellow officers in tow, Joe returns to search the lodger''s room. They find a leather bag containing a gun, a map plotting the location of the Avenger''s murders, newspaper clippings about the attacks, and a photograph of a beautiful blonde woman. Joe recognizes this woman as the Avenger''s first victim. The lodger is arrested, despite Daisy''s protests, but he manages to run off into the night. Daisy goes out and finds him, handcuffed, coatless, and shivering. He explains that the woman in the photograph was his sister, a beautiful debutante murdered by the Avenger at a dance she had attended; he had vowed to his dying mother that he would bring the killer to justice.
Daisy takes the lodger to a pub and gives him brandy to warm him, hiding his handcuffs with a cloak. The locals, suspicious of the pair, pursue them, quickly gathering numbers until they are a veritable lynch mob.

('tt0032690','free','The Last Alarm (1940)','1940','1h 1min','Captain Jim Hadley, Fire Chief, has his retirement dinner after 40 years in the service. Next day, time hangs very heavy on his hands so that he even chats to a brush salesman (who has a perfect Elmer Fudd voice.) Bored he later visits his old fire station; Fire Company No.7 and talks to the men there, who are called out on a fire.
The Great Eastern Insurance Company where Frank Rogers (who is interested in Hadley’s daughter Jane) works. There has been a number of fires lately and a firebug (arsonist) is suspected. This thought is echoed at the Arson Bureau where Lieutenant King, chased up by the Mayor, tells Henderson and Roberts he wants results. They know it is an arsonist who uses time bombs and petrol. The arsonist turns out to be the keeper of an antiques shop, which Joan visits.
Jim is making plans for the future with Burt Stafford who is due to retire soon. Burt is called out on a fire with the others and is very badly injured there. He dies in hospital, with Jim standing beside him. The antiques man has called at the Hadley home to bring a salt and pepper set he had to do minor work on, which Joan had bought. She sees the gleam in his eyes when she lights a match.
Jim joins the arson investigation at the bureau, having had some experience when he was in the fire brigade. Spectroscopic analysis of wood found at the scene of the last big fire reveals that part of the burnt time bomb box Jim found was maple wood, so he, Henderson and Roberts scour the city for the maker of the boxes and who they sold them to.
At another big fire, Jim comes across a statue of Vulcan (Roman god of fire) which the arsonist dropped, it being his inspiration. The arsonist gets it from Jim’s unlocked car where he put it. Mention of this statue later and the fact that Frank and Joan saw it in the antique shop window provide a strong lead so they get a search warrant. They do not find any bomb making equipment but Jim finds wood shavings which later analysis reveals to be the same wood as that used for the time bomb box.
Jim and Frank go after the arsonist who has lost his bureau tail. The arsonist goes to the basement of the Hadley house where he plants a time bomb. He goes upstairs and confronts Mrs Hadley and Joan and as Jim and Frank realise he may be back at their house, having been seen in the vicinity, the bomb goes off and the basement catches fire. The arsonist tells the women Jim should not have interfered in his work. The men bust in the door and while Frank escorts the women outside, Jim goes after the arsonist, who now babbling about being the god of fire, falls down the basement steps into the burning basement and dies. Some time later there is another dinner in honour of Jim who has got a new job. Honorary Fire Chief of the city.

Then a Japanese kamikaze pilot, who was hiding in a cloud, attacks the ship. Hook runs away, but finds a huge collection of war bonds which he literally uses as ammunition for his plane. After a few chase scenes Hook defeats the Japanese soldier by throwing the warbonds at the Japanese pilot who crashes down on an island, leaving only his clattering teeth behind. Back in 1953 Hook tells his son that thanks to the war bonds we won the war and it paid for their home, their new furniture and their new plane.

Tony Bronson (Ralph Byrd) is the new purser for the flight who disrupts the robbery of New York journalist Jim Halsey (Jack Mulhall) at their hotel.
Halsey is a passenger on the same Trans-Caribbean Airlines flight, flying to America to begin an assignment for his newspaper that will ultimately have him stationed in the Orient. Having some money left, Halsey fixes Tony up on a double date with two entertainers in a "sister act", Ann Howard (Julie Duncan) and her partner, Peggy Morton (Carol Hughes). The pair have only just been informed that their show in New York has been cancelled and are stranded in Puerto Nueva, without the fare to leave.  Ann uses her feminine wiles to con Tony into arranging free passage for them on the Clipper. Nonetheless, Tony falls in love with Ann, and Jim proposes to Peggy.
Among the other passengers are Madden (Johnstone White), Ryan (Richard Clarke), Desser (Paul Bryar) and "Professor" Carter (I. Stanford Jolley), their ringleader and a former pilot who flew Clippers for the airline. Their plan is to hijack the aircraft in mid-air, rob the passengers and steal a shipment of $500,000 in the safe on board. Carter will then land in a remote area of the Caribbean Sea where the gang and their loot will be picked up.
When they take over the aircraft by killing the navigator and co-pilot, Carter has the passengers locked in their quarters and the crew locked in the cargo compartment. After landing, although the gang has the money from their captives, the safe is locked and only Tony can open it. Ryan is ordered to force the purser to open the safe but in a struggle for Ryan''s gun, Tony shoots him, and makes his escape, jumping from the aircraft. Swimming over to the cargo hold, he frees the pilot, Capt. Hank MacFarland (Kenneth Harlan) and the rest of the crew, then returns to the cockpit where Carter threatens to burn the Clipper. Tony overpowers him, and holding the rest of the gang at gunpoint, allows MacFarland to regain control of the aircraft.

('tt0059080','free','Daikaijû Gamera (1965)','1965','1h 18min','In the Arctic, an unknown aircraft is shot down by an American jet fighter. The aircraft crashes and its cargo, a low-level atomic bomb, explodes. The resulting cataclysm awakens a prehistoric monster that has the appearance of a giant turtle with teeth and large tusks. Japanese scientists on an expedition nearby (including Drs. Hidaka, Kyoko and Aoyagi) are given a "devil stone" by an Inuit chieftain, who explains that the creature is called Gamera.
Gamera destroys the American jet with his fire breath and escapes into the sea. The monster heads to Japan and surfaces in Sagami Bay where Toshio, a boy releasing his own pet turtle, sees him. Gamera destroys the city of Fujisawa and a lighthouse. However, he also rescues Toshio from falling from the lighthouse, and then retreats back into the sea. Scientists and government officials hold a conference to discuss killing the monster.
Gamera destroys a research ship, kills the crew and then heads to Tokyo. He is attacked with freeze bombs and blown up, falling onto his back as a result. The scientists indicate that a turtle cannot right itself once on its back and that Gamera will therefore die of starvation. Gamera then pulls its head, limbs and tail into its shell, emits flames from its front leg and back leg cavities, and flies away by rising up into the air and spinning around like a flying saucer.
Toshio and his family decide to stay with an uncle in Tokyo because they have nowhere else to go. Toshio explains to the professor that Gamera is lonely and, like regular turtles, he is not evil. Dr. Hidaka, meanwhile, has observed that Gamera consumes fossil fuels and may seek out atomic bombs for the energy they provide. He also emits radio signals. This leads the Japan Atomic Energy Commission to see an opportunity to use its nuclear stockpiles. Meanwhile, disasters and accidents start to occur: Koto Ward is struck by flash floods and ships collide in Tokyo Bay. Dr. Hidaka claims that Gamera has caused these accidents because he is hiding in the bay.
An international scientific conference is called and they decide to use "Z Plan", based at Oshima Island, involving a consortium of American, Soviet and Japanese scientists to eradicate Gamera. Before any action can be taken, however, Gamera arrives at Haneda Airport, destroying the control tower, and proceeds to wreak havoc in Tokyo (including destroying the Tokyo Tower). Toshio and his family evacuate again, but Toshio gets lost in the confusion.
Z Plan is still not ready, so the scientists plan to keep Gamera at bay in the meantime by confining him to an oil refinery. Dr. Hidaka has surmised that Gamera is gaining energy by consuming fires at the refinery and they will therefore keep shipping petroleum there by train to keep Gamera occupied for 24 hours. Toshio finds his way to the refinery and sneaks on board a train bound for Gamera, chased by the refinery chief. They are both thrown from the train when it explodes, but are unharmed and Toshio is sent on his way.
Z Plan is finally completed and Toshio sneaks on board a ship delivering supplies to Oshima. Gamera is lured to Oshima by lighting an oil slick path from Tokyo to the island, but an oncoming typhoon blows the fire out. Aoyagi starts a bonfire and Gamera makes his way to a volcano erupting on the island. The next day, Z Plan is put into action: Gamera is lured into the nose cone of a giant rocket and launched on a one-way trip to Mars. The worldwide announcement of success extols the triumph of science over ideology. Aoyagi and Kyoko go off together and Toshio decides he is not sad, because he is going to be a scientist one day so he can visit Gamera on Mars.','["Noriaki Yuasa"]',NULL,'["Eiji Funakoshi","Harumi Kiritachi","Junichiro Yamashita"]','[""]','4.9','["tt0060446","tt0116390","tt0113142","tt0184503","tt0061868","tt0065776","tt0059205","tt0067123","tt0109916","tt0255198","tt0071565","tt0097444"]','["Gammera; Third Eye Cinema; 1960''s; Sci-Fi/Horror"]','[{"url":"/gamera.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/gamera_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/gammera_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','gammera',54683,'Q1916669','wp','["Niisan Takahashi"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Muggs (Leo Gorcey), however, is the only one of the kids who refuses to work, although he drives the gang to work in his jalopy.  Once at the aviation company, he spends his time flirting with a flight nurse named Helen Munson (Joan Barclay) who is in love with her test pilot boyfriend, Tom Lawson (Dave O''Brien).
One day, when Tom''s aircraft crashes at the plant airstrip, Reynolds suspects that the crash may have been the work of saboteurs. Later, at the airfield, Muggs jokingly appoints himself as the new operator of the flying ambulance owned by Dr. Richard Nagel (George Pembroke) and gives his pals a tour of the aircraft. Their playful games are soon brought to a halt by Nagel, the secret leader of a spy ring, who angrily orders the group off his aircraft.
Mr. Reynolds, certain that spies are working at the plant, asks Danny to act as a decoy so that the spies can be identified, and has him deliver to a downtown office a fake set of plans for a new bombsight. As Reynolds predicted, Nagel''s men ambush Danny on his way to the office, but the plan goes awry when the detectives sent to trail Danny lose him. Danny eventually turns up unharmed some time later. When Muggs reports to Reynolds his suspicions that Nagel is behind the espionage ring, Reynolds dismisses the accusation as a product of the boy''s imagination.
Not convinced by Reynolds that Nagel is innocent, Muggs and Danny begin their own investigation into Nagel, starting with a visit to the doctor on the pretext of a fake ailment. The visit turns up nothing, however, and when Danny and Muggs return to the hangar, a suspicious "accident" that was apparently meant to harm them leaves Peewee injured. While Peewee recovers at the hospital, Tom nearly loses his life when he is unable to make contact with the control tower for a landing. The controller is later found bound and gagged in the tower, prompting the kids to resume their investigation in earnest.
Helen provides the gang with further clues when she confirms that the ambulance plane was being flown on many unusual trips to Mexico, supposedly to deliver patients. When Helen tells the East Side Kids that a man named Forbes is the next "patient" to be transported, they rush to his house, where they find secret plans hidden in his head bandage. Disguising Danny as the transportee, the kids send Danny and Muggs on the flight to learn who is behind the espionage ring. Danny and Muggs soon find themselves in trouble, however, when Nagel, having found Forbes locked in his closet, tries to warn the pilot of the boys'' ruse.
Meanwhile, Tom learns of the dangerous mission and goes after the flying ambulance in his own aircraft. Tom arrives in Mexico in time to save Danny and Muggs, and all the spies are arrested. Back at the plant, Reynolds rewards Muggs for his heroism by giving him a job as his driver, but his stint there is short-lived as he is soon distracted by a pretty woman and crashes the car with Reynolds in it.','["William West"]','["Al Martin","Al Martin"]','["Leo Gorcey","Bobby Jordan","Joan Barclay"]','["Action","Comedy","Drama"]','5.9','["tt0035345","tt0034224","tt0035092","tt0037074","tt0032277","tt0034973","tt0034064","tt0036073","tt0034420","tt0033144","tt0033428","tt0044067"]','["Comedy;East Side Kids"]','[{"url":"/flying_wild.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/flying_wild_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/flying_wild_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','flying_wild',24185,'Q5463559','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Each time she comes in there is a letter from her husband overseas, and she remembers their conversations before he went off to war. She was concerned about him, because she felt it was a "young man''s war" and he should stay home with her and the baby. However he was insistent that his country needed him. The plot then turns to the husband trying to manage his ship while it is being attacked by a submarine. The next day, the woman receives another letter from her husband, who is shown in double exposure, reminding her that freedom comes high, often at the price of human lives. The door bell rings, and it is a Western Union telegram, saying that her husband died.
The point of the film was to communicate to the American people that many of their sons and husbands who were going overseas, would not be coming back, and that they would have to understand they would be sacrificing their loved ones to secure freedom.

This threatens the plans of Henry Mitchell (Douglass Dumbrille), who holds exclusive logging rights for the forest. Mitchell figures that if the moths infest and kill the trees, he can harvest all the dead trees, unencumbered by logging restrictions. When Carter tries to phone in the infestation threat, Mitchell covertly cuts the line, forcing Carter to ride into town to report the problem. Meanwhile, along the trail, Gene Autry (Gene Autry) and Forester Joe Lucas (Jimmy Lloyd), who have been drinking, come across a mountain lion, and Gene fires several shots at the wild animal. Mitchell, who has been following the forester, uses the last shot as cover to shoot Carter in the back, leaving him where Autry will assume Carter was killed by his errant shot.
At the inquest, Gene is cleared of any charges, and he is freed. He sells his interest in his forest camp, leaving the money to Carter''s daughter, Helen (Patricia Barry). In grief, he decides to leave the area, but then discovers the moth infestation for himself. Reporting it to the forest service and discovering that his shot could not have killed Carter, he is hired to run a program of aerial spraying of DDT to kill the moth larva before the forest is destroyed. Gene includes his pal, Joe, in the aerial program, but Joe''s problems with alcohol, triggered by the death of his wife, lead to trouble.
Meanwhile, Mitchell has hatched a plot to stop the DDT spraying by covertly spraying a very potent poison over the local livestock, blaming the resulting sickness and death on the DDT. Joe, who has returned to sobriety with the help of Autry, finds the plane and poison being used by Mitchell, but is shot by one of Mitchell''s henchmen, Bill Wright (Damian O''Flynn), as he rides to report the problem. Helen finds Joe and, with the help of Dr. Chadwick (Harry Cheshire), brings him back from the brink of death. When Joe recovers consciousness, he reports his findings to Gene.
When he learns that Wright has aroused the locals to stop the spraying operation, Gene rides to intercept them before they can destroy the planes. He reports Wright''s scheme, and convinces some of the locals to go with him to check it out. Wright has dismantled the plane, and when the locals leave, he captures Gene and Forester Jerry (Jerry Scoggins). They soon escape, however, and arrive at the airfield on time for a brawl to save the aircraft. The sheriff shows up, breaks up the fight, and confiscates everyone''s weapons.
With the help of Helen and Dr. Chadwick, Gene makes Mitchell and Wright believe he is holding the bullet removed from the injured Joe, and that it will be traced to Wright''s confiscated rifle. Mitchell, Wright, and Pete ride to confront Autry, with Mitchell dropping off at a shack along the way to ambush Gene, should he get away. Wright confronts Gene, and after more fighting, he gets away. Pete, however, is captured and leads Gene to a trap by telling him he can find Wright at the shack where Mitchell is waiting.
Later, Pete tries to cut a deal by confessing the truth. Joe realizes he will never catch up to Gene in time to save him, so he rides to the airfield to try an aerial intercept. Wright forces his way onto the plane at gunpoint to escape justice, but once in the air, Joe points out that if he is shot there is no one to fly the aircraft. Joe flies over Gene to warn him, and when that doesn''t work, he selflessly crashes the plane into the shack, killing Wright, Mitchell, and himself. Gene returns to finish the spraying job, with the clear understanding that his future includes a permanent forestry job and married life with Helen.','["John English"]',NULL,'["Gene Autry","Champion","Patricia Barry"]','["Action","Adventure","Music","Western"]','5.8','["tt0040495","tt0041264","tt0028163","tt0028510","tt0041810","tt0030409"]','["Gene Autry"]','[{"url":"/RidersOfTheWhistlingPines.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/RidersOfWhistlingPines_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','RidersOfWhistlingPines',4728,'Q7332648','wp','["Jack Townley"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The weekend getaway is a cover: they are really planning to fly to Colombia to rob a drug lord. They meet with Clint (Ernest Borgnine), who supplies them with weapons and target practice. It becomes clear that with the exception of Stone, the men have no relevant training and are not taking the heist seriously.
The men are flown to a jungle. Their target is Serrano (James Coburn), a sadistic drug lord who lives in a large villa. The group observes Serrano, his staff and various visitors from a hidden vantage point. They discuss whether they would have the courage to actually kill someone, and what they will do with their share of the cash once they return home. They infiltrate the villa, capture Serrano and his lover, and force Serrano to reveal the combination to his safe. They escape from the villa with five million dollars in cash. They travel on foot through the jungle, eventually finding horses to buy. Believing that they have been successful, the men camp for the night and celebrate. They are unaware that they are being observed by a rebel tracker.
When they wake the next day, Serrano’s men and the local military are approaching them in all-terrain vehicles and on horseback. They flee, but Tony and Rockney are captured by Serrano. Stone and Dan have to continue on foot and only escape their pursuers by leaping from a very high rope bridge. Serrano has Rockney beaten to force Tony to reveal the location of money. Knowing that Stone has his share of the cash and that they face better odds of escape in the open, Tony agrees to show them where the money is "hidden".
Serrano has them taken to a prison. They meet Olivia (Lindsay Wagner), the prisoner in the neighboring cell, who claims she was falsely arrested. Tony bribes a passing child to pull out the barred window of their cell with a tow truck. The child demands their clothes in payment also, and they are pursued virtually naked through the town. They lose their pursuers in a bordello. Dressed in women''s clothes, Tony and Rockney make their way to a bus station and reunite with Olivia. They travel together to the rendezvous point.
Dan and Stone are captured by a local rebel leader, General Mariano (Anthony Quinn), who wants the stolen money for himself. They escape, then turn and track the rebels until nightfall. They are forced to kill several of the rebels before they retrieve the cash. The rebels pursue them to the rendezvous point, where they expect to be airlifted to safety. Dan is wounded by Mariano’s tracker. In the ensuing firefight, Tony is shot trying to protect Stone.
Believing Tony is dead, the others continue to the airstrip without him. Serrano’s mercenaries have arrived ahead of them, and a three-way gun battle ensues. Serrano''s men subdue the rebels. The retrieval plane arrives and provides covering fire, scattering Serrano’s men. The plane lands, the team boards hurriedly, and they make their escape. They are celebrating their success when the engine stalls.','["Stewart Raffill"]','["Stewart Raffill","Fernando Celis"]','["James Brolin","Anthony Quinn","Lindsay Wagner"]','["Action","Comedy","Crime"]','5.8','["tt0190065","tt0110386","tt0082612","tt0072399","tt0074875","tt0087451","tt1303803","tt1031276","tt0068892","tt0275527","tt0081230","tt0196596"]','["adventure; action;crime"]','[{"url":"/HighRisk_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/High_Risk.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/High_Risk_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','HighRisk',184540,'Q2152077','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The children suffer from "Merrye Syndrome", a genetic affliction unique to members of their family, which causes them to mentally, socially and physically regress down the evolutionary ladder, starting in late childhood. Two distant relatives arrive with their lawyer and his secretary in order to examine and claim the property as rightful heirs. Bruno''s shaky control over the children deteriorates; murder, chaos and insanity ensue.The siblings, Ralph (Haig), Virginia (Banner), and Elizabeth (Washburn), are inbred, demented, and dangerous. These overgrown children exhibit playful innocence mixed with brutality and feral madness. Virginia is known as "Spider Baby" because of her obsession with spiders. She stalks and eats bugs, moving with a strange and spider-like grace. She also enjoys trapping unsuspecting victims in her rope "web", "stinging" them to death using two butcher knives. After murdering an innocent delivery man (Moreland), Virginia cuts off one of his ears, which she keeps in a match box.
Ralph is a sexually advanced, but mentally deficient simpleton who moves through the house via the dumb-waiter. Unable to speak, Ralph communicates with only grunts and leers. He becomes sexually aroused with the arrival of the two visiting women.
The mysterious Aunt Clara, Aunt Martha, and Uncle Ned, who have regressed even further than the Merrye siblings, live in the cellar. The skeleton of the family''s dead father is kept in a bedroom and is kissed goodnight by Virginia.
Bruno, the children''s sworn and loving protector, has been able to maintain control and keep the family secrets hidden. But when the snooping, greedy cousin Emily (Ohmart) and her brother Peter (Redeker) arrive to take possession of the property, the bizarre behavior of the Merrye clan is revealed.
Peter, Emily, their lawyer Schlocker (Schanzer), and his assistant Ann Morris (Mitchel) insist on staying at the house. Dinner is served after Ralph happily kills a cat for the main course. The revolting meal includes insects, mushrooms, and a garden salad made of weeds.
Bruno leaves on an errand. Despite warning the children to "behave", events spiral downhill as the Merrye kids run merrily amok. Virginia and Elizabeth murder Schlocker and dump his body into the basement, where the demented beastly relatives apparently eat him. The basement dwellers are unleashed. Meanwhile, Emily models some black lingerie as Ralph peeks in. After being chased and then raped by Ralph, Emily becomes sexually aggressive and murderous.
Bruno returns and realizes that he has lost control of the children and of their secret unsavory lives. He lights a bundle of dynamite, blowing himself, the house and the children to bits. This seems to kill all carriers of "Merrye Syndrome".
Smug surviving cousin Peter, who managed to escape the house with Ann, is recounting the story as the movie comes to a close. Addressing the audience, he explains that, as the sole remaining heir, he inherited the Merryes'' vast family fortune, married Ann and wrote a book on the strange "Merrye Syndrome" phenomenon. He adds that his particular branch of the family was distant enough to be immune to the syndrome. However, the camera cuts to Peter''s young daughter, who eerily resembles Virginia, admiring a spider in its web.','["Jack Hill"]',NULL,'["Lon Chaney Jr.","Carol Ohmart","Quinn K.

He is repeatedly denied entry to a drug store due to his drunken state and is forced to remain in the rain. He befriends a fellow drunk who he attempts to mail home by writing his address on his shirt, covering his face in stamps and placing him on top of a mailbox. He befriends a pair of street performers who play the National Anthem for him despite the pouring rain and as a reward he invites them to take shelter in his home from the rain. As Arbuckle parties in the living room with his newfound friends, his wife is awakened by the couple''s pet monkey. Angered, his wife throws the street performers out and announces that she is sick of Arbuckle''s drunken behavior. Reading about an operation rumored to cure alcoholism, she orders Arbuckle to undergo the operation or be thrown out of the house.
The hospital is revealed to be a sanitarium. Arbuckle is horrified when the doctor due to perform his operation (Keaton) emerges with his apron stained with blood. Arbuckle and a female patient (Alice Lake) attempt to escape, but are quickly apprehended. Doctors tell Arbuckle not to go near the girl again, claiming she is crazy. Arbuckle is taken to the operating room 13. As the doctors prepare for surgery, and after Arbuckle''s attempt at postponing the surgery by slipping a clock into his shirt to make the doctors think he has an irregular heartbeat fails, Arbuckle is given anesthetic and falls unconscious.
Arbuckle awakes some time later and decides to escape from the sanitarium and bumps into the female patient from his earlier escape attempt. She tries to convince Arbuckle she is not crazy and that she has been mistakenly committed. They are pursued by doctors into the communal patients ward and a mass pillow fight breaks out between the inmates and the guards, allowing Arbuckle and the girl to escape. Once in the clear, Arbuckle asks the girl if there is anything else he can do for her. She asks him to help her get back into the sanitarium. Realizing the girl is genuinely crazy, Arbuckle ditches her by jumping into a nearby pond and pretending to drown, forcing the girl to go running for help. Doctors give chase and while attempting to flee, Arbuckle finds himself back at the sanitarium. Again he attempts to escape, this time by disguising himself as a nurse. With freedom in sight, Arbuckle runs into Keaton, who believes Arbuckle to be an actual woman and begins to flirt with him. Arbuckle goes along with it so as not to blow his cover. The nurse whose uniform Arbuckle is wearing soon arrives, blowing his cover. Arbuckle makes a break for it, pursued by Keaton across a farm and onto a track where a sponsored race is taking place. Arbuckle manages to beat the other runners to the finish line and is declared the winner. He is awarded the prize money, which he realizes he can use to buy alcohol, but the doctors track him down once again. Arbuckle attempts to run off one last time, but is wrestled to the ground by the doctors. The scene suddenly shifts back to the hospital bed with the doctors shaking Arbuckle awake after his operation, revealing the whole escape attempt to have been nothing more than a dream.','["Roscoe ''Fatty'' Arbuckle"]',NULL,'["Roscoe ''Fatty'' Arbuckle","Buster Keaton","Al St. John"]','["Comedy","Short"]','6.1','["tt0009899","tt0008874","tt0008975","tt0009466","tt0010221","tt0007819","tt0008112","tt0010155","tt0007761","tt0008377","tt0009389","tt0011071"]','["keaton; arbuckle; silent; comety"]','[{"url":"/GoodNightNurse_44_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/GoodNightNurse_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/TheTelephoneAndTheLady.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/TheTelephoneAndTheLady_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','GoodNightNurse_44',11781,'Q3067293','wp','["Roscoe ''Fatty'' Arbuckle"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

With him is a crate containing the frozen remains of a primitive humanoid creature that he discovered in a cave in Manchuria. He hopes it is a missing link in human evolution. Doctor Wells (Peter Cushing), Saxton''s friendly rival and Royal Geological Society colleague, is also on board but travelling separately. Before the train departs Shanghai, a thief is found dead on the platform. His eyes are completely white, without irises or pupils, and a bystander initially mistakes him for a blind man. An Eastern Orthodox monk named Father Pujardov (Alberto de Mendoza), the spiritual advisor to the Polish Count Marion Petrovski (George Rigaud) and Countess Irina Petrovski (Silvia Tortosa), who are also waiting to board the train, proclaims the contents of the crate to be evil. Saxton furiously dismisses this as superstition. Saxton''s eagerness to keep his scientific find secret arouses the suspicion of Wells, who bribes a porter to investigate the crate. The porter is killed by the defrosted humanoid (Juan Olaguivel) within. It then escapes the crate by picking the lock.
The humanoid finds more victims as it roams the moving train. Each is found with the same opaque, white eyes. Autopsies suggest that the brains of the victims are being drained of memories and knowledge. When the humanoid is gunned down by police Inspector Mirov (Julio Peña), the threat seems to have been eliminated. Saxton and Wells discover that external images are retained by a liquid found inside the corpses'' eyeballs, which reveal a prehistoric Earth and a planetary view as seen from space. They deduce that the real threat is somehow a formless extraterrestrial that inhabited the body of the humanoid and now resides inside the inspector. Pujardov, sensing the greater presence within the inspector and believing it to be that of Satan, renounces his faith, pledging allegiance to the entity.
News of the murders is wired to the Russian authorities. An intimidating Cossack officer, Captain Kazan (Telly Savalas), boards with a handful of his men. Kazan believes the train is transporting rebels; he is only convinced of the alien''s existence when Saxton switches off the lights and Mirov''s eyes glow, revealing him to be the alien''s host. It has absorbed the memories of Wells'' assistant, the train driver, and others aboard, and now seeks the Polish count''s metallurgical knowledge in order to build a vessel to escape Earth. Kazan shoots and kills Mirov, and the alien transfers itself to the deranged Pujardov.
The passengers flee to the caboose while Pujardov murders Kazan, his men, and the count, draining all of their memories. Saxton rescues the countess and holds Pujardov at gunpoint. Saxton, having discovered that bright light prevents the alien from draining minds or transferring to another body, forces Pujardov into a brightly lit area. The alien Pujardov explains that it is a collective form of energy from another galaxy. Trapped on Earth in the distant past after being left behind in an accident, it survived for millions of years in the bodies of protozoa, fish, and other animals. It cannot live outside a living being longer than a few moments. The alien begs to be spared, tempting Saxton with its advanced knowledge of technology and cures for diseases. While Saxton is distracted by the offer, the alien resurrects the count''s corpse and attacks him with it.
Saxton and the countess flee, but the alien resurrects all of its victims as zombies. Battling their way through the train, Saxton and the countess eventually reach the guard''s van where the other survivors have taken refuge. Saxton and Wells work desperately to uncouple the caboose from the rest of the train. Kazan''s superiors sends a telegram to a dispatch station ahead, instructing them to destroy the train by sending it down a dead-end spur. Speculating that war has broken out, the station staff switch the track points.
The alien takes control of the train as it enters the spur. Saxton and Wells finally manage to separate the caboose. The alien tries to find the brakes but fails to slow down the train. It rams through the end of spur barrier and plunges down the deep cliff and is destroyed after it hits bottom. The caboose rolls precariously to the end of the track before stopping, inches away from the cliff. The survivors quickly leave, while Saxton, Wells, and the countess gaze over the ravine and witness an inferno engulfing the train and its unearthly inhabitant.','["Eugenio Martín"]','["Arnaud d''Usseau","Julian Zimet"]','["Christopher Lee","Peter Cushing","Alberto de Mendoza"]','["Horror","Sci-Fi"]','6.5','["tt0068424","tt0065854","tt0059125","tt0068230","tt0069341","tt0059727","tt0070868","tt0064949","tt0070634","tt0058155","tt0053085","tt0069024"]','["horror;Peter Cushing;Christopher Lee;Telly Savalas"]','[{"url":"/Horror_Express.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Horror_Express_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/Horror_Express_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','Horror_Express',366802,'Q649850','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Svyatogor and his horse become a mountain as he dies. Meanwhile, Asiatic pagans known as the Tugars are ravaging and pillaging the land. They raid the village where the bearded and robust Ilya Muromets lives and capture his future wife Vassilisa. Ilya is unable to defend her because his legs haven''t worked since childhood. A man called Mishatychka caught by the Tugars pleads to serve them if they spare him, and promises to be a double agent for them.  The pilgrims with Svyatogor''s sword come upon the house of Ilya Muromets and cure his ailment with a magical potion and a magical song.  They also give him the sword. Later on, he decides to leave his family to go on an epic journey in order to defend Kiev from the Tugars. For this purpose he is given a foal by a neighbour (Mikula Selyaninovich) which magically grows into a steed in three days. He passes by some woods and is confronted by a forest-dwelling monster known as Nightingale the Robber who blows wind so hard it parts the forest backward; Ilya defeats him by throwing a cudgel at him.
Meanwhile, in the capital Kiev, a peasant named Razumey stands trial before Knyaz Vladimir the Fair Sun, for cutting trees without permission. Upon hearing that Razumey''s purpose was designing and building weapons to use against the enemy, Vladimir releases him and provides him with wood to continue the work.
Ilya arrives in Kiev and presents the forest monster to Knyaz Vladimir, who is impressed with his deeds.  Ilya becomes part of a bogatyr brotherhood with two other bogatyrs Dobrynya Nikitich and Alyosha Popovich. A Tugar envoy arrives in the city, a huge zeppelin-like man on a massive moving platform, who warns the Knyaz to give a tribute for twelve years in advance and they will be spared.  Ilya replies by insulting the ambassador, and, when he throws a sword at Ilya, throwing it back into the ambassador''s stomach, cutting him down while the envoy runs off. Ilya leaves Kiev and finds Vassilisa captured by three Tugars and releases her. After a while Ilya departs from the pregnant Vassilisa to fight the Turgars. Upon leaving he expresses his wish for her to bear a son, to be called Sokolnichek (Little Falcon), who will become a heroic warrior.
Unfortunately Vassilisa is abducted again by the Tugars. Mishatychka has become an important adviser to the knyaz and he tricks the knyaz into believing that Ilya is disloyal to him. Ilya is imprisoned in the castle''s dungeons where he will eventually spend ten years deprived of food by Mishatychka.  Disgusted, Nikitich and Popovich leave the knyaz''s court. Mishatychka attempts to send the dungeon key to Kalin, but instead, it falls into Razumey''s hands. Vassilisa has born a son, Sokolnichek, while in captivity of Tsar Kalin, the Tugar Khan. Kalin adopts Sokolnichek as his own son and has him trained as a mighty Tugar warrior. The huge Tugar army sets up camp outside the city of Kiev, demanding an enormous ransom (700 carts of gold) to be given to Kalin in order for the city to be spared. Ilya is released, having survived on food provided by a magic table cloth that Vassilisa had woven previously. Mishatychka the traitor is rooted out and ordered to be boiled in pitch, while Vladimir calls out for all the Rus'' warriors to assemble for a battle the Tugar hordes. Nikitich and Popovich, hearing of Ilya''s release, hurry back into Kiev. Due to the reinforcements being slow to arrive, Ilya hatches a plan to trick Kalin by using torn sacks and broken carts to create the impression that all of the gold being paid as tribute fell out during transport, and then make Kalin think the warriors tried to keep the treasure for themselves. After they warriors give Kalin the treasure (their own jewelry), the king demands to give him Ilya as well. Ilya sends people to Kiev, and they naturally come back empty handed. Kalin then promises to depart if Ilya is delivered. Ilya reveals himself to Kalin who feels insulted by this deception, captures Ilya and decides to attack Kiev anyway; Ilya escapes and goes back to Kiev. With all the aforementioned manipulations, enough time has passed for the Rus'' armies to arrive.
Sokolnichek is now a strong Tugar warrior who is sent to fight Ilya. While they duel, Ilya sees the ring on his son''s finger and reveals his true heritage to him.  Abashed, he joins his father''s side and goes to free Vassilisa, together with all the Russians held captive by Kalin. Nikitich and Popovich each lead one army with Ilya leading the center army toward the Tugar hordes and Vladimir with his personal guard stands ready as reserve. The Khan orders a massive pyramid to be made out of human bodies so that he can survey the forthcoming battle. An arrow is shot from inside Kiev by a large ballista designed and operated by Razumey, causing Kalin to tumble down. Angry, Kalin orders to release the three-headed dragon, Zmey Gorynych, to help in the fight. Another arrow from the ballista hits the dragon in the wing, forcing it to fight on the ground. More of the Russian soldiers land from ships from a nearby river and fight the fire-breathing dragon, eventually slaying it. The Tugar hordes are routed and Kalin captured. The victorious Ilya is finally reunited with Vassilisa and offered a place at the court and a title by Vladimir, but declines in order to be with his wife and go on other journeys. He gives the title and his sword to his son, who continues the heroic lineage.','["Aleksandr Ptushko"]',NULL,'["Boris Andreyev","Shukur Burkhanov","Andrei Abrikosov"]','["Fantasy"]','5.5','["tt0046264","tt0062453","tt0057637","tt0174174","tt0403783","tt0083730","tt0167227","tt0080421","tt0053240","tt0218493","tt0050326","tt0025946"]','["Feature Films","fantasy","folklore","Russian","Aleksandr Ptushko","Joseph Harris","Sig Shore","Million Dollar Movie","pan and scan","dubbed","Marvin Miller","Paul Frees","Mike Wallace"]','[{"url":"/Sword and the Dragon_2.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/SwordAndTheDragon_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','SwordAndTheDragon',48199,'Q1658610','wp','["Mikhail Kochnev"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

One night, spoiled socialite Cornelia Bullock offers him $5 to be her "forgotten man" for a scavenger hunt. Annoyed, he advances on her, causing her to retreat and fall on a pile of ashes. She leaves in a fury, much to the glee of her younger sister Irene. After talking with her, Godfrey finds her to be kind and a bit scatter-brained. He offers to go with Irene to help her beat Cornelia.
In the ballroom of the Waldorf-Ritz Hotel, Irene''s long-suffering businessman father Alexander Bullock waits resignedly as his ditsy wife Angelica and her mooching protégé Carlo play the game. Godfrey arrives and is authenticated as a "forgotten man". He then addresses the crowd, expressing his contempt for their antics. Irene is apologetic and offers him a job as the family butler, which he gratefully accepts.
Godfrey is shown what to do by the Bullocks'' wise-cracking maid Molly. She warns him that he is merely the latest in a long line of butlers. Godfrey proves to be surprisingly competent. Cornelia holds a grudge against Godfrey, and Irene considers him her protégé.
Tommy Gray, a lifelong friend of Godfrey, recognizes him working at a tea party thrown by Irene. Godfrey quickly ad-libs that he was Tommy''s valet at Harvard. Tommy plays along, embellishing Godfrey''s story with a nonexistent wife and five children. Dismayed, Irene impulsively announces her engagement to the surprised Charlie Van Rumple, but she soon breaks down in tears and flees after being congratulated by Godfrey.
Over lunch the next day, Tommy is curious to know what one of the elite "Parkes of Boston" is doing as a servant. Godfrey explains that a broken love affair left him considering suicide, but the undaunted attitude of the men living at the dump rekindled his spirits. Cornelia has her boyfriend "Faithful George" call Tommy to the telephone, then she approaches Godfrey and attempts to negotiate a peace — but only on her terms. Godfrey declines.
Having failed to make Godfrey''s life miserable, Cornelia plants her pearl necklace under his mattress, then calls the police. When the police do not find the pearls in Godfrey''s suite, Mr. Bullock realizes his daughter has orchestrated the whole thing. He informs Cornelia she had better find her uninsured pearls.
The Bullocks send their daughters to Europe to get Irene away from her now-broken engagement. When they return, Cornelia implies that she intends to seduce Godfrey. Worried, Irene stages a fainting spell and falls into Godfrey''s arms. He carries her to her room, but realizes she is faking when he sees her reflection sit up briefly. In revenge, he puts her in a cold shower, which merely confirms her hopes: "Oh Godfrey, now I know you love me ... You do or you wouldn''t have lost your temper." Godfrey resigns as the Bullocks'' butler.
Mr. Bullock has more pressing concerns. He throws Carlo out, then announces to his family and Godfrey that his business is failing and he might face criminal charges. Godfrey interrupts with good news: He had sold short, using money raised by pawning Cornelia''s necklace, and used some of his profits to buy the stock that Bullock had sold. He gives the stock to the stunned Mr. Bullock, saving the family, then returns the necklace to a humbled Cornelia. Godfrey then leaves.
With his remaining profits and Tommy as a business partner, Godfrey builds The Dump, a fashionable nightclub, creating jobs for 50 people. A determined Irene finds him and bulldozes him into marriage, saying "Stand still, Godfrey.

In order to raise money, Muggs and the gang go to Nick (Charles Judels)''s pool hall and challenge hall regular Harry Wycoff (Gabriel Dell) to a game of pool. Muggs has pre-arranged with gang member Danny to use special trick chalk for the pool cue so that Wycoff will lose, but Danny (Bobby Jordan) is so convinced of Muggs''s talent that he does not use the chalk, and Muggs loses the match. When Wycoff insists that Muggs pay off his wager, Muggs hits him in the stomach and leaves without paying.
Seeking revenge, Wycoff plots with bookie Tony (Wheeler Oakman) to eliminate Muggs from the boxing match. The night of the match, Muggs is abducted by a man pretending to be a reporter (Ray Miller), who holds him hostage in the back of a car for the duration of the fight. When Muggs does not show up for the match, Danny goes into the ring so that the East Side Kids will not be disqualified. Although Danny is out of shape, he surprises everyone by winning the match.
After Muggs is released, he takes the championship belt from Danny and accuses him of arranging the kidnapping. Muggs continues to harass Danny after he learns that Danny has gotten a job at a garage where he had hoped to work, and that Danny has been dating his sister Ivy (Pamela Blake). When Danny learns about Wycoff''s involvement in Muggs'' kidnapping, he tries to tell Muggs, but Muggs ostracizes him from the club. Muggs learns from Scruno (Sunshine Sammy)''s father Jackson (Dudley Dickerson) that Wycoff works for Tony, who is also Jackson''s boss, and the East Side Kids start a brawl with Tony and his thugs. The Kids are arrested for disturbing the peace, but the judge (Minerva Urecal) releases them without a sentence, and gives Tony and his pals six-months jail time for bookmaking.
Later, Danny and Ivy compete in a jitterbug contest, but Muggs and his date (Kay Marvis) are declared the winners until the judge (Jack Chefe) discovers that Muggs'' partner is a professional dancer. Muggs is disqualified, and the fifty-dollar prize is awarded to Danny and Ivy. Danny reluctantly turns the money over to Muggs after he threatens him.

Danny bests Muggs in a fistfight, which alleviates the tensions between the two old friends.

The interviews with these artists reveal an emerging understanding of digital works and the obstacle to their authoring copyright presents.
The interviews featured in Good Copy Bad Copy acknowledge a recent shift towards user-generated content, mashup music and video culture. The documentary opens with explaining the current legal situation concerning sampling, licensing and copyright.
Good Copy Bad Copy documents the conflict between current copyright law and recent technological advances that enable the sampling of music, as well as the distribution of copyrighted material via peer-to-peer file sharing search engines such as The Pirate Bay. MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America) CEO Dan Glickman is interviewed in connection with a raid by the Swedish police against The Pirate Bay in May 2006. Glickman concedes that piracy will never be stopped, but states that they will try to make it as difficult and tedious as possible. Gottfrid Svartholm and Fredrik Neij from The Pirate Bay are also interviewed, with Neij stating that The Pirate Bay is illegal according to US law, but not Swedish law.
The interviews document attitudes towards art, culture and copyright in a number of countries, including the United States, Sweden, Russia, Nigeria, and Brazil.
The situation in Nigeria and Brazil is documented in terms of innovative business models that have developed in response to new technological possibilities and changing markets.
In Nigeria the documentary interviews individuals working within the Nigerian film industry, or Nollywood. Charles Igwe, a film producer in Lagos, is interviewed at length about his views on the Nigerian film industry, the nature of Nigerian films, and copyright in the context of digital video technology. Mayo Ayilaran, from the Copyright Society of Nigeria, explains the Nigerian government''s approach to copyright enforcement.
In Brazil the Tecno brega industry and its unique approach to copyright and sampling is documented, featuring interviews with amongst others Ronaldo Lemos, Professor of Law FGV Brazil. Lemos explains that CDs or recorded music is treated merely as an advertisement for parties and concerts that generate revenue.

A young man, Nick Richards, comes to town, claiming that the old tramp was his uncle. Alerted to his presence, the town''s sheriff informs Nick that his Uncle Pete was found dead of undetermined causes and no one in the town liked Pete. Everyone notices that even though it''s incredibly hot, the immaculately dressed Nick doesn''t so much as have a drop of sweat on him.
Nick proceeds to run a gas station which he uses as a base to do some petty interfering in the lives of a few locals, driving a wedge between Nell Lucas and David Simpson after Simpson''s dog attacks him and mauls his face. Nick Simpson seems to be behind all this, and further animal-related incidents occur - for instance, a local drunk is trampled by a horse, a plastic surgeon driving to Furnace Flats to do an operation on Simpson is killed in when a cow lays down in the road in front of his car that causes him to crash and a rattler gets in to attack Simpson in his bedroom. The sheriff goes to the shack and finds a buried goat that is dug up by his terrier.
Ultimately, Nick dies and transforms back into his human shape of Pete Jensen, having had it revealed that he was behind the various animal-inflicted maulings and killings as Pete had sold his soul for a period of two years and the Devil allowed Pete to come back to town to revenge himself on some of the townsfolk in the guise of a young man. At this point, David Simpson''s facial wound miraculously disappears and the film ends on a happy note with the townsfolk characters standing over Nick''s body in a field.','["Charles R.

The M.C. goes on to say that this film is the first of its kind and names it The Terror of Tiny Town. Then walks on stage the hero, Buck Larson, who interrupts the emcee, telling him that the story is serious as he is the hero and will become the biggest star in Hollywood. The villain of the film, Bat Haines, comes on stage to say that he will be the biggest star in Hollywood. The two then proceed to argue and try to fight each other. The emcee breaks them up and lets the film proceed.
The townspeople are at work while singing Laugh Your Troubles Away. Buck Larson''s father, Pop Larson, tells Buck that he wants him to go to the ranch and find out why the calves are disappearing. Bat Haines and his gang are seen roping the calves while riding Shetland ponies. Buck spots the cattle rustlers, and they run off before he can see them up close. The rustlers plant a branding iron with the initials of a neighboring rancher, Tex Preston. Meanwhile, Bat tells Tex that the Larsons are shooting his cattle.
Later Tex goes to town to retrieve his niece, Nancy Preston, who was orphaned and will now live with her uncle. In the town saloon Bat tells the sheriff to stay out of the Larson and Preston feud or he will be sent back to the jail. He also reveals that he will rob a stagecoach carrying money.

She turns down his marriage proposal because she is married to a Foreign Legion officer named Francois (Reginald Gardiner). Heartbroken, Ollie contemplates suicide. He is joined by his friend Stan in sinking himself into a river. (In some versions this proceeding is complicated by the presence of an "escaped shark".) Stan repeatedly interrupts Ollie as he is about to throw the weight in, and asks him to consider the possibility of reincarnation. Ollie decides his preference is to be reincarnated as a horse. Francois catches sight of them and convinces them to enlist in the Foreign Legion in order to forget Ollie''s failed romance. When Stan asks how long it will take Ollie to forget, Francois says it will only take a matter of a few days.
The commandant (Charles B. Middleton) introduces Ollie and Stan to their daily legionnaire duties, for which their daily wage is 100 centimes, which, translated into American currency amounts to only three cents. Ollie and Stan attempt to negotiate for a higher wage. For this uppity attitude they are sentenced to menial labor, washing and ironing a mountain of laundry, with legion officers constantly on their backs. Finally and ''miraculously'', Ollie forgets his broken romance completely. His and Stan''s purpose in joining the Foreign Legion fulfilled, they abandon their task, discarding the still hot iron, which unintentionally sets the laundry pile aflame. Angered by the hard work and low pay of the Foreign Legion, Ollie writes the commander an insulting farewell letter and signs it.
They meet Georgette again. Ollie, delighted that she has seemingly changed her mind and come back to him, proceeds to embrace and kiss her. Francois arrives, informs him that Georgette is his wife and warns him to stay away from her. After Francois leaves, the commandant appears and, having discovered their farewell note and the mountain of burning laundry, pronounces them under arrest for desertion. They are taken to the prison, locked up and sentenced to be shot at dawn. Stan amazes Ollie by playing "The World Is Waiting for the Sunrise" on the bedsprings. As he is about to play another piece, the jailor yells at them to be quiet. Later in the evening, someone throws a note that says they can escape by means of a tunnel leading from their cell to the outside wall. Stan brings on an accidental cave-in which causes the underground path to lead to Francois and Georgette''s dwelling. The whole legion engages in hot pursuit of the boys, who flee to a nearby hangar and hide out in an airplane, which Stan accidentally starts up. The boys fly it until it crashes. Stan emerges unharmed from the crash, but Ollie has died, seen ascending into Heaven. However, Stan later bumps into Ollie, reincarnated as a horse in accordance with the wish he expressed during his aborted suicide attempt. Stan is elated to find his friend alive, but Ollie grumpily remarks, "Well, here`s another nice mess you`ve gotten me into."','["A.

He plays the organ while his children helpers from all over the world sing. Meanwhile, in Hell, Lucifer instructs his chief demon Pitch to travel to Earth and turn the children of the world against Santa.
In a busy marketplace, Pitch attempts to convince five children to "make Santa Claus angry": Lupita, a poor girl; Billy, the son of wealthy but negligent parents; and three troublemaking brothers. Pitch fails at convincing Lupita to steal a doll from a vendor, but succeeds in convincing the brothers to break a shop window. Santa''s child workers alert him to these events.
Unable to travel to Earth before nightfall on Christmas Eve, he instead uses equipment to watch Pitch and the children. One device allows him to view Lupita''s dream, induced by Pitch, in which she is tormented by life-sized dancing dolls who entice her to steal. He also listens as the three brothers plot to break into Billy''s home and steal his presents. They also attempt to write a letter to Santa claiming they have been good, but Santa''s voice informs them that he can see all that they do.
Merlin the wizard, Santa''s most trusted assistant, gives Santa a sleep inducing powder and a flower that allows him to disappear. He then retrieves a magic key that will open any door on Earth from Vulcan and prepares his mechanical reindeer. On Earth, the three rude boys plot to capture and enslave Santa. Meanwhile, Lupita and her mother say a prayer and Lupita says that she has wished for two dolls, one of which she will give to the Baby Jesus.
During Santa''s journey, Pitch makes several unsuccessful attempts to sabotage Santa''s delivery of toys in Mexico City. Santa succeeds in reuniting Billy with his parents, who had left him alone to go to a restaurant. On a city rooftop, the three brothers prepare to capture Santa and steal his toys. They see Santa''s sleigh in the sky and hurry indoors, only to find that they have received coal. After a failed attempt to steal the sleigh, Pitch succeeds in emptying Santa''s dream powder bag while Santa drops the disappearing flower.
Santa''s trip is nearly complete when he is chased by a vicious dog outside a large house in Mexico. Finding himself without the powder or the flower, he climbs a tree to escape the dog. Pitch appears and proceeds to wake the household and calls the fire department to report a fire at that location, so that Santa will soon be seen by many people. With dawn approaching, Merlin assists with a last-minute escape and Pitch is defeated after being doused with the spray from a fire hose.
Before returning to the castle Santa makes one final stop, leaving a doll for Lupita. His labors now completed, Santa steers the sleigh back to the castle, content in the knowledge that he has brought happiness to all of Earth''s children.','["René Cardona"]','["Adolfo Torres Portillo","René Cardona"]','["José Elías Moreno","Cesáreo Quezadas ''Pulgarcito''","José Luis Aguirre ''Trotsky''"]','["Comedy","Family","Fantasy","Horror"]','2.6','["tt0058548","tt0066328","tt1129407","tt0060236","tt0085231","tt2490352","tt2665200","tt1327788","tt0425468","tt0257484","tt0100173","tt1663628"]','["Santa Claus; christmas"]','[{"url":"/SantaClaus_1.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/SantaClaus_1_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/SantaClausversusTheDevil_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','SantaClausversusTheDevil',34068,'Q1931267','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Undeterred from financing Randall, but lacking the cash, Barbara decides to trade in her expensive car for a very cheap one.
While she is out on a test drive with a salesman, her car is fraudulently sold by con man "Con" Cornelius (Berton Churchill) who is loitering around the car yard. The buyer, Jerry Bassett (Chick Chandler), is a Penfield Company laundry worker who has just quit after winning best employee award and $1,000. He sets out for the Royal Valley holiday resort and on the road picks up Barbara who, after the cheap car broke down, is hitchhiking to a rendezvous there with Randall. She does not recognize her own car which Bassett is driving, and introduces herself using the false name Beatrice Payne.
Arriving at the Royal Valley, Bassett and "Beatrice" book into separate rooms. Later Cornelius and his daughter Prudence arrive. Bassett learns that Beatrice is really Barbara Penfield, the daughter of his ex-employer, and it is confirmed when Penfield himself arrives to put a stop to any further negotiation between her and Randall.
Several cases of mistaken identity result between Penfield, Randall, Cornelius, and Bassett, with almost everyone believing the other is rich and manoeuvering to make a deal with him.

Abner decides to build a chemistry lab in his own basement. Soon he develops a new improved formula for manufacturing synthetic rubber. His partner Lum Edwards wants them to go to Washington D.C. To present their work to Marshall.
When the two men arrive in Washington, they have a hard time finding housing for their stay. They are offered lodging by an unknown man they meet in a park, but it turns out the room they are given is the bedroom display in a department store window. As they wake up in the morning, they are chased out of the store, but encounter an old friend of theirs who is a newspaper columnist, Robert Blevine.
Robert invites them to stay at his house instead, and accompanies them to see Marshall. They have to wait in line to see him though, since hoards of people have gathered for the same reason. Robert is scolded by Marshall''s secretary because of his harsh articles in the paper about him, while Abner and Lum go see the sights around the city.
While resting on a park bench, Lum listens to a conversation a senator has with another man, about drought problems in his state. Lum interrupts the conversation and advises the senator to plant worms to remedy the soil. Lum goes on to advise a congressman on stopping migration from small-towns to the big cities.
Lum and Abner develop quite the reputation around Washington, and word gets around that they are great consultants. They get a lot of visitors wanting to get their advice right there on the park bench. After a while Marshall shows up by the bench, and the two men show him their rubber invention. He is very pleased with their discovery and calls for an immediate press conference.
During the press conference, Abner is hit in the head by a falling statue, and knocked unconscious. When he wakes up again, he has lost his near memory and forgotten his rubber formula. The press doesn''t believe he ever had a working formula and Marshall is publicly humiliated. Marshall gets an ultimatum, to produce Abner''s formula in a week or he will lose his job.
Marshall decides to accompany Lum and Abner home to Pine Ridge, to try to extract the formula from Abner in his home environment. Abner ultimately gets his memory back as he hits his head once again, and finally remembers the formula on the last day of the ultimatum deadline.
Both Lum and Abner are rewarded for their great service to the country, and appointed heads of a special committee on farming problems and Marshall''s reputation is restored.','["Ray McCarey"]','["Roswell Rogers","Edward James"]','["Chester Lauck","Norris Goff","Alan Mowbray"]','["Comedy"]','5.5','["tt0033379","tt0035480","tt0032417","tt0035982","tt0035757","tt0035888","tt0035993","tt0036386"]','["Comedy"]','[{"url":"/so_this_is_washington.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/so_this_is_washington_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/so_this_is_washington_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','so_this_is_washington',18814,'Q7549558','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

For instance, the film uses such scenes as superimposing a shot of a cameraman setting up his camera atop a second, mountainous camera, superimposing a cameraman inside a beer glass, filming a woman getting out of bed and getting dressed, even filming a woman giving birth, and the baby being taken away to be bathed.
Vertov''s message about the prevalence and unobtrusiveness of filming was not yet true – cameras might have been able to go anywhere, but not without being noticed; they were too large to be hidden easily and too noisy to remain hidden anyway.  To get footage using a hidden camera, Vertov and his brother Mikhail Kaufman (the film''s co-author) had to distract the subject with something else even louder than the camera filming them.
The film also features a few obvious stagings such as the scene of a woman getting out of bed and getting dressed and the shot of chess pieces being swept to the center of the board (a shot spliced in backwards so the pieces expand outward and stand in position). The film was criticized for both the stagings and the stark experimentation, possibly as a result of its director''s frequent assailing of fiction film as a new "opiate of the masses".','["Dziga Vertov"]',NULL,NULL,'["Documentary","Music"]','8.4','["tt0015648","tt0020530","tt0013427","tt0019254","tt0010323","tt0000417","tt0024844","tt0031885","tt0015361","tt0018455","tt0015064","tt0018217"]','["Silent; Documentary"]','[{"url":"/Chelovek_s_kino-apparatom_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/ChelovekskinoapparatomManWithAMovieCamera_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','ChelovekskinoapparatomManWithAMovieCamera',218207,'Q829250','wp','["Dziga Vertov"]',NULL,'["Mikhail Kaufman"]',NULL,NULL,NULL),

The earl sends his lawyer Havisham (Henry Stephenson) to bring Ceddie to England. As the earl''s sons are all dead, Ceddie is the only remaining heir to the title. Mrs. Errol accompanies her son to England, but is not allowed to live at Dorincourt castle. For Cedric''s happiness, she does not tell him it is because of his grandfather''s bigotry. The earl''s lawyer is impressed with the young widow''s wisdom. However, the earl expresses skepticism when Mr. Havisham informs him that Cedric''s mother will not accept an allowance from him.
Cedric soon wins the hearts of his stern grandfather and everyone else. The earl hosts a grand party to proudly introduce his grandson to British society, notably his sister Lady Constantia Lorridaile (Constance Collier).
After the party, Havisham informs the earl that Cedric is not the heir apparent after all. American Minna Tipton (Helen Flint) insists her son Tom (Jackie Searl) is the offspring of her late husband, the earl''s eldest son. Heartbroken, the earl accepts her apparently valid claim, though Tom proves to be a rather obnoxious lad.
Ceddie''s friend Dick Tipton (Mickey Rooney) recognises Minna from her newspaper picture. He takes his brother Ben, Tom''s real father, to England and disproves Minna''s claim. The earl apologises to Ceddie''s mother and invites her to live with the delighted Ceddie on his estate.','["John Cromwell"]','["Frances Hodgson Burnett","Hugh Walpole"]','["Freddie Bartholomew","Dolores Costello","C.

Kagle ends up in Hell, where "Nick" offers him a chance to leave and avenge his own death in exchange for help with a problem. Kagle looks exactly like Judge Frederick Parker, an upright man who is causing Nick distress because he is entirely too honest. Nick fears that Parker may cause him more anxiety in future, as he is running for governor of his state. Nick wants to destroy Parker''s reputation and Kagle readily agrees to have his soul transferred into Parker''s body.
As soon as Kagle appears as Parker, odd things begin to happen. Kagle pursues his goal with evil intent (though often at cross purposes with the Devil), but everything he does to ruin Judge Parker''s reputation somehow results in making Parker look better. Along the way, Kagle falls in love with Barbara Foster, the judge''s fiancée, causing him to question his whole outlook on life and eventually rebel against Nick.
Nick presents Kagle the opportunity to shoot Williams, but instead Kagle confronts the man with the truth. Shocked and frightened, Williams backs away and falls out an open window to his death.
Exasperated and defeated, Nick takes Kagle back to Hell, leaving Judge Parker in a much better position than before. Nick threatens to make the reformed Kagle''s punishment even more painful than usual, but Kagle blackmails his would-be tormentor; in return for not revealing Nick''s blunders, Kagle wants to be made a trustee. Nick has no option but to agree to the demand.','["Archie Mayo"]','["Harry Segall","Harry Segall"]','["Paul Muni","Anne Baxter","Claude Rains"]','["Adventure","Comedy","Fantasy","Romance"]','6.8','["tt0037618","tt0052990","tt0039211","tt0035746","tt0024785","tt0039288","tt0039757","tt0025129","tt0029581","tt0038782","tt0080371","tt0026129"]','["Comedy"]','[{"url":"/angel_on_my_shoulder.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/angel_on_my_shoulder_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/angel_on_my_shoulder_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','angel_on_my_shoulder',224447,'Q1770219','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The derelict seizes Reno''s hand, causing him and Carol to flee from the church, unknown to him that the derelict contained a paper with Reno''s information, requesting a meeting with him. Reno denies knowing who the derelict was.
Later, at his apartment, Reno receives a large Con-Ed electricity bill, the phone bill and cannot pay his rent. He shares an apartment with Carol, a former flight attendant, and her drug-addicted lover Pamela, in a derelict-filled neighbourhood in Union Square. Reno visits Dalton, an art gallery owner, and tells him that he is currently painting a masterpiece. Reno asks for a week''s extension and a loan of $500 to cover the rent; however, Dalton refuses, saying that he has already lent enough money to Reno. However, if Reno finishes a satisfactory painting in one week, Dalton will buy it for the necessary amount.
The following day, a No Wave band entitled the Roosters begin practising their music in a nearby apartment, in which the music makes Reno unnerved and frustrated. At 2:00 in the morning, Reno becomes more agitated from the Roosters'' music while painting. After seeing his own image saturated in blood, Reno walks the streets in the dark. He sees an elderly derelict sleeping in a garbage-strewn alley, where he grabs the bum and begins ranting. Reno ducks with the bum into the alley where they see a small group of teenage gang members chasing another homeless bum down the street. When the gang members are gone from sight, Reno drops the bum to the ground and walks away, vowing that he will not end up like a derelict.
The next day, Reno complains about the Roosters to their landlord. However, the landlord refuses to act because the music does not bother him (implying that the band bribes him to ignore their loud music). He gives Reno a skinned rabbit for dinner, but instead demands the rent money. Reno takes the rabbit home and repeatedly stabs it while preparing it. During a brief reprieve from the music, Reno mentally hears voices calling his name and sees an image of an eyeless Carol. That night, Reno leaves outside and armed with a power drill connected to a portable battery pack. He discovers another derelict inside an abandoned building and brutally kills him. The following evening, Reno, Carol and Pamela see Tony Coca-Cola and the Roosters at a nightclub. As the Roosters play, Reno becomes irritated by the music and crowd and leaves while Carol and Pamela dance and kiss.

Reno returns to his apartment, grabs his drill and goes out on a killing spree. Throughout the night, Reno kills a number of homeless bums all over the city before returning home to sleep. Later, Tony visits Reno''s apartment and asks Reno to paint a portrait of him, in which Tony agrees to pose for Reno''s demand of $500 rent bill. As Reno paints, Tony poses by playing his guitar and kissing Pamela. A derelict in a nearby alley (upset by the noise) is later attacked and killed by Reno. Afterwards, Reno completes his painting, where he then wakes and notifies Pamela and Carol.
The next day, Reno and Carol show the painting to Dalton who leaves after declaring it "unacceptable" and Carol yells at Reno for sitting with a blank facial expression, resulting her leaving Reno for her ex-husband Stephen by the next morning. That evening, Reno calls Dalton and invites him to see another painting. When Dalton arrives as the Roosters are practising, a dressed-up Reno kills him with his drill. After visiting the Roosters, Pamela returns to the apartment where, upon the discovery of Dalton''s body inside, she flees into the hallway before Reno grabs her. Pamela''s fate is left ambiguous.
Across town, Carol is back with Stephen at his apartment. She takes a shower while Stephen prepares tea. Reno enters the apartment, kills Stephen, and then hides his body behind a kitchen counter. Carol, exiting from her shower, walks to the bedroom where Reno hides under the bed covers.

Sutton and Tex find that the ranch guests all have alibis. Soon the mysterious cloaked figure strikes again, shooting young John, attacking Sutton, and slashing Flora''s throat. While the investigation continues, Jim, who is apparently an invalid, takes a turn for the worse, prompting Sutton to contact his ex-wife who hasn''t been to the ranch in thirty years.
Mrs. Ballard arrives at the ranch, Mrs. Borg tries to prevent her from seeing her ailing ex-husband. Sutton arrives and helps her upstairs where she discover that "Jim" is actually Adolph Borg, and that he and his wife had killed the real Jim Ballard sometime earlier during a takeover attempt by the Borg family. Adolph then tricks Sutton and escapes, taking Rita as a hostage. Sutton follows them to the mine where he fights with Adolph and John, nearly being crushed by the stamp mill. After Adolph falls to his death, Sutton rescues Rita. Afterwards, Mrs. Borg, her son John, and their Chinese servant Ling Yat are sentenced to twenty years in prison, and Tex is made sheriff. Larry and Rita get married and buy a ranch in Hawaii.','["Charles Barton"]','["Edward E.

The attempt fails, and in charge of handing in the petition is Cassie''s nephew Garson Denham, a lawyer. Instead he summons a newspaper reporter, Bob White (Wallace Ford), and his girlfriend, Nora O''Brien (Marian Marsh), and tells them he has been invited to stay a week at Cassie''s estate up in the mountains.
The invitation states that any relative not arriving at the specified time will be excluded from the will. Garson believes his aunt is mentally unsound and plans to kill them all during the stay. Despite this Garson and his wife, his brothers Tom and Larry and their mother Martha keep the appointment.
As they arrive Cassie tells them that they are there so that she can learn which one of them should inherit the bulk of her fortune. She also tells them that she keeps all of her money at the house.
That night Garson is stabbed to death in the library. Bob and Nora receive the news of his death and show up at the estate with a photographer to write about the killing. Sheriff Boggs is already questioning everyone at the house about their whereabouts during the night, and Bob, Nora and the photographer are all invited to stay at the estate by Cassie.
The next night, Larry is killed in the library, and the sheriff continues his investigation. The dead bodies disappear and turn up again in Bob''s closet, but they disappear before he is able to show them to the others.
Later, Eddie sees the bookshelf in the library open revealing a secret doorway and as Cassie comes out from one side, he walks in via the reverse side of the bookshelf, unseen by her, into a secret passage. Cassie asks Eddie to guard a small box with her valuables, offering him $10,000 to do so, and says she suspects her neighbor, Trowbridge Montrose, of being involved in the killings. The neighbor is supposedly in love with Cassie.
Tom is the next stabbed whilst he is talking to Mary in the garden. However, the assailant is unknown as everyone present at the property appears to possess an alibi for the time of the attack. Cassie is determined to catch the killer and tells Bob of a plan she has, saying she will see to it that everyone is outside and then set the house on fire to see who tries to run in and save the money within from destruction.
When the house is in flames, Mary, Cassie''s house servant, suddenly panics and angrily confronts her employer, stating that she should have the money for working for her for several years and tolerating her imperiousness, saying she was entitled to inherit something, and hysterically admits committing the murders, implicating also her accomplice, Michael, the chauffeur, whom she has secretly married. She is arrested, and after a chase through the woods the chauffeur is also apprehended by Bob armed with a revolver.
Trowbridge then proposes to Cassie; Eddie presents the box to Cassie and gets his money, but the twist in the tale is that it turns out to be old Confederate States of America currency, and quite worthless. Cassie then reveals that all of her ''fortune'' is in the same denomination, but Trowbridge announces that it is unimportant as he has enough for them both to live upon. The film ends with Bob also getting the girl in the form of Nora.','["Phil Rosen"]',NULL,'["Wallace Ford","Marian Marsh","Sarah Padden"]','["Adventure","Comedy","Crime","Mystery","Thriller"]','6.2','["tt0035679","tt0034850","tt0025566","tt0035171","tt0024382","tt0027501","tt0021647","tt0029028","tt0025169","tt0033760","tt0039815","tt0022173"]','["murder;mystery;Monogram Pictures;Wallace Ford;Dave O''Brien"]','[{"url":"/Murder_by_Invitation_1941.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/Murder_by_Invitation_1941_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/Murder_by_Invitation_1941_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/Murder_by_Invitation_576x432.mp4","format":"h.264"}]','Murder_by_Invitation_1941',26780,'Q6937729','wp','["George Bricker"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

He is particularly fond of his grandson Julio (Rudolph Valentino), with whom he often carouses at seedy dives in the Boca district of Buenos Aires. In one of these bars, the movie''s famous tango sequence occurs. A man and a woman (Beatrice Dominguez) are dancing the tango. Julio strides up and asks to cut in. The woman stares at Julio alluringly. The man brushes him off, and they resume dancing. Julio then challenges the man and strikes him, knocking him into some tables and out of the scene. Julio and the woman then dance a dramatic version of the tango that brings cheers from the people in the establishment. Following the dance, the woman sits on Julio''s lap. Madariaga then slides to the floor, drunk. The woman laughs at Madariaga. Julio casts her aside in scorn and helps his grandfather home.
Sometime later, Madariaga dies. The extended family breaks up, one half returning to Germany and the other to France.
In Paris, Julio enjoys a somewhat shiftless life as a would-be artist and sensation at the local tea dances. He falls in love with Marguerite Laurier (Alice Terry), the unhappy and much younger wife (by an arranged marriage) of Etienne Laurier, a friend of Julio''s father. The affair is discovered, and Marguerite''s husband agrees to give her a divorce to avoid a scandal. It seems as though Julio and Marguerite will be able to marry, but both end up getting caught up in the start of the Great War.

Marguerite becomes a nurse in Lourdes. The bravery of Etienne is reported, and he is blinded in battle. Etienne happens to end up at the hospital where she is working, and  Marguerite attends to him there. Julio travels to Lourdes to see Marguerite and instead sees her taking care of Etienne. Julio, ashamed of his wastrel life, enlists in the French Army.
In the meantime, the German Army overruns Julio''s father Marcelo''s Marne Valley castle in the First Battle of the Marne. Marcelo is forced to host a German general and staff in the castle. One of Marcelo''s three German nephews is amongst the staff and tries to protect him, but Marcelo is arrested after a melee involving an officer''s assault of a woman. Marcello is to be executed in the morning, but his life is spared when the French Army counterattacks in the "Miracle of the Marne". The castle is destroyed by the French counterattack.
Four years later Julio has survived and become renowned for his bravery in the trenches at the front. During a mission in no man''s land, he encounters his last surviving German cousin. Moments later, they are both killed by a shell. Back in Paris, Marguerite considers abandoning the blinded Etienne, but Julio''s ghost guides her to continue her care for him.
The ending scene shows Marcelo Desnoyers mourning over his son''s grave. The man who lived upstairs from Julio watches over him. Marcelo asks him, "Did you know my son?" The man, with a remorseful expression, lifts his arms, forming the shape of a cross with his body, and says "I knew them all!" He then points to the sky and shows Marcelo the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse riding away into the clouds. With this, the man assures him that "Peace has come—but the Four Horsemen will still ravage humanity—stirring unrest in the world—until all hatred is dead and only love reigns in the heart of mankind."','["Rex Ingram"]','["Vicente Blasco Ibáñez","June Mathis"]','["Rudolph Valentino","Alice Terry","Pomeroy Cannon"]','["Drama","Romance","War"]','7.2','["tt0012675","tt0017416","tt0012952","tt0012068","tt0012938","tt0012532","tt0011841","tt0011439","tt0015772","tt0012763","tt0012494","tt0012752"]','["Valentino; WWI; Epic; MGM; Silent"]','[{"url":"/FourHorsemenOfTheApocalypse.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/FourHorsemenOfTheApocalypse_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/FourHorsemenOfTheApocalypse_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','FourHorsemenOfTheApocalypse',30941,'Q1219825','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The U-boat evades the RCN and RCAF patrols by moving north. A raiding party of six Kriegsmarine sailors are put ashore to obtain supplies but soon after, the U-boat is sunk in Hudson Bay by RCAF bombers. The six attempt to evade capture by travelling across Canada to reach the neutral United States and return to Germany.
Led by Lieutenants Hirth (Eric Portman) and Kuhnecke (Raymond Lovell), the small band of sailors encounter and sometimes brutalise a wide range of people. The band steadily diminishes as one by one they are killed or captured. Initial victims of the Kriegsmarine sailors are the Eskimo Nick (Ley On) and a French-Canadian trapper (Laurence Olivier). When a floatplane is dispatched to investigate the reports of their arrival at a Hudson''s Bay Company trading post, the Germans open fire, gunning down the pilot and some of the local Inuit. The Kriegsmarine sailors steal the aircraft and take off to fly south, but can''t achieve takeoff because of being overloaded, the crew is told to get rid of all their rifles. One sailor exits and stands on a float to throw out the guns and in so doing, is shot and killed by an Inuk (a member of the Inuit) thereby unloading a sufficient amount of weight to takeoff.The floatplane runs out of fuel and crashes in a lake in Manitoba, killing Kuhnecke. The Germans encounter and are welcomed by a nearby Hutterite farming community. The Kriegsmarine sailors assume them to be sympathetic to the German cause, but Hirth''s fanatical speech is rejected by Peter (Anton Walbrook), the community''s leader, and even by one of the fugitives, Vogel (Niall MacGinnis), who comes to the aid of Anna (Glynis Johns), a teenage girl. Vogel, who would rather join the community and ply his trade of baker, is tried by Hirth and summarily executed for desertion.
The dwindling band arrive in Winnipeg and sell some field glasses for food. Hearing that the police are watching the border, Hirth decides they will travel to Vancouver to catch a steamship for neutral Japan. Knocking out or murdering a motorist for his car, Hirth, Lohrmann and Kranz flee west, having killed eleven civilians in all. Kranz is arrested by Canadian Mounties at a parade at Banff, Alberta. The two remaining men try to walk across the Rockies. They are welcomed at a camp by a writer named Philip Armstrong Scott (Leslie Howard) who takes them for lost tourists, but they turn on him, destroying his books and his very valuable paintings before fleeing. Scott and his men pursue them. Lohrmann finally rebels against Hirth''s leadership, knocks him out and takes off by himself. Lohrmann is cornered in a cave. Scott is shot, but enters the cave and beats him up, counting out loud the individual blows, each one in recompense for the loss of his two paintings, a Matisse and a Picasso; three books, including his own widely researched but as yet unpublished manuscript; and finally for his own wounds and temporary imprisonment. One of the other men in his party comments, as they all drag his body from the cave, "The boss has knocked him clear out!"
Hirth is the last fugitive. The story comes to a head with a confrontation between him and Andy Brock (Raymond Massey), a Canadian soldier who is absent without leave, aboard the baggage and express car of a Canadian National Railways train near the Canadian-American border. When Hirth learns that the train has crossed into the United States at Niagara Falls, he surrenders his gun to a U.S. Customs official and demands to be taken to the German embassy. Brock explains that Hirth is wanted in Canada for murder, but while the U.S. border guards are sympathetic to Brock''s plea, they cannot find any official reason to send Hirth back. When Brock points out that Hirth is not listed on the freight manifest, the Americans are happy to use this pretext to send the car, along with Hirth and Brock, back to Canada for "improperly manifested cargo". The film ends with the train''s reversing to Canada, and Brock, who had recently been knocked cold and had his uniform and dog tags stolen off his unconscious body, and donned by Hirth, who was planning on impersonating Brock within Canada, about to pummel Hirth in the baggage car.','["Michael Powell"]','["Emeric Pressburger","Rodney Ackland"]','["Leslie Howard","Laurence Olivier","Raymond Massey"]','["Drama","Thriller","War"]','7.3','["tt0036695","tt0035153","tt0037800","tt0041886","tt0036112","tt0034734","tt0031968","tt0049357","tt0044103","tt0034891","tt0038733","tt0034027"]','["action dramas; war dramas; WW2; all-star casts; Laurence Olivier; Glynis Johns; Leslie Howard; Raymond Massey"]','[{"url":"/49thParallelVideoQualityUpgrade.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/49thParallelVideoQualityUpgrade_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','49thParallelVideoQualityUpgrade',33964,'Q1620394','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Gemmler (Hans Heinrich von Twardowski) is in need of a powerful chemical formula to improve the energy output of ordinary gasoline. In his quest for this formula he finds two individuals that are of use: the chemist and playboy Tom Fielding (William Bakewell) and his co-worker, Robert Norton (Michael Whalen), who is engaged to Tom''s sister Nancy (Anne Nagel). They are already involved in such a project for another employer. Using his secret agents, Gemmler kidnaps them.
The unsuspecting Tom goes to the nearby Alpine-style tavern one night and meets a Polish refugee named Linda Pavlo (Constance Worth). They strike up a conversation, and the following morning Tom is late for work. Robert tells him to stay away from unknown women he meets at the bar by chance like that – nothing good will come out of it. The president of the chemical company where they work, Franklyn Prescott (C. Montague Shaw), gets a visit from a government agent, James Curtis (Jack Mulhall), and is told that there has been a double murder in another chemical plant. Prescott is not worried, but refers to his security plan: the plant is only working on one half of the precious formula, while another plant on the East Coast is working on the other half. Curtis breaks the news to Prescott that the East Coast plant has been compromised and sabotaged by one of its own chemists (George Pembroke) who stole half of the formula, now identified as working for the Nazis under the name of Karl Schmidt.
In the night, when Tom and Robert return to the same tavern as the night before, Curtis'' agents follow them there. Tom meets Linda again, and since she is actually a Nazi agent he is lured into a room where Gemmler is waiting. Gemmler threatens to hurt both Tom''s mother and his sister Nancy if they do not play along and give him the formula. When Tom leaves the tavern that night, he is again followed by one of Curtis'' agents, but one of Gemmler''s spies murders the agent.
The following day Prescott and Curtis talk to Robert, explaining their theory that Tom, in an act of treason, has murdered the agent. Robert does not buy it, claiming Tom is innocent. What none of them are aware of is that Tom''s sister Nancy is eavesdropping on their conversation. After Prescott and Curtis has left, Tom and Robert talk about what''s going on; later that night Tom meets once more with Linda at the bar. This time she offers him $100,000 in exchange for the formula.
After Tom''s meeting with Linda, he, Robert and Nancy team up to try to frame the Nazi spies and get rid of them once and for all. Tom goes to the chemical plant to retrieve the formula, and gives it tor Robert. He in turn brings the formula to his meeting with Linda and is escorted to Gemmler''s office. Suddenly, Tom appears at Gemmler''s office and starts arguing over the payment. This results in Gemmler withholding payment entirely. Robert is knocked out cold by Gemmler''s goons. The spies bring Tom with them to the airport, where Gemmler''s contact, Karl Schmidt, is about to arrive.
The government agents have followed Tom and his party, but are too late to catch Gemmler before he leaves for the airport. They do, however, arrest Linda and a few other spies lingering at Gemmler''s office. At the airport, Gemmler forces Tom into the aircraft and it takes off. Schmidt decides to test the formula while they are in mid air. Tom, who knows that the future of his country is at stake, makes a deliberate mistake in mixing the chemical ingredients. The aircraft explodes, leaving no survivors, with Tom sacrificing himself to prevent the formula from reaching its destination.','["Albert Herman"]',NULL,'["Michael Whalen","Anne Nagel","William Bakewell"]','["Action","Drama","Mystery"]','4.5','["tt0035755","tt0064135","tt0035614","tt0062819","tt0034538","tt0035958","tt0062807","tt0037449","tt0036397","tt0036398","tt0061693","tt0036161"]','["nazi; espionage; WWII; propaganda; chemist; secret formula; mata hari; Poverty Row; Producers Releasing Corporation; Anne Nagel; Michael Whalen; Albert Herman; Arthur St. Claire"]','[{"url":"/DawnExpress_1942_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/dawn-express.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/dawn-express_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','DawnExpress_1942',17006,'Q7729128','wp','["Arthur St. Claire"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

As there is no agreement, Androcles King of Thebes seeks the assistance of his friend, the legendary Hercules. Hercules, now married to Deianira with a son named Hylas, does not wish to leave the comfort of his family, though Hylas is keen for adventure.
Androcles takes matters into his own hands by drugging and kidnapping Hercules and placing him aboard a ship manned by a disreputable collection of former slaves and criminals.  The only members of the expedition Androcles can trust are his sidekick, Timoteo the dwarf and Hylas who has to hide below deck from Hercules lest he face his wrath for leaving home.  Rather than being angry, Hercules merely lazes away on deck without offering any assistance.
When the supply of fresh water is sabotaged, the ship lands on an island to replenish their supply.  The crew mutinies by attacking Androcles but Hercules turns the tide.  The crew is left stranded on the island, however, Hercules discovers Hylas on board.
Continuing their voyage, a storm wrecks the ship and separates all of them.  Hercules sees a vision of Androcles begging for his help.  Coming ashore on a mist-shrouded island he sees a woman held captive: not only chained to a cliff but gradually becoming a part of the rock formation.  When he rescues her he has to fight Proteus a god able to change form into various creatures.  Defeating Proteus, Hercules discovers the woman he rescued is Princess Ismene, daughter of Antinea, the Queen of Atlantis, where he has landed.  Hercules soon discovers his son Hylas and Timoteo and bring the rescued Princess to Antinea.
Though welcomed at first, Ismene discovers that she has been selected for sacrifice: a prophecy foretells that if she is not killed Atlantis and its population will be destroyed. The death of Proteus has already stripped Atlantis of its protective fog that keeps it unseen by the outside world. Ismene is recaptured and taken for execution. Antinea denies all knowledge of Androcles; his memory has been taken away and he is hidden from his friends.  During a celebration, Hercules discovers that children are selected and taken away from their parents for an unknown reason.
Things fall into place when Hercules and his companions not only rescue Ismene but a large group of prisoners in a pit.  The rescued prisoners explain that children are taken to a special stone that either transforms them either into blond supermen or disfigures the weak ones who are then placed in the pit. A priest explains that the stone is made from the blood of Uranus. The power of Uranus''s stone has created Antinea an invincible army of black-uniformed blond supermen with which she plans to conquer the world.
The rescued prisoners attack Antinea''s palace but all are killed by her army. Hercules confronts Antinea and begins battling with her soldiers, but he falls into a pit where he is reunited with Hylas. Hercules and Hylas escape, and Hercules tells his son to flee the island while Hercules attempts to destroy the stone of Uranus.
Hylas finds Timoteo, who says Ismene and Androcles are to be sacrificed by being tied to a ship that will be sent ablaze then adrift. Hylas and Timoteo stop the soldiers and save Ismene and Androcles as the four of them flee the island on the same ship. The high priest of Uranus tells Hercules the stone can be destroyed by the rays of the sun. Hercules smashes a hole into the top of the stone''s cave and flees.

Brad''s younger brother Douglas (Don Castle), a recent graduate in aeronautical engineering thinks Doug''s flying is too dangerous, and is hired as a design engineer at McMasters. Carol Blake (Jean Parker) wants to interest Brad in her father''s design for an aircraft made of plastic. Doug pretends to be Brad because he is attracted to her but Brad meets Carol and takes her out flying. She introduces him to her blind father, Professor Blake (Thomas W. Ross), resulting in Brad becoming immersed in the professor''s new designs.
Brad''s friend, Johnny Coles (Louis Jean Heydt), loses his life test flying his own, similar design,  that breaks apart in the air, leaving behind his wife and child. Despite his friend''s death, Brad convinces the company to build Blake''s "geodetic" aircraft design, with his brother put in charge of the project.
After Brad returns from setting a new cross-country speed record, he proposes to Carol, but she is in love with Doug. Doug doesn''t know Carol''s true feelings and with the test of the professor''s aircraft imminent, he is at odds with Brad over the new aircraft''s design. Brad has to fly the aircraft for US Army officials but is worried that the heavy test equipment will make the aircraft dangerous to fly. Doug will fly with him on the test and when a 9g power dive is scheduled, Doug passes out. The test equipment breaks free, jamming the rudder. Brad forces Doug to parachute to safety, and then cuts the rudder wires, grabbing them with his bare hands. He manages to land the aircraft safely although his hands are cut badly. With the aircraft accepted, Brad gives up test flying to become a  vice-president of McMasters Aviation. Doug and Carol find happiness and marry.','["James P.

Peter then entrusts the amulet to his sister Irene, who teaches at a Chinese mission, hoping that she will complete the journey for him. In Shanghai, at the beginning of her journey, Irene is almost kidnapped by Sargoza, but is rescued by brash young American newspaper photographer Johnny McGinty. When Irene learns that only American citizens can be evacuated from war-torn Shanghai, her friend Howard Barclay suggests that she arrange a marriage of convenience with McGinty, to which he agrees. Upon their wedding, however, Fuji Yokahama, the head of the Japanese secret service, alters a gift sent to her by a Chinese friend, a Mandarin incense burner, by filling it with dynamite. Sargoza lights the burner and is blown up. Yokahama, who thought that the amulet was in the burner, leaves, satisfied that it will not be used to claim the five million dollars to buy arms for China. After he leaves, it is revealed that Barclay, who is a Chinese agent, removed the amulet from the incense burner. Because the United States has recently banned munition shipments to warring nations, Barclay decides not to go to China, and lets Johnny and Irene, who by now want to make their marriage more than just a convenience, go on to San Francisco together.','["Charles Lamont"]','["Joseph Hoffman","Richard Sale"]','["James Dunn","Ralph Morgan","Robert Barrat"]','["Drama"]','5.6','["tt0025921","tt0033572","tt0033655","tt0037388","tt0039306","tt0029012","tt0028709","tt0039262","tt0043385","tt0027439","tt0038452","tt0039912"]','["drama"]','[{"url":"/shadows_over_shanghai.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/shadows_over_shanghai_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/shadows_over_shanghai_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','shadows_over_shanghai',21207,'Q7460792','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

One morning a new customer named Rasputin the Mystic arrives at the hotel asking for a shave and Fatty, being a skilled barber, is happy to oblige. He cuts his hair and facial hair in a way which first makes him resemble Ulysses S Grant, Abraham Lincoln and finally Kaiser Wilhelm (America had entered World War I only months earlier). His attention is soon turned, as is Buster''s, to an attractive new hotel manicurist, Cutie Cuticle, and they begin to bicker and fight over her.

Fatty and Buster both rescue her, but Fatty takes all the credit and scores himself a date with Cutie.
In order to make himself look even more heroic, Fatty arranges for Buster and the hotel clerk to pretend to rob the town bank so that Fatty can show up on the scene and apprehend them in front of Cutie. However, when Buster and the clerk arrive at the bank they discover that it is already being robbed. The robbers brawl with Fatty, Buster and the clerk, and in the ensuing chaos the thieves get away, hijacking a horse and trolley and riding out of town.

('tt0071396','free','Messiah of Evil (1973)','1973','1h 30min','A young woman named Arletty (Marianna Hill) drives to the beach town of Point Dume, California, to visit her estranged father, an artist. She finds his beachfront house, abandoned. He left a diary in which he addresses her specifically. In it he complains about darkness consuming the town, and horrible nightmares he is having, and implores Arletty to never, ever look for him. His letter tells her to talk to the owner of the art gallery, who sells his paintings. The gallery owner says he has none of her father''s paintings, does not sell them, no one ever comes in looking to buy his works, and says he doesn''t know where he went. He says Point Dune is "an artist colony" and he only vaguely remembers her father (his paintings are eerie pop art portraits of groups of people in black, white, and gray, standing; the men are always dressed in black suits, white shirts, and black ties, like dead men at a funeral). It is never clear if these are townspeople, or figures from his visions, or both.
Arletty meets a visiting Portuguese-American aristocrat Thom (Michael Greer) and his two extremely provocative, groupie-like female companions, Toni (Joy Bang) and Laura (Anitra Ford). Back at his motel, Thom interviews Charlie, (Elisha Cook, Jr.) the local town eccentric. Charlie speaks at length about "the blood moon" and "the dark stranger" and how he has lived through both. He says very soon it will be the 100 year anniversary of the first appearance of the "dark stranger." He will return, the moon will turn red, and the town will be overrun with evil. Charlie warns Arletty about her father, he says he is "one of them" now. Moments later he is murdered off screen.
Thom, Toni, and Laura are kicked out of their hotel after interviewing Charlie, and stay at Arletty''s father''s house. Arletty reads through her father''s bizarre journal entries, in which he reveals his body temperature is 85 degrees, and he mentions fighting his "condition." Meanwhile, each night, creatures gather on the beach in front of bonfires, staring straight up at the moon. The locals call it "The Waiting."
Late one evening before making a trip to San Francisco, Laura goes into the local Ralphs supermarket, and is devoured by a hoard of vampires who are feasting on raw meat; the following day, Toni goes to see a movie, and is also eaten by the other theater patrons, who are the same creatures. That evening, the "blood moon" rises, and the town''s residents turn into vampires, and the titular "Messiah of Evil" returns. Through voice-over of Charlie''s taped interviews, we learn that this "Messiah" was a former minister and a Donner Party survivor from the late 19th century turned vampire/cannibal, who has come to spread his new "religion" and lead his people up the coast and inland. While Thom hides, two policemen in riot gear drive up and fire their guns into a swarm of vampires; however, one of the cops suddenly begins to bleed, causing his now-former partner to shoot him and flee. Undaunted, the undead cop shoots his former ally, and he and the other vampires go to feast on his flesh.
Thom returns to the house, where he finds Arletty half-crazed; she is cold, cannot feel pain, and thinks she may be dead or undead. She even finds a bug crawling around in her mouth and immediately vomits up various beetles, mealworms and an anole. While Thom was gone, Arletty was visited by her father, who had warned her not to follow him and begs her to leave to tell the world about Point Dune. He then attacks her, reluctantly giving in to his "vampire" urges, and after she stabs him with garden shears before burning him alive. Startled by Thom, she stabs him in the arm with the shears. The two of them flee to the beach, but the ersatz vampires follow them, even in broad daylight. They swim out to the breakers, but Thom drowns. Arletty survives and is captured by the townspeople. Instead of killing her, she is let free under the condition that she spread word of  the religious movement throughout California and the world. This causes her to be locked up in an insane asylum. Each day, all day, she sits in the sun painting, dreading the day the Messiah and his followers come to take her away.',NULL,'["Willard Huyck","Gloria Katz"]','["Michael Greer","Marianna Hill","Joy Bang"]','["Horror"]','6.5','["tt0075666","tt0084408","tt0181012","tt0067690","tt0068457","tt0071431","tt0067341","tt0069390","tt0062453","tt0069029","tt0082242","tt0079482"]','["Horror;Dead People;Movie Powder;avi"]','[{"url":"/Messiah_of_Evil.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Messiah_of_Evil_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/MessiahofEvil_avi_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','MessiahofEvil_avi',45139,'Q6821972','wp',NULL,'["Willard Huyck","Gloria Katz"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

They are both already engaged, he to heiress Lois Clarke (Astrid Allwyn), she to Kenneth Bradley (Lee Bowman). They begin to flirt and to dine together on the ship, but his notoriety and popularity on the ship make them conscious that others are watching. Eventually, they decide that they should dine separately and not associate with each other. At a stop at Madeira, they visit Michel''s grandmother Janou (Maria Ouspenskaya), who approves of Terry and wants Michel to settle down.
As the ship is ready to disembark at New York City, the two make an appointment to meet six months later on top of the Empire State Building. Michel chooses six months because that is the amount of time he needs to decide whether he can start making enough money to support a relationship with Terry.  When the rendezvous date arrives, they both head to the Empire State Building.  However, Terry is struck by a car right as she arrives, and is told that she may not be able to walk, though that will not be known for certain for six months. Not wanting to be a burden to Michel, she does not contact him, preferring to let him think the worst. Meanwhile, Terry finds a job working at an orphanage teaching the children how to sing.
Six months go by, and during Terry''s first outing since the accident, the two couples meet by accident at the theater, though Terry manages to conceal her condition. Michel then visits her at her apartment and finally learns the truth.

He awakens night after night seeing visions of a beautiful woman in a negligee dancing in the clouds. The visions disturb him. One night he gets up, goes walking and is drawn to a doll shop. In the window he sees a doll that is the exact image of the woman in his visions. He takes his girlfriend Donna Trent (Ariadna Welter) there the next day. To his surprise the doll shop owner, Frank Lamont (Neil Hamilton), not only knows his name but insists that he ordered the doll, a likeness of Bianca Milan (Linda Christian), whom Rick has never met.
Donna spots a doll that looks just like her. Frank refuses to sell it. As Rick and Donna leave, Frank takes the doll into his oddly-decorated back room - curtains, open-flame lamps, an altar, a statue of the Buddha - and stabs it with a long pin. Donna suddenly collapses in pain. Rick takes her to hospital, where a doctor (Roy Wright) tells him that she has had a "spasm of the heart" and needs complete bed rest.
Rick has another vision of Bianca. He tells Donna that he''s going to deliver the Bianca doll to Bianca "to get this thing off my back." When Rick returns to the doll shop, Frank hands over the doll, insisting that Rick had paid for it in advance. Perplexed, Rick goes to Bianca''s luxurious apartment and is entranced by her beauty. They become lovers that night. Bianca explains that his visions are a "simple process of thought projection or thought transference," which she learned as a member of the cult of Gamba, the Great Devil God. She makes Rick accompany her right then to a cult meeting so that he can be inducted. The meeting is held in the oddly-decorated room at the doll shop, for Frank is the High Executioner of the Gamba cult.
At the meeting, Bianca explains that a human sacrifice ceremony is to be held. A young woman is laid on the altar; above her a wheel studded with knives is spun. As it lowers, Gamba decides if the sacrifice lives or dies. Frank goes behind the lectern and steps on a foot pedal, making it unclear whether he or Gamba controls the wheel. The knife blade that strikes the sacrifice is rubber. She survives unhurt. A man in the cult covertly snaps a photo of the event.
Later, at the doll shop, Rick spots the Donna doll, pinned to the wall through the heart, but he can''t remove the pin without being seen. He goes to the hospital and tells Donna that she will be completely cured at midnight that night.
Donna is in fact cured at midnight and discharged. Mary (Gene Craft), a cultist and nurse at the hospital, calls Bianca to report the sudden turn of events. When Rick arrives at Bianca''s apartment, she tells him that they must attend an emergency meeting of the cult at 10:30 that night. During the meeting, Frank says that one of them is an "intruder" and will die at midnight, then adjourns until 12:30 am. At the stroke of midnight, Frank grabs the doll of the man who took the photo - an undercover reporter - and jams a pin through its head. The reporter, who is driving, screams and clutches his forehead. His car plunges down a hillside and as Frank burns the doll, the wreckage bursts into flame.
At the 12:30 meeting, Frank announces that Rick''s loyalty is now to be tested, and Donna is brought in as a sacrifice. Frank makes Rick spin the wheel, but as it drops, Rick pulls Donna to safety. A fight breaks out. The wheel falls on Frank, killing him. The room catches fire. Rick and Donna escape. Bianca picks up her doll. Everyone else apparently dies.
With fire department sirens wailing, Rick and Donna, a romantic pair again, drive away. "That''s the end to it," says Rick. Then Bianca, once again among the clouds, gets in the last word, smiling and saying, "That''s what he thinks!"','["William J.

One day she decides to go to New York City to see a fight where a young man Mickey O''Banion is one of the boxers. Emma''s sisters are appalled by this decision, unaware that Mickey is the son of a man Emma was once  involved with years ago.
Emma arrives to the city without tickets to the fight and it turns out it is sold out. However, newspaper reporter Terry Connors, who is supposed to cover the sports event, gives his spare ticket to Emma. Terry normally reports on criminal news, but failed to scoop a kidnapping of a famous lawyer named Rex Crenshaw, and was put on sports duty instead. While trying to get the kidnapping story, Terry sacrificed a quite-important appointment at the marriage license office, and his fiancé Maris was enraged enough to break up with him.
At the fight, Terry starts suspecting Mickey''s manager Gus Hammond of kidnapping the lawyer, since Crenshaw represented Hammond''s gangster rival, Flower Henderson. Two of Hammond''s henchmen, Joe and Duke, see Terry at the fight, sitting and talking next to Emma, which leads them to believe Emma is in fact a mobster called Ma Parker. Henderson sees Hammond at the fight, and tells his goons to do off with Joe and Duke. He also makes his girlfriend Zelda try to charm Mickey to win him over.
The fight is, of course, fixed, and Mickey wins. Afterwards, Emma comes to his dressing room and tries to persuade him to come training at her place in the country, for even better results. Since Joe and Duke still believe she is Ma Parker, they tell her to leave Mickey alone and get out of their hair. Emma doesn''t scare easily, and after she has left, Joe and Duke are killed by Henderson''s men, and Emma becomes a suspect of the murders, since she was the last person who was seen talking to them. Later, Emma and Terry go together to Henderson''s night club, and find that Maris is now working there as a performer. Zelda keeps trying to charm Mickey away from Hammond and also tries to make Hammond believe Mickey os selling out to Henderson by tipping him off with a phone call.
One of Henderson''s men try to make a deal for the next fight with Mickey. Terry sees this and realizes something odd is going on, sensing there is a news story to be written. Terry phones his editor to give him the story, but is instead scolded for missing the double homicide committed at the fight. Terry snatches an envelope that was to be delivered from Henderson to another person, and gives the envelope to Emma to guard for him. He also tells her he suspects Hendeson is about to make Mickey go down for something. Hammond comes to confront Mickey about his dealings with Henderson, and shoots him, sending him to the hospital.
Emma helps reconcile Terry and Maris, but Mickey is kidnapped from the hospital, and Emma and Terry concoct a plan to rescue him from his captors. Emma is to pose as Ma Parker and infiltrate the Henderson gang, claiming she knows how to find Crenshaw for them. Henderson swallows the act whole, but when she finally has him convinced, she is kidnapped by Hammond, who rushes in and shoots Henderson. Maris is also taken hostage.
Terry manages to follow Hammond and the kidnappers to their hideout. He also brings a police detective, Miller, and they storm the hideout. They catch Hammond, and find all the missing persons, including Crenshaw. When telling his editor about his new scoop, Terry gets promoted, a raise, and a two-week honeymoon holiday. Mickey accompanies Emma to the country and meets her two sisters. Emma plans to trains Mickey in their home, using her Ma Parker attitude to persuade her sisters it is the right thing to do.','["Jean Yarbrough"]','["George Bricker","Edmond Kelso"]','["Zasu Pitts","Roger Pryor","Warren Hymer"]','["Action","Comedy","Crime"]','6.1','["tt0049748","tt0047479","tt0039324","tt0040202","tt0027286","tt0040153","tt0034850","tt0043327","tt0027185","tt0038382","tt0033949","tt0035028"]','["comedy"]','[{"url":"/sos_your_aunt_emma.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/sos_your_aunt_emma_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/sos_your_aunt_emma_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','sos_your_aunt_emma',18491,'Q7548956','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

He suddenly is grabbed by a beautiful woman, who kisses him and disappears. Charles follows the crowd to Café Dhingo and meets another pretty woman named Marion Ellswirth (Donna Reed). The mutual attraction is instant, and she invites him to join her father''s celebration of the end of the war in Europe. Charles, Marion and her persistent French suitor Claude Matine (George Dolenz) arrive at the Ellswirth household, and we find that the woman who had kissed Charles is Marion''s younger sister Helen (Elizabeth Taylor).
Their father, James Ellswirth (Walter Pidgeon), had survived World War I and promptly joined the Lost Generation. Unlike most drifters, he never grew out of it, raising his two daughters to desire such a lifestyle. Helen takes after her father and uses her beauty to sustain a life of luxury even though they are flat broke. Marion goes the other way and looks for serious-minded and conventional young men such as Claude, an aspiring prosecutor, and Charles, the future novelist. 
Charles and Helen start dating and fall in love. After Helen recovers from a near-death case of pneumonia, they get married and settle in Paris. James good-naturedly joins the happy family of Charles, with Helen eventually having a daughter Vickie (Sandy Descher). Marion, having lost Charles to Helen, agrees to marry Claude. Charles struggles to make ends meet with his meager salary, unsuccessfully works on his novels and looks after Vickie. 
At about this time, the barren oil fields in Texas that James had bought years before finally begin to produce. Charles, to whom James had given the oil fields as a dowry, quits his job, and Helen and James begin to host parties instead of going to them. Sudden wealth changes Helen, who becomes more responsible, and Charles parties his wealth away after quitting his newspaper job and having all his novels rejected by publishers. They also each start to pursue other interests: Helen flirts with handsome tennis player Paul Lane (Roger Moore), and Charles competes in a local Paris-to-Monte Carlo race with professional divorcee Lorraine Quarl (Eva Gabor). 
After the race, Charles returns to Paris, only to find Helen sitting in Café Dhingo with Paul. A fight breaks out between Paul and Charles, and an angry Charles goes home first and puts the chain on the door, preventing it from being opened all the way. When Helen comes home and tries to enter she can''t. She calls out to him, but Charles is in a drunken stupor on the staircase, and the bottle drops from his hands as Helen calls. Helen has to walk all the way to her sister''s in the snow and rain. She catches pneumonia again and dies. 
Marion petitions for and gets full custody of Vickie, and Charles returns home to America. A few years later, having straightened himself out, published a book, and stopped boozing, Charles returns to Paris, hoping his reform will persuade Marion to give Vickie back to him. Charles tells Marion that he only has one drink a day now. Marion refuses, still feeling resentful towards Charles'' having fallen for Helen instead of her and for his being responsible for Helen''s death. Seeing that Charles and Vickie belong together, Claude steps in and tells Marion that she is punishing Charles for his not realizing that Marion loved him, but marrying Helen instead, and the penalty for it is taking away the only thing he had left: his own daughter. Claude asks Marion to accept him and wanting their own child out of love and not out of defeat (as a result of Charles allowing Helen to die).
Marion goes into Café Dhingo (on whose main wall is a big picture of Helen) to look for Charles (who is gazing at the painting) and tells him that Helen would not have wanted him to be alone. Outside the cafe, Claude is with Vickie. The child runs to Charles, and Charles and the child walk away together as the movie ends.','["Richard Brooks"]','["Julius J. Epstein","Philip G.

But Thelma is a mysterious woman, and Cleve can''t help wondering if she is hiding something.
When her rich Aunt Vera is found shot, Thelma calls Cleve rather than the police, and he helps her cover up evidence that may incriminate her, but he believes her story that an intruder killed the aunt. When she emerges as the prime suspect, and is arrested for murder, Marshall is in a unique position to help her due to his job.

Her past, however, has begun to catch up with her.
Tony, her husband, rematerialises. She tells him she has successfully manipulated Cleve. She does not love him but he loves her.

Unable to deal with her guilty conscience, Jordon causes a car accident that results in her accomplice''s death and her own fatal injury.

Sweeney Todd (Tod Slaughter) is a barber with a shop near the docks of London. One day, as the mercantile ship The Golden Hope readies to leave, Todd watches Johanna Oakley (Eve Lister) and Mark Ingerstreet (Bruce Seton). They are in love, but Mark is shipping out and laments he''s a poor man unable to win the approval of Johanna''s father, Governor Oakley (D. J. Williams). Nearby, Johanna''s servant Nan (Davina Craig) asks Mark''s fellow sailor Pearley (Jerry Verno) to buy her various luxury goods while he''s away. Pearley points out he hasn''t the money to buy them. Simultaneously, Todd watches all his potential customers and thinks of the money he can make.
Back at the barbershop, Todd has been sent a new apprentice: the orphan Tobias Ragg (John Singer). Next door is a meat pie shop run by Mrs. Lovatt (Stella Rho). She has a large cellar that connects to Todd''s. In addition to being a barber, Todd buys a share of Oakley''s shipping company and hopes to marry Johanna.
Using his charm, Todd lures wealthy, respectable customers from the docks into his barbershop at Fleet Street, where he sits them in a "special" barber''s chair. Before shaving a man, he always sends Tobias to Mrs. Lovatt''s for a meat pie. When Todd pulls a lever, the chair flips over and dumps the unsuspecting victim head-first into the basement. Mrs. Lovatt then disposes of the bodies for a share of the stolen money. She is, however, increasingly annoyed with Todd for robbing the bodies preemptively and taking more than his share of the money.
The Golden Hope returns to London, with Mark a newly wealthy man. Todd lures him into his barbershop. Mark foolishly talks about his love for Johanna and shows off his new riches. Todd sends Mark down the chute but Mrs. Lovatt quickly hides him in a cupboard. When Todd comes down, he is surprised to see that the body is gone. However, he isn''t worried because he already took Mark''s fortune and is sure that young man is poor once again and won''t be allowed to marry Johanna. Mrs. Lovatt secretly helps Mark escape.
Vowing to bring Todd to justice, a disguised Mark returns to the barbershop. He sends Tobias to tell Johanna where he is. Todd fails to recognize Mark and while he gets ready to shave his new customer, Pearley sneaks into Mrs. Lovatt''s cellar. Todd pulls the lever, but Mark expects the chair to flip and holds on tight. Pearley helps him down safely and they leave the same way Mark originally escaped.
Todd is angry to find another victim missing and accuses Mrs. Lovatt of letting him escape. She admits to having let Mark go before.
Todd readies himself to go on the run. He puts together his collection of stolen goods and begins stacking up hay and wooden furniture in the basement. Johanna comes to his door, worried that Mark has been captured and harmed. Todd knocks her unconscious, puts her in a closet, sets the building on fire and then leaves.
Nan informs Mark and Pearley that Johanna went to Todd''s shop. They hurry to save her.
As the barbershop burns down and a crowd gathers around, Todd watches from a nearby alleyway. When Mark go inside to save Johanna, Todd follows and attempts to slash his throat. Mark manages to knock Todd unconscious and gets out with Johanna. On the street Johanna and Mark kiss. Beside them lies Todd''s bag of riches in the alleyway.
Todd regains consciousness. As he attempts to escape, his special chair flips him into the fiery cellar.

His greedy family descends upon him like "cats around a canary", causing him to become insane. West orders that his last will and testament remain locked in a safe and go unread until the 20th anniversary of his death. As the appointed time arrives, West''s lawyer, Roger Crosby (Tully Marshall), discovers that a second will mysteriously appeared in the safe. The second will may only be opened if the terms of the first will are not fulfilled. The caretaker of the West mansion, Mammy Pleasant (Martha Mattox), blames the manifestation of the second will on the ghost of Cyrus West, a notion that the astonished Crosby quickly rejects.

As midnight approaches, West''s relatives arrive at the mansion: nephews Harry Blythe (Arthur Edmund Carewe), Charles "Charlie" Wilder, Paul Jones, his sister Susan Sillsby (Flora Finch) and her niece Cecily Young (Gertrude Astor), and niece Annabelle West. Cyrus West''s fortune is bequeathed to the most distant relative bearing the name "West": Annabelle. The will, however, stipulates that to inherit the fortune, she must be judged sane by a doctor, Ira Lazar (Lucien Littlefield). If she is deemed insane, the fortune is passed to the person named in the second will. The fortune includes the West diamonds which her uncle hid years ago. Annabelle realizes that she is now like her uncle, "in a cage surrounded by cats."
While the family prepares for dinner, a guard (George Siegmann) barges in and announces that an escaped lunatic called the Cat is either in the house or on the grounds. The guard tells Cecily, "He''s a maniac who thinks he''s a cat, and tears his victims like they were canaries!" Meanwhile, Crosby suspects someone in the family might try to harm Annabelle and decides to inform her of her successor. Before he speaks the person''s name, a hairy hand with long nails emerges from a secret passage in a bookshelf and pulls him in, terrifying Annabelle. When she explains what happened to Crosby, the family immediately concludes that she is insane.
Alone in her assigned room, Annabelle examines a note slipped to her which reveals the location of the family jewels, fashioned into an elaborate necklace. She follows the note''s instructions and soon discovers the hiding place, in a secret panel above the fireplace. She retires for the night, wearing the diamond-encrusted necklace and begins to toss and turn.
While Annabelle sleeps, the same mysterious hand emerges from the wall behind her bed and snatches the diamonds from her neck. Once again, her sanity is questioned, but as Harry and Annabelle search the room, they discover a hidden passage in the wall and in it the corpse of Roger Crosby. Mammy Pleasant leaves to call the police, while Harry searches for the guard; Susan runs away in hysterics and hitches a ride with a milkman (Joe Murphy). Paul and Annabelle return to her room to search for the missing envelope, and discover that Crosby''s body is missing. Paul vanishes as the secret passage closes behind him. Wandering in the hidden passages, Paul is attacked by the Cat and left for dead. He regains consciousness in time to rescue Annabelle. The police arrive and arrest the Cat, who is Charlie Wilder in disguise; the guard is his accomplice. Wilder is the person named in the second will; he hoped to drive Annabelle insane so that he could receive the inheritance.','["Paul Leni"]','["John Willard","Robert F.

('tt0051380','free','Attack of the 50 Foot Woman (1958)','1958','1h 5min','A television announcer reports sightings of a red fireball around the world. Facetiously, he calculates its path will take it to California. Nancy Archer (Allison Hayes), a wealthy but highly troubled woman with a history of emotional instability and immoderate drinking, is driving on a road that night in an American desert. A glowing sphere settles on the deserted highway in front of her, causing her to veer off the road. When she gets out to investigate the object, a huge creature exits and reaches for her (the viewer sees only an enormous hand falling upon the screaming woman).
Nancy escapes and runs back to town, but nobody believes her story due to her known drinking problem and a recent stay in a mental institution. Her philandering husband, Harry Archer (William Hudson), is more interested in his latest girlfriend, town floozy Honey Parker (Yvette Vickers). He pretends to be the good husband in the hope that Nancy will "snap" and return to the "booby hatch", leaving him in control of her 50-million-dollar estate.
Nancy bargains with Harry, asking him to search the desert with her for the "flying satellite", agreeing to a voluntary return to the sanatorium if they find nothing. As night falls, they find the spacecraft and the alien creature emerges, now as an enormous male humanoid. Harry fires his pistol at the giant, but the gunfire has no effect. Harry flees, leaving Nancy behind.
She is later discovered on the roof of her pool house in a delirious state and must be sedated by her family physician, Dr. Cushing (Roy Gordon). The doctor comments on scratches he finds on Nancy''s neck, and theorizes that she was exposed to radiation. Egged on by his mistress Honey, Harry plans to inject Nancy with a lethal dose of her sedative, but when he sneaks up to her room, he discovers that she has grown to giant size (in a scene paralleling Nancy''s first alien encounter, only an enormous hand is seen as Harry reacts in horror).
Cushing and Dr. Von Loeb, a specialist brought in by Cushing, are at a loss on how to treat their giant patient. They keep her in a morphine-induced coma and restrain her with chains while waiting for the authorities to arrive. The sheriff and Jess (Ken Terrell), Nancy''s faithful butler, track enormous footprints leading away from the estate to the alien sphere. Inside the sphere, they find Nancy''s diamond necklace (containing the largest diamond in the world) and other large diamonds, each in a clear orb. They speculate that the jewels are being used as a power source for the alien ship. The huge alien reappears, and the sheriff and Jess flee.
Meanwhile, Nancy awakens and breaks free of her restraints. She tears off her mansion''s roof and, clothed in a bikini-like arrangement of bed linens, heads to town to avenge herself on her unfaithful husband. Ripping the roof off the local bar, she spots Honey and drops a ceiling beam on her rival, killing her. Harry panics, grabs Deputy Charlie''s pistol, and begins shooting, but she picks up Harry and walks away, the gunshots have no apparent effect on her. The sheriff fires a shotgun at her, which causes a nearby power line transformer to blow up, killing Nancy. The doctors find Harry lying dead in her hand.','["Nathan Juran"]',NULL,'["Allison Hayes","William Hudson","Yvette Vickers"]','["Horror","Sci-Fi"]','5.1','["tt0106317","tt0050118","tt0054416","tt0052378","tt0059878","tt0050545","tt0045546","tt0060168","tt0051756","tt0048215","tt0050147","tt0048696"]','[""]','[{"url":"/attack_of_the_50_ft_woman_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/attack_of_the_50_ft_woman_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','attack_of_the_50_ft_woman',52354,'Q543347','wp','["Mark Hanna"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Carson questions Janet Bradley after finding her name in the dead man''s appointment book. She admits that the Bard had been blackmailing her friend for $20,000, and that she went to see him, though she had been able to raise only half the money. When he refused to settle for that, she claims she took what she came for at gunpoint. Max Calvert, a newspaper owner, pressures Carson to arrest Bradley to hurt her father''s election campaign for mayor. Carson declines.
When Dr. Yager, the corrupt medical examiner, informs Calvert that Bard actually died from poison, Calvert orders him to get the body out of the police station and substitute another corpse for it before anyone else finds out.
Meanwhile, Carson interviews Bard''s estranged wife, Nora, who is accompanied by her lawyer and boyfriend, Arthur Templeton.
Complications ensue when a prisoner pulls his own switch, taking the place of Bard''s body to escape from the police station in an ambulance. Johnny Williams, the new reporter on the police beat, finds the missing body in a closet. He gets a scoop for his newspaper, and Carson gets his corpse back. The lieutenant notices there is very little blood for a fatal gunshot, so he orders another autopsy, by someone other than Yager.
Then Nora Bard and Arthur Templeton voluntarily confess to him that they lied before. Nora was in her husband''s apartment when he died. She had gone to plead for a divorce, and hid in another room when Janet Bradley arrived. After Janet left, Nora found Walter dying after drinking some liquor. When she ran out, she was seen by Templeton. He went into the apartment, assumed Nora had committed the crime, and staged the fake suicide to protect her.
Noticing a fresh flower among Bard''s effects, Carson questions flower seller Flossie. She mentions that when she went to try to collect what Bard owed her, she saw Yager unlock and enter Bard''s apartment. Carson confronts Yager. Knowing that Bard had been investigating Yager for a malpractice suit, the policeman guesses that Yager stole the evidence Bard had found and poisoned the liquor. Yager makes a break for it, but is caught. At Detective Oppenheimer''s suggestion, Carson then takes Janet Bradley out.','["Otto Brower"]','["Scott Darling","Charles G.

('tt0165081','free','Airborne (1962)','1962','1h 20min','Eddie Slocom (Bobby Diamond) is a young country boy from a farm in Indiana who decides to volunteer to become a paratrooper because of his dreams to be like his uncle Charlie, a paratrooper in World War II. Upon arriving at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, he meets a motley crew of volunteers and draftees from varying socio-economic backgrounds with a montage of their basic training shown during the credits. Most notable are Rocky, the bully of the group from Chicago, and Mouse, jive-talking, self-styled "lover" of the group from the Bronx, who both play important supporting roles in the film. There are also the two sergeants of the platoon, the tough veteran platoon sergeant, Sergeant First Class Benner, and his assistant, the more affable and pleasant but still tough Sgt. White (played by the famous Hollywood stunt man Whitney Hughes).
As a wet-behind-the-ears, immature and naive farm-boy and country bumpkin, Eddie is initially mocked by his peers for his wholesome ways and trusting manner, eventually however he earns their respect by his courage, honor, friendliness and his ability to be a good teammate and comrade despite not being the most skilled paratrooper.
Drama develops when Eddie meets a doe-eyed country girl by the name of Jenny May and this provides the then necessary "love-interest" for the male lead and a diverting sub-plot to the main theme of the film. Various ups and downs in the life and training of the main protagonist follow.
As time goes by all except Rocky cease their teasing of Eddie. Rocky takes Jenny May away from Eddie at a dance on post, later ridicules Eddie''s love letters to her and physically threatens not only Eddie but the other members of the group. When Rocky is overheard ridiculing people from farms and members of the 4-H Club, SFC Benner stands in Rocky''s face and loudly reminds him that he too is a farmer and asks him if he would like to repeat his comments to his face but Rocky backs down. He instructs Slocum to recite the values of the 4-H that he advises the men to follow. To further demonstrate that being a paratrooper is more than jumping out of an aircraft, he orders the group to a guided tour of the Division''s museum where all but Rocky are impressed by the courage of the Division in two world wars, including an account of another country bumpkin Sgt. Alvin York.
The climax of the training is the platoon''s first jump. Rocky collides into Eddie and Rocky''s chute collapses. The small Eddie is able to grab Rocky''s collapsed parachute and holds it allowing Rocky to land safely. Rocky is not only shocked by Eddie''s courage and strength but the group of friends he has bullied eagerly run to him to see if he is safe. People sincerely caring about him is something that has never happened to Rocky before. All of the group become buddies and proud members of the US 82nd Airborne Division.','["James Landis"]',NULL,'["Bobby Diamond","Robert Christian","Mikel Angel"]','[""]','5.4','["tt0057465","tt0058392","tt0056524","tt0059636","tt0055974","tt0037197","tt0059093","tt0039816","tt0054744","tt0055946","tt0051994"]',NULL,'[{"url":"/airborne.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/airborne_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/airborne_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','airborne',49590,'Q4698427','wp','["James Landis"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Pete suddenly collapses due to the extreme heat and to what he blames as "my darned old heart".  Before he dies, he tells his nephew, "Work for yourself; grow your own crops." Sam heeds his uncle''s advice, so he, Nona, their children Daisy and Jot, and "Granny" (Beulah Bondi) leave the migrant camp and set out to work a vacant tenant farm with little more than two mules, a second-hand plow, and some cotton seed and fertilizer. The land that the family leases includes only a decaying shack and a well, a dry one.  In immediate need of drinking water, Sam visits a gruff neighboring farmer, Henry Devers (J. Carrol Naish), who reluctantly allows the Tuckers to share water from his well. Sam and his family nearly freeze and starve during their first winter on the farm, surviving largely on a limited diet of opossums, raccoons, and other small game that he is able to shoot. As spring arrives, Jot falls ill with "spring sickness". The town doctor informs Nona that the boy needs more diverse, vitamin-enriched foods, including vegetables, fruits, and milk to survive. The Tuckers immediately plant a garden, but its produce will take time to mature. Daily servings of milk would provide the suffering Jot with some timely relief, but the family cannot afford to buy or even rent a cow.
Sam''s friend Tim (Charles Kemper) offers to help get him a factory job that pays the attractive wage of seven dollars a day. Sam, though, remains determined to succeed as a farmer. Soon the family''s prayers are answered when Harmie, who owns the local general store, and Tim arrive in Harmie''s flatbed truck with a milk cow, which young Daisy names "Uncle Walter." The family''s cotton crop and the much-needed vegetable garden they planted finally begin to flourish. Meanwhile, the embittered Devers and his strange nephew Finlay (Norman Lloyd) plot to ruin the Tuckers so Devers can buy the tenant farm for a cheaper price from its owner.

After Finley destroys the Tuckers'' garden, Sam confronts Devers at his farm.  There Devers, armed with a knife, declares he will no longer share his well water, whereupon the two men have a near-deadly fight. Sam leaves and Devers gets a rifle and follows him.  Soon he finds Sam at the nearby river pulling in a fishing line on which he has hooked "Lead Pencil," an enormous catfish that Devers has been trying to catch for years. In return for the fish and the bragging rights that he was the one who caught it, Devers agrees to give Sam his garden and allow him continued access to his well, a deal that effectively puts an end to the trouble between the two families.
Harmie (Percy Kilbride) now marries Sam''s mother, and a party is held at his general store to celebrate the wedding.  Life at last seems to offer true promise for the Tuckers amid the joy of that occasion.  Unfortunately, a violent rainstorm rolls in as the party is ending.  The next day the family returns to their farm, where heavy winds and flooding from the storm have ruined their entire cotton crop and ravaged their home.  Sam, stunned by the sudden devastation, lets Tim accompany him as he searches for the family''s missing cow.  They find the animal alive but struggling in the swollen river. Tim nearly drowns in the deep water, but Sam rescues him. After pulling his friend from the river, Sam tells him that he is giving up farming and is now willing to take a factory job. However, upon returning again to his battered home, he reconsiders his decision about quitting once he sees the resilience of his wife and grandmother, who are busy cleaning up what remains of the house and professing their resolve to start over again. The film ends with Sam and Nona, months after the flood, standing together in a freshly plowed field preparing for a new season and a new crop.','["Jean Renoir"]','["Hugo Butler","George Sessions Perry"]','["Zachary Scott","Betty Field","J.

With United States Army Reserve test pilot Jerry Blackwood (John Carroll), Gallagher visits the Goering-Gage company. Jerry test flies Goering-Gage aircraft but finds nothing wrong. When a severely injured passenger from a crash, claims a mystery aircraft attacked them, the owner, Henry Goering (Henry Hall) hires psychiatrist, Dr. Norris (John Elliott), to question the man. Dr. Norris believes a psychotic ex-World War I flying ace, whom he dubs "Pilot X," may be behind the attacks.
With the help of Blackwood, Goering and Norris assemble a group of five ex-flying aces living in the area who may have a connection with the mysterious Pilot X. He recruits German Lieutenant Baron von Guttard (Hans Joby), French Lieutenant Rene Le Rue (Gaston Glass), British Captain Roland Saunders (Pat Somerset), Canadian Lieutenant Douglas Thompson (Wheeler Oakman) and American Lieutenant John Ives (Reed Howes).  The group meets in a mansion to plan how to confront the mysterious Pilot X.
One pilot, however, von Guttard comes under immediate suspicion when Goering is uneasy with son Carl (Leon Ames), an ex-German prisoner of war. On their first patrol, Pilot X attacks, killing von Guttard . Later that day, Le Rue is killed by Pilot X and the next day, Saunders has a mental breakdown. Blackwood receives a note from Pilot X, asking him to meet him in the sky at six o''clock the next morning.

Esperanza is thirty-five years old, pregnant with her third child and emotionally dominated by her husband, Ramon Quintero (Juan Chacón).
The majority of the miners are Mexican-Americans and want decent working conditions equal to those of white, or "Anglo" miners. The unionized workers go on strike, but the company refuses to negotiate and the impasse continues for months. Esperanza gives birth and, simultaneously, Ramon is beaten by police and jailed on bogus assault charges following an altercation with a union worker who betrayed his fellows. When Ramon is released, Esperanza tells him that he''s no good to her in jail. He counters that if the strike succeeds they will not only get better conditions right now but also win hope for their children''s futures.
The company presents a Taft-Hartley Act injunction to the union, meaning any miners who picket will be arrested. Taking advantage of a loophole, the wives picket in their husbands'' places. Some men dislike this, seeing it as improper and dangerous. Esperanza is forbidden to picket by Ramon at first, but she eventually joins the line while carrying her baby.
The sheriff, by company orders, arrests the leading women of the strike. Esperanza is among those taken to jail. When she returns home, Ramon tells her the strike is hopeless, as the company will easily outlast the miners. She insists that the union is stronger than ever and asks Ramon why he can''t accept her as an equal in their marriage. Both angry, they sleep separately that night.
The next day the company evicts the Quintero family from their house. The union men and women arrive to protest the eviction. Ramon tells Esperanza that they can all fight together. The mass of workers and their families proves successful in saving the Quinteros'' home. The company admits defeat and plans to negotiate.

('tt0039645','free','My Favorite Brunette (1947)','1947','1h 27min','The story is told in flashback from Death Row as Ronnie Jackson (Bob Hope) relates to a group of reporters the events that lead to his murder conviction.  Jackson is a San Francisco baby photographer who dreams about being a real private detective like his office neighbor Sam McCloud (Alan Ladd). One day he is mistaken for a detective by  mysterious lady in distress Carlotta Montay (Dorothy Lamour), who claims that her wheelchair-bound husband was kidnapped at the pier as they arrived from overseas. A sinister figure (Lorre) listens at the office door. Carlotta gives Ronnie her address, and a coded map. Ronnie hides the map in the cups next to his office water cooler. Ronnie then drives to the address, which is a mansion down the Peninsula. Kismet (Peter Lorre) greets him at the door, lifting his handgun. Carlotta tells Ronnie that the missing man is her uncle, not her husband. He entered the country on some secret mission, she says. The mansion belongs to Major Montague, she says, who was a former partner of her uncle. Major Montague enters the room, and calls Carlotta away for a phone call. Major Montague also believes that Ronnie is a private detective, as he had Kismet follow him from the office. When Carlotta is out of the room, Montague tells Ronnie that Carlotta is mentally ill. He introduces Ronnie to a wheelchair-bound man in the next room as Carlotta''s uncle, who tells Ronnie that he obviously has not been kidnapped. Ronnie tells Montague that Carlotta had given him a map to hold. Carlotta reenters the room, and when alone with Ronnie, tells him that the call was from her uncle, who told her he was safe. "He was forced to make that call", opines Carlotta. Now she suspects Montague, because he lied to Ronnie about her. She tells him to guard the map with his life.
As Ronnie leaves the mansion, he finds that his handgun is missing. Ronnie climbs up a tree and looks into a window, and sees the "Uncle" stand up out of the wheelchair and walk around the room. As Ronnie snaps a photo of this fake uncle through the keyhole, Kismet, who has followed him, throws a knife at him. Ronnie flees to his car and roars out of the mansion grounds. The others chase him by car and shoot out his tire. Ronnie runs into an apartment and intercoms himself in by saying that he is "Joe", and many women buzz him in.
Back at his office, Ronnie develops the keyhole  photo showing the "Uncle" walking about. Kismet has followed him there, and as Ronnie is calling the police, slugs him over the head, and burns the photo and what he thinks is the negative. When Ronnie comes to, a lady customer arrives to pick up her baby''s photograph, and Ronnie gives her what he thinks is her baby''s negative.
Ronnie summons the police and drives back to the mansion with them. The mansion is deserted, and Kismet poses as the gardener for the owners, who are out of the country. The police apologize to Kismet for the interruption. (This scene would be repeated years later by Alfred Hitchcock in his film "North By Northwest" with Cary Grant.) Montague gives Kismet Carlotta''s ring with a note attached to leave as a ''clue'' for Ronnie to discover. Ronnie returns to the mansion and finds the clue, which is a card for the Seacliffe Lodge in Carmel. Ronnie drives to the Lodge, which is really a sanitarium. After a bizarre golf match with an inmate and an imaginary golf ball, Ronnie is captured by the Montague gang and locked in a room at the sanitarium. Carlotta is also prisoner there. Montague explains that Carlotta''s uncle had turned down his offer to buy mineral rights in some land. Carlotta''s real uncle is then wheeled into the room to prove he is unhurt. He asks Carlotta to light his cigarette, then puts it out and gives her the cigarette. Ronnie refuses to reveal the whereabouts of the coded map, so Kismet slugs him. Carlotta tells them falsely that the map is in a water cooler cup at the Ferry Building, about an hour away. Montague sends a stooge to the Ferry Building to get the map. In her room Carlotta unwraps the cigarette from her uncle and the note on the paper says to see a ''James Collins'', a scientist. Ronnie and Carlotta are able to knock out a nurse and flee from the sanitarium. Back at his office Ronnie gives Carlotta the map. They call James Collins'' office and arrange to meet him at a restaurant that night. A stooge for the bad guys has followed them and overhears their arrangements.
They meet the scientist, James Collins, at the restaurant and show him the map. Collins says that he made the coded map, which depicts cryolite deposits from which uranium can be mined. He says that Carlotta''s uncle had scheduled an important meeting with the government at the Pilgrim Hotel in Washington. Collins takes the map and Ronnie drives him to the police station. As Ronnie drives up to the police station, Kismet, who is hiding in the back seat with Ronnie''s gun, shoots Collins and takes the map out of his pocket. Ronnie and the dead Collins are spotted by the police, and Ronnie flees the scene. He is now wanted for the Collins murder.
Carlotta and a disguised Ronnie fly to Washington and go to the Pilgrim Hotel. They answer a help wanted ad and sign up as a bellboy and a maid at the hotel. In the gang''s suite, they record the gang''s confessions on a recording machine, including Kismet''s confession that he murdered Collins. But when the police are called, Kismet switches the records and throws the incriminating record out the window. Montague points out to the police that Ronnie is wanted for the Collins murder in San Francisco. Ronnie is arrested and taken away; the gang still has the map and Carlotta''s real uncle.
The flashback ends. Ronnie is on death row, and curses Carlotta for disappearing and not testifying at his trial for Collins'' murder.  When the prison warden comes to get Ronnie from his death row cell, Ronnie faints. When he comes to, Carlotta is there, and tells him that he is a free man. Ronnie had mistakenly given the keyhole photo negative to his customer. The photo from that negative revealed the uncle to be an impostor. Carlotta said that detective Sam took that lead, capturing the gang and ''the rest was routine''. Ronnie was cleared. Carlotta''s uncle was saved.
The warden tells the executioner that the execution was cancelled. The executioner (Bing Crosby) curses  and walks away.

('tt0025748','free','The Scarlet Pimpernel (1934)','1934','1h 37min','In 1792, at the bloody height of the French Revolution''s Reign of Terror, vengeful French mobs are outraged when again and again French aristocrats are saved from death by the audacious "Band of the Scarlet Pimpernel", a secret society of 20 English noblemen, "one to command, and nineteen to obey". Among the latest scheduled for execution are the Count de Tournay, former ambassador to Great Britain, and his family. However, one of the Scarlet Pimpernel''s men visits them in prison disguised as a priest and gives them a message of hope. As the prisoners are being escorted to the cart to be taken to the guillotine, the guards take the count away; French leader Maximilien Robespierre wishes to question him further. The countess and her daughter are rescued and spirited away to England.
Back in Paris, Robespierre meets with Chauvelin, the republic''s new ambassador to Britain, to discuss the problem of the Scarlet Pimpernel. Summoning the Count de Tournay, they offer him his life in return for information from his English contacts as to the Pimpernel''s true identity. The Scarlet Pimpernel is Sir Percy Blakeney, a wealthy English baronet and friend of the Prince of Wales. Sir Percy cultivates the image of a fop in order to throw off suspicion. His pose is so successful that not even his French wife Marguerite suspects the truth. Though the two are in love, Sir Percy no longer trusts his wife because of her past denunciation of the Marquis de St. Cyr, which led to the execution of the marquis and his family.
Through his network of spies, Chauvelin discovers that Armand St. Just, Marguerite''s brother is one of the Scarlet Pimpernel''s agents. Chauvelin orders Armand''s arrest, then uses the threat of his execution to force Marguerite into helping him discover the identity of the Pimpernel, who he knows will be at an upcoming ball. At the ball, Marguerite intercepts a message given to Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, a member of the Pimpernel''s band, stating that the Pimpernel will be in the library at midnight. She passes the information along to Chauvelin, who goes to the library to find only Percy, apparently asleep. While waiting, Chauvelin falls asleep; when he wakes up, he finds a message from the Pimpernel mocking him.
The next morning, Percy and Marguerite travel to their house in the country. There, Marguerite breaks down and tells her husband of Armand''s arrest and her deal with Chauvelin. Confronting her, Percy learns the truth behind the denunciation of the marquis; he had her imprisoned for consorting with his son. After the revolution freed her, she told her friend Chauvelin, who was the one who denounced them. Promising to use his influence at court on Armand''s behalf, Percy leaves for London. Afterward, Marguerite notices a detail on a portrait of the 1st baronet hanging in the library – on his finger is a ring decorated by a pimpernel. Realizing that she has inadvertently betrayed her own husband, she rushes out of the room, only to be presented a letter from Chauvelin announcing that he had discovered the Pimpernel''s true identity as well. Racing back to London, she warns Ffoulkes that Percy''s life is in danger.  Ffoulkes agrees to mobilise the band to warn Percy.
To lure Percy into his trap, Chauvelin has both Armand and the Count de Tournay transferred to Boulogne-sur-Mer. Despite the vigilance of Chauvelin''s men, the Pimpernel frees the two men from prison through bribery. However, one of the prison guards tells Chauvelin that the Pimpernel will be at a certain tavern (the Lion d''Or) that evening. Marguerite goes there to warn Percy, only to be arrested by Chauvelin and his troops. Percy arrives at the appointed time and is met by a gloating Chauvelin. Percy distracts him long enough for Armand and the count to board the ship, but as he prepares to leave, Chauvelin announces that he has Marguerite in custody.

Intertitles boast of McCay as "the originator and inventor of Animated Cartoons", and of the 25,000 drawings needed to complete the film.  McCay is shown working with a group of anonymous assistants on "the first record of the sinking of the Lusitania".The liner passes the Statue of Liberty and leaves New York Harbor. After some time, a German submarine cuts through the waters and fires a torpedo at the Lusitania, which billows smoke that builds until it envelops the screen. Passengers scramble to lower lifeboats, some of which capsize in the confusion. The liner tilts from one side to the other and passengers are tossed into the ocean.A second blast rocks the Lusitania, which sinks slowly into the deep as more passengers fall off its edges, and the ship submerges amid scenes of drowning bodies. The liner vanishes from sight, and the film closes with a mother struggling to keep her baby above the waves. An intertitle declares: "The man who fired the shot was decorated for it by the Kaiser!

Ronald decides to follow Mary, who rejected him because she loves athletes more than bookworms, to Clayton which the dean describes as an "athlete-infested college".  Hoping to impress Mary, Ronald tries out for the baseball and track and field teams, but proves to be totally inept.  At the same time, he attempts to work as a soda jerk and as a waiter in blackface while trying to keep these jobs a secret from Mary.
Eventually the dean asks Ronald why his grades are suffering.  After Ronald explains the situation, the dean empathizes with him and orders the rowing coach to make Ronald the coxswain in the upcoming competition.  The coach tries to sabotage Ronald by slipping him a sleeping potion so he cannot compete, but the potion is accidentally consumed by the team''s other coxswain instead.  Despite Ronald capsizing the boat, pulling the rudder off mid-race, and causing collisions with other boats, the Clayton team wins the race anyway.
Meanwhile, Mary starts to appreciate Ronald’s futile efforts to impress her.  However, on the day of a competition, Jeff, Mary’s athlete boyfriend, gets kicked out of college and takes her hostage in her room in an effort to get her kicked out also to get her to marry him. In the end, she manages to contact Ronald by telephone, who in a sudden show of athleticism sprints to her dormitory, pole vaults into her window, and fights off Jeff by throwing household objects at him.

('tt0050987','free','Snezhnaya koroleva (1957)','1957','1h 8min','Hans Christian Andersen''s story is simplified in this animated version of his fairy tale. A little man, who introduces himself as "Old Dreamy" ("Ole Lukøje"), he tells the viewer that on days when the master storyteller Andersen is not overtired, he puts him to sleep with his colorful, magic umbrella ("slumbrella") causing him to dream wonderful stories—from which he then writes his fairy tales. Old Dreamy narrates the story of the Snow Queen.
Two young children, Kay and Gerda are in their window box garden where they exchange roses they have grown for one another and plant them together. On the next winter night, Gerda''s grandmother tells the two children the legend of the Snow Queen. The Snow Queen''s palace of ice in the far north (on Spitsbergen) where she sits on her throne and looks into her mirror. The Snow Queen''s proud and frowning face is seen by Gerda through a frosted window who exclaims, "It''s the Snow Queen!". Kay jokes, "Let her come in here, and I''ll put her on a hot stove!". The Snow Queen, who is watching the children in her mirror, becomes angry and smashes the mirror with her scepter. She enchants the ice splinters to pierce the eyes and hearts of those who have offended her. Back at Gerda''s home, the window bursts open and ice splinters enter Kay''s eyes and heart. He becomes hostile toward Gerda, and when Gerda becomes upset that the cold wind and snow have blackened their roses, Kay stomps on them and kicks them about in glee. He then leaves Gerda in tears to be comforted by her grandmother.
The next day, Kay goes for a sled ride in the marketplace of the city.  Gerda wants to come along as she has before, but Kay says she will fall and cry. He lets her on the sled, but pulls it harshly, knocking Gerda off and then taunts her for crying before running off. Kay ties his sled to the sleigh of the Snow Queen, which has suddenly appeared in the village square, to Gerda''s horror. The Snow Queen pulls Kay on his sled out of the city, where she stops and confronts him, taking him into her arms as her willing captive, since his heart is as cold as ice. The Snow Queen''s presence freezes a mother bird to death as she protects her young under her.
Old Dreamy''s story continues with Gerda looking for Kay when spring comes. She asks young birds and animals if they had seen Kay, to no avail. At the river bank, Gerda begs the river to take her in a row boat to Kay. She gives her new red shoes to the river, and her boat is guided down the stream to the home of an old sorceress. She comes out of her garden to the trumpeting and drumming of four toy soldiers, who stand at her gate as sentinels. The old woman uses her crook to pull Gerda''s boat to shore. She takes Gerda into her garden of eternal summer with sparkling flowers. In her house, the old woman puts Gerda to sleep by combing her hair. She wants Gerda to stay with her and forget Kay, but Gerda awakes when the old woman falls asleep. The sorceress charmed Gerda to forget her previous life, but Gerda remembers Kay when she sees two roses growing together. When she gets to the gate she finds that outside the garden it is already fall.
Gerda is next found by the seashore where she is met by a raven, "Mr. Corax" (Latin for "raven"). Gerda tells him that she is looking for a "good, kind, brave boy". Mr. Corax tells her that such a boy is now living at the palace of a princess. Mr. Corax takes Gerda to the palace to find his fiancée Henrietta, who knows the palace and can guide Gerda through it. They arrive at the palace in the midst of a ball with fireworks. When all are asleep, the ravens take Gerda into the palace and to the royal bedroom. Gerda takes a lantern and tries to wake the boy, but he is not Kay and, startled, she drops the lantern. The shock awakens him and princess, who calls her guards. When the princess hears Gerda''s tale of seeking her friend, she and the prince decide to help.
An interlude follows with the Snow Queen and Kay talking in her ice palace throne room. Kay is playing with ice crystals, but he misses the smell of flowers. The Snow Queen tells him that the smell of flowers, beauty, joy, poetry, and love do not exist and to forget them. Kay does not remember joy or beauty, but when asked if he remembers love, he recalls Gerda, irritating the Snow Queen. The princess and her prince send Gerda on her way with a golden coach and attendants. While the coach travels through a dark woods, they are stopped by a gang of robbers, who take Gerda and strip the coach of its gold plate, sparing the attendants. An old woman takes Gerda, but when she is bitten on the ear by her daughter Angel, who is riding on her back. She listens to her request to keep Gerda with her other captive pets. These pets include a fox, little rabbits, the birds that were spared the Snow Queen''s frost when she first took Kay, and a large reindeer named Bae. The birds tell Gerda that they saw the Snow Queen take Kay with her to Lapland. The reindeer offers to take Gerda there. It remains for the robber girl to let Gerda and Bae go, which she does. She also releases the birds, the fox, and the rabbits, but starts crying, since she only wanted to have friends, so the animals decide to stay with her.
Gerda and Bae get to the Lapp woman, who warms them by their fire. She tells them that the Snow Queen had stopped there with Kay but went on farther north to Finland. She directs them to her cousin in Finland who can direct them further, and she writes a letter to her on a fish that she sends with Gerda and Bae. When Gerda and Bae get to the Finn woman''s home, she tells them that they are just 10 miles away from the Snow Queen''s palace. Gerda and Bae leave so quickly that Gerda leaves behind her mittens and cap.
Bae, who collapses along the way, is unable to take Gerda up to the ice palace, so Gerda goes on alone. When Gerda finally gets to the palace through the blustery wind and snow, she encounters Kay, who is released from the splinters of ice in his eye and his heart by Gerda''s warm embrace. Even though the Snow Queen suddenly returns, she and her palace melt away with the coming of spring.
Gerda and Kay are taken first by Bae to the Finn woman, who takes them further on their journey home in her dog sled.

The Germans board the ship, identify one man as a Belgian spy, and take him prisoner. One of the passengers questioned is an attractive Swiss dress shop owner named Madeleine Goddard (Vivien Leigh) who is returning to Stockholm from a business trip to Paris, where she purchased dresses for her boutique. After returning to Stockholm, Madeleine, who is a German spy, meets with her contacts and provides information on Allied troop movements she acquired in Paris. The information is cleverly concealed in the gowns she purchased. While the Germans believe that she is one of their top spies, Madeleine is in fact a French double agent working to uncover the identity of the new German secret service leader in Stockholm.
Soon after, a German war veteran named Baron Karl Von Marwitz (Conrad Veidt) enters Sweden. He claims to have left the German Navy because of war injuries, but some of his former colleagues believe he is a deserter. One night, Madeleine goes to a nightclub accompanied by her friend, English secret service agent Bob Carter (Anthony Bushell). She notices Von Marwitz playing a bar room game predicting what girls will say after he kisses them. After she exposes the trick, Von Marwitz becomes intrigued by Madeleine''s beauty and cool demeanor. The next day he visits her shop with Lupita (Joan Gardner), the Brazilian socialite he tricked the previous evening. After the temperamental Lupita leaves, Von Marwitz begins asking Madeleine to go out with him. In the coming days, she continues to refuse his requests, even after he offers to purchase all the stock in her shop. When he finally gives up, she gives in and agrees to date him.
Madeleine and Von Marwitz begin seeing each other socially, and despite their differences, they fall deeply in love. Von Marwitz even proposes marriage. Their whirlwind romance is interrupted one night when Madeleine''s German co-conspirator, Anatole Bergen, is murdered. Madeleine meets with her German contacts who inform her that the recent information she provided proved disastrous for the German Army. She is ordered to return to Paris immediately and investigate her French contacts. When Madeleine reaches Paris, she is met by a high-ranking French official who presents her with the Médaille militaire for her brave service to her country. Despite her reluctance to continue her work in Stockholm, she is ordered to return.
Back in Stockholm, Madeleine and Von Marwitz are reunited and she reveals that she knows he is the German secret service leader. In response, he reveals that he knows that she is in fact a French spy. Although relieved that they can finally speak honestly with each other, they acknowledge that their dream of a life together can never happen. Soon after, Madeleine turns to her friend Bob for protection, now that her true identity is known to the Germans. While Bob plans her escape from Stockholm and the Germans, Von Marwitz plans her capture and return to Germany. The next day, Bob arranges for Madeleine to be arrested by the Stockholm police, ruining Von Marwitz''s plan to capture her quietly.
After Madeleine is deported, her ship is stopped by a German U-boat in neutral waters. Von Marwitz boards the ship and arrests Madeleine for being a French spy. As they are being rowed from the ship to the U-boat, a British Q-ship (a heavily armed merchant ship with concealed weaponry) approaches and engages the U-boat in battle, sinking the enemy vessel. Madeleine is taken aboard the Q-ship while von Marwitz is moved to a British destroyer. Her feelings of love unabated, Madeleine is assured that von Marwitz will not be shot, but instead will be detained until the end of the war. As von Marwitz is rowed away, Madeleine waves and calls out to him, "I''ll be waiting."','["Victor Saville"]','["Lajos Biró","Arthur Wimperis"]','["Conrad Veidt","Vivien Leigh","Joan Gardner"]','["Adventure","Romance","Thriller","War"]','6.3','["tt0030746","tt0029611","tt0028872","tt0030989","tt0032179","tt0038390","tt0040098","tt0026402","tt0047978","tt0035763","tt0034405","tt0029660"]','["Adventure; Romance; Thriller; Vivien Leigh"]','[{"url":"/DarkJourney.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/DarkJourney_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/DarkJourney_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','DarkJourney',11533,'Q3224886','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

A replacement spaceship, the Arcturus, will be sent from Earth, but will not arrive for two months.
The cosmonauts aboard Sirius and Vega decide that some sort of landing and exploration is better than waiting. Ivan and Allan go down from Vega in the glider, leaving Masha in orbit. All contact is lost after they land in a swamp. The Sirius lands nearby and the three-man crew set out in their hovercar to find them.
During their travels they hear an eerie woman''s song in the distance and encounter prehistoric beasts both benign and threatening. Ivan and Allan, meanwhile, must fight off some man-sized T. rex-like beasts as they head to meet the men of Sirius. The two fall ill with a fever. Their robot, John, stands watch.
The Sirius crew must submerge their hovercar to escape a pterosaur. In doing so, they discover what might have been an ancient city. Alyosha finds a strange triangular rock and a statue of a pterosaur with rubies for eyes.
Once on dry land, the Sirius crew contact the robot John and tell him to administer an anti-fever drug. Ivan and Allan recover just as a volcano sends down rivers of lava.

Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, "Hobe" Carrington (Alan Curtis) tries to turn down Countess Maria de Fresca''s (Micheline Cheirel) request to hire him as a pilot for a flight to Death Valley.  She changes his mind by promising him a dinner date. Before they can depart, Carrington is approached by his former superior in the armed forces, Bob Donovan (Jack Holt), now an FBI agent. Donovan tells Carrington to keep an eye out for the missing map.  
The Countess and her party, including wealthy Catherine Forrest (Evelyn Ankers), Catherine''s friend, James Van Bush (Roland Varno), Catherine''s brother, Claude Forrest (John Craven), and mining engineer Gerald Porter (Jerome Cowan) are told they might need oxygen masks mid-flight in overflying a storm.  Catherine and the Countess switch seats, but his oxygen mask has been disconnected, forcing Carrington to dive to save Catherine''s life. The Countess later tells Carrington she fears someone may have actually been meaning to kill her.
Agent Donovan beats the flight to Death Valley and explains to Carrington that his passengers may be international racketeers who likely have the map. The group meets up with Tom Walker (Gordon Richards), another mining engineer. While separately trying to buy the map from Claude Forrest, Walker tries to bribe the Countess for a secret letter about Claude. By coincidence, Carrington''s ex-wife, Irene Allison (Inez Cooper), also in Death Valley, knows the Countess is really Dolly Lorraine, an aspiring actress, who Irene worked with in a magic show. Later, Carrington rescues Catherine from Van Bush by throwing the annoying masher into the swimming pool. Carrington then discovers that Catherine has an unusual gold ring from Japan given to her by Claude. During the course of the evening, the secret letter is stolen five times, the fifth time stolen from Tom Walker, who is murdered. 
The group is briefly questioned about the murder, and (having failed to sell the map), they have Carrington fly them to Las Vegas. As Irene lives in Las Vegas and wishes to return home, she asks to join them. In Vegas, Claude tries to sell the map to another engineer, Joseph Herman Ruehl (Michael Visaroff). Donovan tells Carrington that the secret letter revealed Claude committed treason, working with the Japanese to find uranium, and the two realize the map is actually Catherine''s ring. Irene, a licensed pilot, borrows Carrington''s aircraft, which has been sabotaged, and dies in a crash.  
Porter has been waiting for an opportunity to steal the map and, after a struggle, kills Claude at Ruehl''s horse ranch. The Countess and Ruehl are detained by Donovan before they can leave town.

As he rides into town, he takes a bullet meant for gambler Matt Daggett and across the street lies his uncle, victim of the gambler''s gun. Dagget looks on Bill as ''good luck'' and nurses him back to health and gives him the job of training "Blue Chip", the fastest quarter horse in the west, for a big race. Bill doesn''t know that Dagget plans to fix the race and put his own money on another horse at heavy odds. Quartered at the nearby ranch of John Grant, Bill meets Jerri Marshall, daughter of Bob Marshall, who lost "Blue Chip" to Daggett in a crooked gambling deal. Grant gets mixed up in a stage coach robbery and killing and rides back to the ranch with Daggett henchman Red Roper. When Roper tries to molest a woman, Bill bluffs him with an empty gun and forces him back to town. Roper is arrested for the killing and implicates Grant. Incited by Daggett, who fears exposure as the outlaw leader, a paid mob breaks into the jail and both Grant and Roper are hanged, but Grant, barely able to touch a plank with the toe of his boot, clings to life until Bill finds him and cuts him down. On the day of the race, Daggett lures Bill away from "Blue Chip" long enough for a wire to be twisted around the horse''s leg at the fetlock. "Blue Chip" goes lane partly through the race but races on in agony and wins. Daggett tries to hide his treachery by blaming the lameness on a broken leg and draws his gun to shoot the horse. Marshall intervenes and is shot by the gambler. Bill discovers the wire and now also knows that Daggett is the outlaw leader responsible for his father''s death and the hanging of his friend Grant. Bill heads for the saloon to confront Daggett. Just as the gambler turns to fire on Bill, Grant appears. When the smoke clears both Daggett and Grant are dead.','["William Beaudine"]','["Gordon Ray Young","Adele Buffington"]','["Leif Erickson","Donald Woods","Rand Brooks"]','["Western"]','5.8','["tt0043013","tt0036038","tt0042552","tt0044208","tt0044186","tt0046202","tt0038300","tt0039213","tt0050879","tt0022273","tt0023335","tt0047488"]',NULL,'[{"url":"/born_to_the_saddle.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/born_to_the_saddle_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/born_to_the_saddle_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','born_to_the_saddle',72283,'Q4946025','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The wedding ceremony has to be pushed forward, and is combined with a christening ceremony that is to be performed by the same pastor. Sonny''s ship eventually docks and when he meets his father, small-time swindler Hector, before the wedding, he is given a corsage to pass on to Janie. Hector has actually stolen the corsage from Sonny''s stepmother, opera singer Genya Smetana. Hector isn''t aware of that the corsage has real diamonds in it, and it is a gift from the opera where Genya works. Unfortunately the wedding is yet again delayed when it is discovered that Peter Carrington III, Janie''s previous suitor, has managed to lose all of Mrs. Prescott''s money on bad investments and a roulette table at the 59 Club. The family is now broke. Sonny then tells Janie he doesn''t care about her money and the wedding proceeds as planned, after Sonny agrees to let his father help Mrs. Prescott get her money back.
With the help of some friends Hector manages to fix the roulette tables at the 59 Club, and after the wedding he drags Sonny to the club before he goes off on his honeymoon.  Sonny wins repeatedly, and Peter who watches, decides to make another attempt at sabotaging the relation between Janie and Sonny. He takes Janie, Mrs. Prescott and a Senator Simpson to 59 Club. Confusion and suspicion arises as Hector is seen with his friend, night club singer Leslie, in a compromising position, and then Janie sees Sonny in a similar way. Genya is oblivious about her step-son Sonny, whom she does not know even exists, and Janie who he is about to marry, so she thinks Hector has married Janie and given her the stolen corsage.
Janie is then called to service as an air raid warden before she has time to go away on her honeymoon, while Sonny spends the night alone. To venge all the trouble that has arisen, Hector sets up to trick Peter into a bad business deal, buying worthless stock to a high price. Sonny owns such stock and when Peter is scammed, Sonny makes a fine profit. It turns out though that the banker in charge of the transaction bought the stock himself to make a good deal, and that Peter and Mrs. Prescott staged the loss of their property to test Sonny''s intentions with Janie. Genya learns that Hector has a son from another relation, who is married to Janie. Sonny and Janie finally reunite at his father''s apartment, and they spend the rest if their two-day honeymoon at her apartment. When a new order is given that Sonny has to travel immediately with his ship, the maid covers for the couple and lies, saying they already left town. Thus they get to be undisturbed for the weekend, and everyone else meet at Hector''s apartment, singing Wagner opera songs together.',NULL,'["Frederick J. Jackson","Edmund L.

On the way to Reno, Nevada, for their honeymoon, the couple stop at a bank, which is robbed by three men. 
Humphrey''s employer, Oscar Flack (George Watts) of the Flack Missing Persons Bureau, tracks the newlyweds to a Reno hotel. (Across from the hotel, Louise spots an odd advertising clock, which has no hands. This has no bearing on anything, however.) Oscar wants him to find a missing man, Hal Benedict. Louise convinces him to take the case after Oscar promises her a fur coat for locating Hal. They go to see Warren Benedict, Hal''s father. When Humphrey learns the FBI may be involved, he wants nothing to do with the case, but Oscar gets him to change his mind. Humphrey tries to keep Louise out of danger, but she has other ideas and keeps tagging along.
In the hotel bar, Humphrey learns that Hal was often seen with a woman, a redhead named Irene Donovan. A blonde named "Gypsy" Toland offers him a ride to Irene''s place, but when Humphrey is spotted by a furious Louise, he gets out of the car. Humphrey later finds Irene dead. He also finds a very much alive Rose Madden, Hal''s fiancée, who protests that she did not kill Irene. They drive off in Rose''s car, then park and start talking. Louise spots him with the brunette Rose. Louise is ready to walk out on Humphrey, but the police will not let her leave because her husband is now a murder suspect. 
Humphrey goes to see Clyde Copley, a collections investigator who admits he was hired by Hal to retrieve letters Hal wrote to Irene; Irene had threatened to use them if he married Rose Madden. Humphrey is cleared of the murder when Police Chief Bates learns that he has a solid alibi.
Warren Benedict asks to see to Humphrey, but three men fire at Humphrey and Louise as they drive to Benedict''s ranch. In a shootout, Humphrey wounds two of the men and drives them off. Then Humphrey figures out why the silver dollar found in Irene''s hand seemed familiar: it is the trademark of Red Harris, a bank robber. Afterward, Benedict shows Humphrey a ransom note demanding $50,000 for Hal''s return and specifying that Benedict''s foreman Harry Belding drop off the money that night. Humphrey tells Benedict to do as ordered.
Humphrey is accosted by two FBI agents. They are looking for a bank robber, and the sketch looks very much like Humphrey, but Oscar vouches for him. Later, Belding is murdered and robbed while on his way to deliver the ransom money.
Eventually, Gypsy lures Humphrey into an abduction; it turns out that Red Harris wants revenge on Stafford, Humphrey''s crooked lookalike. Red has to be convinced that Humphrey is not the one he wants. Humphrey determines that Red does not know any of the murder suspects, at least under their real names, so Humphrey suggests that Red stand outside a window to try to identify the person who knows him well enough to know his trademark. Red does not trust him, but Louise, who was caught snooping outside, offers to be Red''s hostage. 
Humphrey gathers everybody in Copley''s office. Red does not spot anyone he knows, and is killed in a shootout with the FBI agents, tipped off by an anonymous phone call. Humphrey finally realizes the killer must be Copley.','["Frank McDonald"]','["Daniel Mainwaring","Maxwell Shane"]','["Chester Morris","Jean Parker","Rose Hobart"]','["Comedy","Crime","Drama","Mystery"]','6.2','["tt0040604","tt0038640","tt0042707","tt0047688","tt0041631","tt0049629","tt0033890","tt0059096","tt0121515","tt0038346","tt0041187","tt0039306"]','["Chester Morris;Jean Parker;Pine-Thomas Productions;Pine-Thomas"]','[{"url":"/No_Hands_on_the_Clock.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/No_Hands_on_the_Clock_1941_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','No_Hands_on_the_Clock_1941',12045,'Q7044271','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

This was re-written during production but some elements remain, such as the otherwise nonsensical final chapter name "Operator No. 17" and Ula Vale''s unexplained periodic use of disguises in the first few chapters (Ula Vale was originally written as a government agent using "Operator No. 17" as her codename; and this plot element was dropped from the revised script, but only after some scenes from the earlier shooting script had been filmed, along with the main title cards).Several plot elements bring the characters together in search (and pursuit) of the Guatemalan idol known as The Green Goddess: Tarzan''s friend D''Arnot has crash landed in the region and is in the hands of a lost tribe of jungle natives; Major Martling is leading an expedition to find the fabled artefact for a powerful explosives formula hidden within it; Ula Vale''s fiancé died in an earlier expedition to rescue the artefact for its archaeological benefit and so she starts one of her own in his honour; and Raglan has been sent by Hiram Powers, Ula''s lawyer, to steal the valuable idol for himself.  In addition to containing the explosives formula, the idol also holds a fortune in jewels.
Tarzan, Ula and Major Martling locate the lost city containing the idol and rescue D''Arnot from the natives that worship it in the 70-minute-long first episode. However, Raglan escapes with the Green Goddess and heads through the jungle for the coast. Tarzan and the others pursue him across the jungle, encountering many perils, including recapture by the natives to whom the idol belonged. The adventures end out at sea where, during a hurricane, they are able to permanently secure the idol while Raglan is killed by another of Powers'' agents because of his failures.  The murderer perishes when the ship sinks.

The Foundation raised much of the funding for the project by selling pre-orders of the DVD.

Smart appeals to the Governor to write him a good reference which he pretends to. Afterwards he writes his real recommendation which is very negative about Smart''s talents. The trustee who works as the Governor''s secretary, Faker Brown, "accidentally" gets the two letters mixed up and delivers the one praising Smart. On the basis of the letter, Lady Dorking, the who runs the Board of Governors appoints Smart to the job. This angers her deputy, Colonel Crableigh, who had favoured promoting his nephew, the Deputy head.
On his arrival at the school, Smart is treated to a boisterous reception by the unruly students led by the Head Boy, Cyril Brown, who is the son of Faker Brown. Narkover proves to be a breeding ground for young criminals, who prefer to spend their time playing cards rather than taking classes. After his initial attempts to stop their games, Smart himself ends up playing cards with the students. He gets off on the wrong foot with Colonel Crableigh but, in spite of Smart''s obvious incompetence, Lady Dorking immediately takes a shine to him. Crableigh begins engineering a scheme to have Smart dismissed and replaced by his own nephew.
Soon after his arrival Smart is approached by Faker Brown, just released from prison, who blackmails him into giving a job as a steward at the school. Brown has his eye on the valuable jewels of Lady Dorking, in particular her diamond necklace, which she is due to be wearing on Founders Day which takes place a few days later. It involves a dinner and a rugby match between the school''s old boys and the current students, with Smart persuaded to captain the school team.
On Founder''s Day, Lady Dorking wears her best jewels. In the Headmaster''s study, she is shown some conjuring tricks by Smart. Crableigh places Dorking''s necklace in Smart''s pocket in an attempt to incriminate him and have him dismissed. However, the necklace is then stolen by Faker who hides it in a decanter. After trying, and failing, to persuade him to give it back Smart takes it and hides it in a Jewellery Box due to be presented to Lady Dorking at the dinner..
Shortly before the presentation, the diamonds are again taken by the Head Boy Cyril Brown who picks the lock. He hides the necklace in a rugby ball, but before he can make off with it, the ball is taken by the referee in the match.

('tt0031077','free','Band Waggon (1940)','1940','1h 25min','Arthur Askey and Stinker Murdoch, two out-of-work performers, are living on the roof of the Broadcasting House in Central London. After being called in for an audition with the BBC three months before, they were forgotten about and settled down to live there waiting for their big chance. One day an item from their clothes line falls and hits Claude Pilkington, a senior figure at the BBC, who has them evicted. They are forced to pack up all their belongings and leave.
While driving home that evening one of the tyres on Pilkington''s car gets a puncture from broken glass lying on the road. It has been put there by the owners of the Jack-in-the-Box restaurant, who hope their cabaret act will be given a contract with the BBC and have so far failed to gain an audition. Pilkington sits unwittingly through their act, including singers Jack Hylton and Patricia Kirkwood, barely noticing it while he reads the newspaper. When he discovers that they have caused his puncture, he storms off in anger.
Meanwhile, Askey and Murdoch have found themselves in the countryside. Needing somewhere to live they go to a local estate agent hoping to pick up a cheap cottage. Instead they are offered a castle for £3 rent, which the owner is trying to get off his hands as it is haunted. After they settle down in the castle they begin to experience a number of sinister happenings which occur despite the estate agent''s insistence that there is a "perfectly natural explanation for everything". When they encounter Jasper Blackfang, a ghost who claims to haunt the place, they flee and take shelter at the nearby Jack-in-the Box restaurant.
Emboldened by the realization that the ghost is in fact the caretaker of the castle, who has been living there rent free, they return along with Hylton and Kirkwood. They discover a television studio inside the castle, which the caretaker claims is being used by a pirate commercial station. In fact it is being used by Nazi agents in Britain, but the caretaker is unaware of this.
Frustrated by their failure to secure an audition at the BBC, they decide to use the studios to broadcast their own show. Arthur Askey does a performance on the same wavelength as the BBC television station, interrupting a programme by Pilkington himself, who has to be faded out. Pilkington is furious by the interruption, but the pirate show generates huge interest amongst the general public. Pilkington, meanwhile, gets Scotland Yard to hunt down the pirate station. Their determination to find the station is boosted by the realisation that the castle contains plans of British planes stolen by the Nazi agents, which are unwittingly held up by Askey during his broadcast.
Askey has organised a major hour-long performance which ends in a finale with where the police, BBC officials and Nazi agents all converge on the castle, while a time bomb is ominously ticking down. The program is such a roaring success that the BBC are eventually forced to grant Askey, Murdoch and their associates their own show.','["Marcel Varnel"]','["John Watt","Harry S.

George, initially insisting the limit of his involvement is strictly as get-away driver, is coerced deeper into the plot by John Eagen (Crahan Denton), the calculating plot leader. Gino also succeeds in pressuring the reluctant George (George being burdened with responsibility for the expulsion of both Ann and himself from college) to reconnect with Ann to beg for a subsistence stake to tide them over pending the anticipated robbery booty. Tensions of dislike and distrust seethe within the gang. 
Ann, happening to spot Gino leaving the gang''s bank surveillance activity, soon extracts from George enough information to deduce that a bank robbery is about to occur. Dismayed, Ann attempts to derail the plot in hopes of saving George with a lipstick-scribbled warning on the bank''s window. The warning is however detected by the 4th gang member, Willy (John''s bullied but sneering minion from prison). John and Willy burst into George''s and Gino''s lodgings to extract the facts behind the betrayal. Gino, financially desperate to consummate the plot to avoid his own pending reincarceration, reveals Ann''s identity and past relationship with George. George is forced to take the gang to Ann''s apartment but is sent away, dubiously hopeful that Ann is being flown off to Chicago to silence her. Gino also abandons Ann on John''s orders. John, recalling his hatred for his abusive alcoholic mother, hurls Ann to her demise off the fire escape. Unaware of this murder, George is instructed that Willy is now the wheelman, forcing  the inexperienced George to a role inside the bank, but he meekly declines one final opportunity to withdraw from the plot.
The next day, the robbers commence execution of the heist, having neglected to bring a police-frequency scanner and unaware the bank relocated a switchboard from the lobby, foiling key aspects of the plan. The silent alarm is triggered and police swarm the bank exterior.  John is shot down attempting escape behind a female hostage. Gino, failing to find an escape route and hemmed in by prison-like bars, commits suicide in the basement vault. After momentarily considering to battle the police Willy flees, abandoning his partners, although identified and pursued. 
George, hobbled by a gashed leg, initiates a panicky escape behind another female hostage, but his spirit fails when the newly wed hostage''s husband summons the courage to offer himself in her stead. Having realized that Ann''s death was due to his own cowardly and naïve actions, he tries to surrender his pistol to a bank customer who disgustedly rejects the gun back to the sobbing and broken George. George is dragged away into a paddy wagon and the film concludes with his view of the world receding behind metal bars.',NULL,NULL,'["Steve McQueen","Crahan Denton","David Clarke"]','["Crime","Drama","Thriller"]','5.9','["tt0042340","tt0051987","tt0049571","tt0052870","tt0032843","tt0050225","tt0046546","tt0047674","tt0042052","tt0050213","tt0036287","tt0027311"]','["Steve McQueen;Crahan Denton;David Clarke;bank robbery;heist;Saint Louis;St. Louis;pdmovies"]','[{"url":"/Saint_Louis_Bank_Robbery.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Saint_Louis_Bank_Robbery_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/Saint_Louis_Bank_Robbery_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','Saint_Louis_Bank_Robbery',191691,'Q3139276','wp','["Richard T.

('tt0020321','free','Regen (1929)','1929','14min','Regen has four key elements that have cemented its place in documentary history: its place in the long career of director Joris Ivens, the Dutch Film Canon, the City Symphony film movement, and the history of avant-garde documentaries. 
Joris Ivens lived from 1898 to 1989 and in that time created thirteen noteworthy documentaries, whose interrelation and evolution loosely model the trajectory of documentary film as a whole. Over his career, he made art films, commercial films, political documentaries, war (and indeed anti-war) documentaries. His final film, A Tale of the Wind, was an autobiographical piece contemplating the divide between realism and fantasy.Additionally, Ivens was one of the inaugural voices of Dutch Film, establishing traditions in the form of content and formal effects that have continued to define films from the Netherlands. First among these is the painterly heritage of the Dutch. From the intimate realism of the Dutch Masters to Impressionism, Pointillism, and De Stijl, the Netherlands have a rich history of skilled and pioneering artists, including such household names as Rembrandt, Van Gogh and M. C. Escher. Ivens''s attention to composition is demonstrative not only of his three-generation family history of photography, but of his national heritage as well. Dutch films are inward-looking, that is, they feature Dutch subjects, Dutch settings, and Dutch conflicts, to include a love-hate struggle with the elements that has been a part of Dutch culture as long as the canals and windmills on which the Netherlands depends.Ivens also established a tradition of craftsmanship in the form of a rigorous organization of shots that likely owes its effectiveness and visibility to Ivens''s belief in the conclusions of the Kuleshov-Pudovkin experiment. The Pudovkin experiment led to one of the key tenets of Soviet Montage—that when cutting shots together, 2+2=5, which is to say a synthesis of two shots may incite a response independent of the response to either shot alone.Regen was one of the founding voices of avant-garde documentary, and perhaps the fullest realization of the filmic tradition of City Symphony. While often noted for their politics, the aesthetics of City Symphonies such as Alberto Cavalcanti’s Rien que les heures (1926), Walter Ruttmann’s Berlin: Symphony of a Metropolis (1927), and Dziga Vertov’s Man with a Movie Camera (1929) also attempt to arrest the viewer’s perception and create a highly formalistic visual poetry. While striving for what amounts to peak formalism, Regen differs from other city films in that its focus is subtly shifted from city life to the rainstorm itself, and how it transforms the city. Its subjects are numerous and anonymous, and few shots identify the setting of the film as Amsterdam, focusing instead on raindrops, clouds, and other small details of the rain’s interaction with the city.',NULL,'["Mannus Franken","Joris Ivens"]',NULL,'[""]','7.2','["tt0018728","tt0131468","tt0021576","tt0017668","tt0123318","tt0055715","tt0013427","tt0014406","tt0147039","tt0192102","tt0131461","tt0028030"]','["Documentary; Joris Ivens; Silent; Short; Dutch; Nederlands"]','[{"url":"/Regen.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/Regen_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/Regen_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','Regen',12999,'Q1057777','wp',NULL,'["Mannus Franken","Joris Ivens"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

No one can fathom why, not even spymaster Major Hammond (Ralph Richardson) or his sister Kay (Valerie Hobson), a newspaper reporter, who is working undercover in the works canteen at the Barrett & Ward Aircraft Company.
At first, Major Hammond is seen as an outsider at the aircraft factory, especially by Mr. Barrett, the owner (George Merritt), who is working under a government contract. Hammond soon finds a friend in star pilot, Tony McVane (Laurence Olivier), who helps him try to solve the case. Hammond becomes convinced that Jenkins (George Curzon), the company secretary at the factory, is a foreign agent and mole but Jenkins is killed by gunmen firing from a moving car before he can give up the names of his contacts.
McVane returns to the aircraft factory, determined to make the next test flight. His aircraft, like the others, is brought down by a powerful ray beamed from a mysterious salvage ship S.S. Viking, manned by a foreign crew. Although the nationality of the crew and agents aboard the ship is only implied, it was understood by audiences, "All of the crew speak with German accents and little doubt is left who the villains are", wrote Variety.The aircraft, McVane and the crew are taken hostage on Viking, where he discovers that many other missing airmen have suffered the same fate. Gathering up weapons, McVane leads the survivors in an attempt to take control of the ship. Major Hammond learns the truth and directs a Royal Navy ship (HMS Echo) to come to their rescue.

They are all members of the "52-20 Club," a government program which pays unemployed American veterans $20 a week for 52 weeks. Jimmy and his men "prove" to the government clerk that they are looking for work by placing an ad in the newspaper - "At liberty: combat crew. Four specialists eager and willing to drop bombs" - and receive their checks. 
The guys take Jean, whom Jimmy dubs the "Admiral", under their wing, showing her how to save money. For example, they open bank accounts in order to receive a free ceramic piggy bank and get their $20 checks cashed, then close their accounts without having to pay a fee. They sell the piggy banks to a pawnbroker for 25 cents each. The gang lives free in an empty aircraft factory because Jimmy is the night watchman.  Eddie (Johnny Sands) artfully makes their furniture out of aircraft parts and other war surplus.  They get their meals discounted for being stale or in trade, as when Mike (Steve Brodie) stands in for the lifeguard at a private club. Former taxi driver Ollie (Richard Erdman) drives them around in a sound truck from a local music store in exchange for providing advertising over a loudspeaker. All the while, Jean is secretly followed by a private detective.
When Jean learns that her fiancé Henry is returning to the United States, but has not even so much as mentioned her, she becomes upset and decides to get on a bus and go home to Walla Walla. 
Meanwhile, Jimmy is summoned to the office of Peter Pedigrew (Rudy Vallee), the "Jukebox King". It was Pedigrew who hired the private detective. He threatens to put the men to work, ending their idyllic lifestyle, unless they keep Jean from leaving for 24 hours. Pedigrew later explains that his ex-wife Shirley (Hillary Brooke) intends to marry Henry. Pedigrew wants to remarry Shirley (again) because, after two expensive divorces, she has most of his money, and he needs capital desperately to expand his business. Also, he is still irresistibly attracted to her, despite her being "so beautifully wicked". So, he wants the crew to help get Henry back together with Jean. Jimmy reluctantly agrees.
Jimmy races to the bus and gets Jean to stay by lying to her about Henry. As they spend time together, Jean discovers that the men are living with a dark secret. Jimmy feels guilty for Mike''s injuries when their airplane crashed during the war.  Jimmy, the former head of an employment agency, will not rest until all his crewmen have resolved things. Jimmy even takes Mike''s place in a boxing match, since the injuries could kill Mike, though Jimmy has never been inside a ring in his life before.
In the end, Pedigrew catches up with Shirley, Henry comes for Jean, and Eddie realizes he needs to go home to find out if his girlfriend will love him, even if he is poor. Finally, Pedigrew agrees to set up Mike and Ollie in business. So, that only leaves Jimmy, who by now is in love with the Admiral.

Gene rushes to Thorpe''s ranch, concerned that a hot-headed cattle rancher named Thad Morgan (George Chesebro) may try to kill Thorpe. Morgan was once ruined financially by sheep ranching. Gene is able to stop Thorpe from bringing in the sheep, and Thorpe agrees to send the sheep back.
Sometime later, Sandra Knight (Polly Rowles), who inherited the Knight Ranch from her late uncle, arrives in town with three female friends, who studied animal husbandry with her at the agricultural college. Before reaching the ranch, Sandra is approached by Thorpe''s partner Briggs (Al Bridge) who sells her the sheep. Continuing on to the ranch with the sheep, Sandra nearly hits Gene and his horse Champion. Learning about the sheep deal, Gene tries to dissuade Sandra from raising sheep, explaining that they eat grass to the root so that it cannot grow back, but Sandra doesn''t listen to him.
Instead of taking her to her ranch, Gene shows her to his own rocky ground and ramshackle cabin, telling her that it''s her ranch. That night, as the girls try to sleep, Gene''s friend, Frog Millhouse (Smiley Burnette), makes wild animal noises to scare the girls into leaving the next day. One such noise sends Sandra into Gene''s arms, and she asks him to sleep on the porch. The following day, Gene and Sandra go riding and come across the beautiful house and fertile land that is actually hers. Gene, who is falling in love with Sandra, is about to tell her the truth when she says she wants to lease the rocky land (Gene''s) for her sheep.
When Morgan learns about the sheep on Gene''s ranch, he rides there intending to shoot them, but Gene is able to stop him. Gene agrees to the sheriff''s demand that he remove the sheep from the area in twenty-four hours. When Gene notices Frog applying Mercurochrome to a wound, he gets the idea to paint the sheep so that they will appear to have hoof-and-mouth disease.
After Briggs discovers that Sandra believes she owns Gene''s ranch, he offers her $5,000 for her property—a bargain for Gene''s ranch, but far below the value of her own ranch, worth an estimated $100,000. When Sandra sees the painted sheep appearing diseased, she accepts Briggs''s offer to buy them, and Briggs delivers the sheep to Morgan. That night at the dance, needing to keep Gene from interfering while Sandra signs over her ranch without understanding the legal implications, Briggs tells Sandra about Gene''s trick. Angered by the ruse, Sandra fires Gene. Later, when Morgan confronts Gene about the sheep and draws on him, Gene pulls out his gun which fires before Gene pulls the trigger—Thorpe had rigged the gun earlier that evening. Morgan is wounded and Gene is arrested.
Sandra decides to accept Briggs'' offer to buy the ranch and tells her girlfriends to pack. After informing Gene about the sale, Frog helps him escape by putting up a wrecking company sign in front of the jail and paying a truck driver to pull the wall off the building. Pursued by the sheriff and a mob, Gene rides after Briggs and Sandra. After Sandra signs the deed over to Briggs, Gene pursues Briggs to the county seat and rips up the deed. The sheriff is informed that Morgan, after regaining consciousness, identified Thorpe as the one who shot him.

A woman sets the table for lunch, waiting for her daughter to come home from school. A wanted poster warns of a serial killer preying on children, as anxious parents wait outside a school.
Little Elsie Beckmann leaves school, bouncing a ball on her way home. She is approached by Hans Beckert, who is whistling "In the Hall of the Mountain King" by Edvard Grieg. He offers to buy her a balloon from a blind street-vendor and walks and talks with her. Elsie''s place at the dinner table remains empty, her ball is shown rolling away across a patch of grass and her balloon is lost in the telephone lines overhead.In the wake of Elsie''s disappearance, anxiety runs high among the public. Beckert sends an anonymous letter to the newspapers, taking credit for the murders and promising that he will commit others; the police extract clues from the letter, using the new techniques of fingerprinting and handwriting analysis. Under mounting pressure from city leaders, the police work around the clock. Inspector Karl Lohmann instructs his men to intensify their search and to check the records of recently released psychiatric patients, focusing on any with a history of violence against children. They stage frequent raids to question known criminals, disrupting underworld business so badly that Der Schränker (The Safecracker) calls a meeting of the city''s crime lords. They decide to organize their own manhunt, using beggars to watch the children. Meanwhile, the police search Beckert''s rented rooms, find evidence that he wrote the letter there, and lie in wait to arrest him.Beckert sees a young girl in the reflection of a shop window and begins to follow her, but stops when the girl meets her mother. He encounters another girl and befriends her, but the blind vendor recognizes his whistling. The blind man tells one of his friends, who tails the killer with assistance from other beggars he alerts along the way. Afraid that Beckert will get away, one man chalks a large ''M'' (for Mörder, "murderer" in German) on his palm, pretends to trip, and bumps into Beckert, marking the back of his overcoat.Once Beckert realizes that the beggars are following him, he hides inside a large office building just before the workers leave for the evening. The beggars call Der Schränker, who arrives at the building with a team of other criminals. They capture and torture one of the watchmen for information and, after capturing the other two, search the building and catch Beckert in the attic. When one of the watchmen trips the silent alarm, the criminals narrowly escape with their prisoner before the police arrive. Franz, one of the criminals, is left behind in the confusion and captured by the police; Lohmann tricks him into admitting that the gang only broke into the building to find Beckert and revealing where he will be taken.The criminals drag Beckert to an abandoned distillery to face a kangaroo court. He finds a large, silent crowd awaiting him. Beckert is given a "lawyer", who gamely argues in his defense but fails to win any sympathy from the improvised "jury". Beckert delivers an impassioned monologue, saying that he cannot control his homicidal urges, while the other criminals present break the law by choice, and further questioning why they as criminals believe they have any right to judge him by stating: "What right have you to speak? Criminals! Perhaps you are even proud of yourselves! Proud of being able to crack into safes, or climb into buildings or cheat at cards. All of which, it seems to me, you could just as easily give up, if you had learned something useful, or if you had jobs, or if you were not such lazy pigs. I can not help myself! I have no control over this evil thing that is inside me – the fire, the voices, the torment!"Beckert pleads to be handed over to the police, asking: "Who knows what it is like to be me?". His "lawyer" points out that the presiding "judge" is wanted on three counts of Totschlag (manslaughter, a form of homicide in German law), and that it is unjust to execute an insane man. Just as the enraged mob is about to kill Beckert, the police arrive to arrest both him and the criminals.

Barton has found a job as a test pilot for a millionaire named George Lambert (William Halligan) with his own aircraft company. When Doc brings a model of his invention, the two send their model aircraft to buzz Lambert on the golf course.  Lambert is fascinated and arranges a test, but his daughter Betty is not, especially when the model lands in a puddle and drenches her.
When the time comes for a test of the device installed in a real aircraft, Jerry takes the aircraft up and switches to remote control. United States Army Air Forces observers are skeptical that Jerry is flying the aircraft himself so Jerry parachutes out of the aircraft.  The device, however, is not perfected and the aircraft crashes.  The event is observed by foreign agents working undercover at Lambert Aircraft. Doc and Jerry return in failure to Arizona to perfect the device.
At the same time Betty announces she wishes to go to Hollywood, with her Aunt Maude.  When their vehicle runs out of petrol near Indian Springs, Arizona, the girls decide to steal petrol from an aerodrome beacon but are caught by Jerry who tows their car to Doc''s house.  As Jerry is a local Federal Aviation Administration official, he has the authority to arrest the girls until Judge Gildersleeve comes. The girls hear tales of his imaginary severe sentences. Jerry telegraphs George Lambert about what they have done and asks his permission to teach the haughty Betty a lesson. The girls have to do housework but Maude later overhears the boys'' scheme and wins them over by saying it is a great idea, as Betty spoiled since childhood, needs a comeuppance.
Meanwhile, the two enemy agents hijack a new Lambert-designed bomber being tested at Lambert Field. When the bomber crashes nearby with one agent (I.

He is also dangerously obsessed with Brown''s girlfriend, the suicidal Susan Lowell.  His main objective as a detective is to uncover what happened to a woman called "Alicia" from the crime boss''s past.
Mr. Brown, his second-in-command McClure and thugs Fante and Mingo kidnap and torture the lieutenant, then pour a bottle of alcohol-based hair tonic down his throat before letting him go. Diamond eventually learns through one of Brown''s past accomplices that Alicia was actually Brown''s wife. The accomplice suspects that Alicia was sent away to Sicily with former mob boss Grazzi, then murdered, tied to the boat''s anchor and permanently submerged. Diamond questions a Swede named Dreyer, who was the skipper of that boat but now operates an antiques store as a front, bankrolled by Brown. Dreyer denies involvement and does not want to disclose anything to Diamond, but is nonetheless murdered by McClure shortly after leaving his shop later that day.
Diamond tries to persuade Susan to leave Brown and admits he might be in love with her. He shows her a photo of Brown, Alicia and Grazzi together on the boat. Susan finally confronts Brown about his wife and is told she is still alive in Sicily, Italy, living with Grazzi.
Brown next orders a hit on Diamond. However, when his gunmen Fante and Mingo go to Diamond''s apartment, they mistakenly shoot and kill Diamond''s burlesque dancer girlfriend Rita instead. Diamond sees an up-to-date photo of Alicia but realizes it wasn''t taken in Sicily (since there''s snow on the ground). This leads Diamond to suspect Brown did not kill Alicia but his boss Grazzi instead. Diamond is able to track Alicia to a sanitarium, where she is staying under another name. He asks for her help.
Meanwhile, Brown''s right-hand man, McClure, wants to take over. He plots with Fante and Mingo to ambush Mr. Brown, but they betray and murder him.
At police headquarters, Brown shows up with a writ of habeas corpus, effectively preventing Alicia testifying against her husband. Brown also takes a big stash of "money" to Fante and Mingo while they are hiding out from the police, but the box turns out to contain a bomb that apparently kills both of them.
Brown shoots Diamond''s partner, Sam, and kidnaps Susan, planning to fly away to safety. However, Mingo survived the assassination attempt by Brown, so he confesses to Diamond that Brown was behind all the murders while sobbing over the body of his cohort. Alicia is able to help Diamond figure out that Brown took Susan to a private airport where he intends to board his getaway plane.
However, Brown''s plane does not show up and the film climaxes in a foggy airplane hangar shootout. Susan shines the fog lamp from Brown''s own car in his eyes, effectively blinding him, so the lieutenant is able to arrest him. The last scene shows the silhouetted figures of Diamond and Susan in the fog, considered to be one of the iconic images of film noir.','["Joseph H.

The next morning, reeling from his night of passion, Rath arrives late to school to find his classroom in chaos; the principal is furious and threatens to fire Rath.
Rath gives up his position at the school to marry Lola. Their happiness is short-lived, however, as Rath becomes humiliatingly dependent on Lola. Over several years, he sinks lower and lower, first selling dirty postcards, and then becoming a clown in Lola''s troupe to pay the bills. His growing insecurities about Lola''s profession as a "shared woman" eventually consume him with lust and jealousy. 
The troupe returns to his hometown and The Blue Angel, where everyone turns out to see the professor they knew play a clown. Once onstage, Rath is humiliated, not only by a magician who breaks eggs on his head but also by seeing Lola embrace and kiss the strongman Mazeppa. He is enraged to the point of insanity. He attempts to strangle Lola, but the strongman and others subdue him and lock him in a straitjacket.
Later that night, Rath is released. He leaves and goes to his old classroom. Rejected, humiliated, and destitute, he dies clutching the desk at which he once taught.','["Josef von Sternberg"]','["Heinrich Mann","Carl Zuckmayer"]','["Emil Jannings","Marlene Dietrich","Kurt Gerron"]','["Drama","Music"]','7.7','["tt0021156","tt0023458","tt0025746","tt0022698","tt0021800","tt0026276","tt0018737","tt0018839","tt0019071","tt0015064","tt0022599","tt0015881"]','["pdmovies"]','[{"url":"/TheBlueAngel.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/TheBlueAngel_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/theblueangel1930_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','theblueangel1930',79914,'Q158047','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

After a disastrous start he drives his ball into a nearby river but retrieves it after it is consumed by a fish. Meanwhile a convict escapes from a nearby prison and makes his way towards the golf course as the prison guards give chase. Buster''s ball is once again stolen, this time by a dog who takes it a long way from the court. Buster accidentally knocks himself after his ball ricochets off of an equipment shed and while he is unconscious, the prisoner switches clothes with him. The guards give chase and Buster attempts to escape by jumping into a passing car but it turns out to belong to the warden. Though he hastily jumps into another car, he ends up going into the jail himself.
Reading the prisoner number on Buster''s clothes he deduces that he is convict 13 who is scheduled to be hanged that very morning. Luckily Buster''s girlfriend replaces the hangman''s noose with a long elastic rope from the gym so that Buster bounces several times after the trapdoor is opened and he survives. The other prisoners are livid that they will not get to see an execution but the warden promises to hang two prisoners in the morning to make up for today''s botched execution. Later that day Buster accidentally knocks out a prison guard whilst smashing rocks and steals his uniform in order to escape. At the same time a rowdy prisoner revolts in the prison yard and knocks out each of the guards one by one. Buster accidentally stumbles into the prisoner''s path whilst escaping and the prisoner believes him to be another guard. Buster temporarily restrains the prisoner by closing the gate leading into the other yard but the prisoner quickly bends the bars of the gate and pursues Buster to the gallows where Buster restrains him by tying him up using the same elasticated noose used on him earlier.
Buster is "promoted" to Assistant Warden for his bravery but the now furious prisoner instigates a riot throughout the prison. The prisoner knocks out Buster, kidnaps his girlfriend and takes her out to the yard where the prisoners have completely overpowered the guards. Buster recovers and using a punching bag which he attaches to the elasticated rope, knocks out all of the rioting prisoners by swinging it around his head as they run around the yard. Buster celebrates but he accidentally knocks himself out when he leans on a sledgehammer which propels up and hits him in the head. However the scene then cuts back to Buster lying outside the equipment shed where he first knocked himself out being woken up by his girlfriend, the events of the short are all revealed to have been nothing more than a dream.',NULL,'["Edward F.

Her friends at high school, June Thompson, Francine Van Pelt, and Sally Higgins, are devastated and discuss among them the reasons for their friend to jump off the pier into the river like she did. Lucille''s death is investigated by the police, to rule out any alternative causes to Lucille''s death, and in charge of the investigation is Lt. Hanahan. He arrives to the high school, and the principal, Mr. Moffatt, is ordered to call the girls into his office for questioning by the police officer. One of the girls, Sally, doesn''t want to cooperate and answer the questions. 
Sally gets a ride home with her boyfriend Jerry Sykes, in his car after school. They stop outside of a department store on the way, parking right outside the building. Jerry goes into the store and robs it, shooting the owner in the process. Jerry speeds away from the crime scene with the police right behind him. With his careless driving, Jerry hits a pedestrian by the road outside of Merry-Go-Round, a club and teenage hangout. The club is owned by a gangster named Nick Gordon and his mistress Mimi, and the gangster tells Jerry to hide the car on his grounds. Nick lets Jerry and Sally come into his club to hide from the police. Hanahan arrives on the scene looking for Jerry and Sally, but doesn''t find them. Hanahan speaks to a news reporter on the street and tells him about what happened. Soon after, it is all over the news that a crime wave caused by juvenile delinquency has hit the town, and that it is caused by the loosening of family bonds. 
Sally meets up with one of the other friends, June, at the club. June is concerned that her father, Mr. Thompson, will start to worry since she is out so late. Sally calls June''s parents and pretends to be her own mother, inviting June to stay the night at the Higgins'' house. A while later June''s boyfriend, Rocky Webster, comes to the club and sells his father''s gun to Nick for five dollars. Nick then offers to drive June and Sally home. When June arrives home, her father is furious. He has talked to the real Mrs. Higgins and subsequently discovered that June has lied to him about the sleep-over. Mr. Thompson throws June out of the house, after first slapping her.
Feeling dejected and alone in the world, June walks around town aimlessly. Eventually she comes down to the river and is discovered by her boyfriend Rocky. In a desperate act to give consolation, and afraid that June is contemplating suicide, Rocky asks her to marry him. Before she can answer, Hanahan appears and arrests them both on the spot. Sally has met up with Jerry and they are on their way down to the river too, when they see Hanahan and their friends. Jerry pushes Hanahan into the river and June and Rocky escape. Jerry asks them to join him in robbing a nearby gas station, but they refuse to do it. Jerry and Sally go to the gas station together and hold it up. Since Jerry thinks they don''t get enough money, they rob a lunch counter as well. Sally and Jerry split up after that, and after Jerry has left, Sally alone robs a motorist. 
Hanahan manages to get up from the river, and still wet he finds Rocky and June, and takes them into custody. They are placed in front of the honorable Judge Craig for counseling. Hanahan tells the judge about June''s father''s violent behaviour and the judge cuts them both some slack, and decides to summon all the teenagers and their parents for a meeting. When they are all gathered, the judge lectures the parents on their responsibilities as such, and warns them about abusing their children.  
Both June and Rocky benefit from the judge''s lecture. Rocky begins to work in the evenings after school, trying to save up to buy himself a car. The effect is not the same on Jerry and Sally though. Nick hires Jerry on his gangster payroll, and uses him to rob a money transport. Jerry gets the gun Nick bought from Rocky, and Jerry uses Sally to drive the getaway car. The robbery doesn''t go as planned and results in a deadly shootout between Jerry and the men guarding the transport. Sally drives away with Nick, leaving Jerry to fight on his own, and he is shot down. When the police arrive on the scene, they find Jerry lifeless, with Mr. Webster''s gun in his hand. The police question Mr. Webster about the gun, and Rocky admits to selling it to Nick.   
Hanahan brings in Nick''s girl, Mimi, to the station for questioning. He tells her that the transport robbery was conducted by a man and a woman. Mimi thinks it was Nick and Sally who did it, and in a spur of jealousy she gives away both Nick and Sally. Hanahan drives off to arrest Nick, and Rocky and June follow in Rocky''s car. Mimi rushes back to the club to warn Nick, regretting that she told the police about him. Back at the club Mimi bumps into Sally. Mimi has a go at Sally, slapping her, but Nick intervenes and knocks her out. Nick takes Sally with him in his car. Rocky realizes that Nick is getting away from the police, so he takes a short cut and manages to force Nick''s car off the road and over a cliff. Nick is killed in the crash, and the town decides to remake the club to a wholesome place for teenagers to hang.','["Albert Herman"]',NULL,'["June Carlson","Fifi D''Orsay","Teala Loring"]','["Crime","Drama"]','3.2','["tt0041865","tt0071256","tt0147467","tt0046416","tt0086486","tt0075343","tt0080645","tt0043397","tt0125737","tt0029578","tt0032741","tt1723656"]','["Crime; Drama; Romance"]','[{"url":"/DelinquentDaughters.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/DelinquentDaughters_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/DelinquentDoughters_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','DelinquentDoughters',9168,'Q5253998','wp','["Arthur St. Claire"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

('tt0011130','free','Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1920)','1920','1h 22min','Henry Jekyll (John Barrymore) is a doctor of medicine living and working in London in the late 1880s. When he is not treating the poor in his free clinic, he is in his laboratory experimenting. Sir George Carew (Brandon Hurst), the father of Jekyll’s fiancée Millicent (Martha Mansfield), is suspicious of the young doctor’s intentions and often irritated by his tardiness and highmindedness. "No man", Carew observes, "could be as good as he looks." Following dinner one evening, Carew taunts his prospective son-in-law in front of their mutual friends and debates with him about the causes and effects of a person''s personality, insisting that every man is fundamentally composed of two "selves" who are in continual conflict. "A man cannot destroy the savage in him by denying its impulses", instructs Carew. "The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it." 

Reflecting on Sir George''s comments, Jekyll begins his research and experiments into separating the two basic natures of man, the good and the evil. Finally, after much trial and error, he develops a potion that rapidly transforms him into a hideous, evil counterpart, a man he refers to as Edward Hyde. When in the form and consciousness of Hyde, Jekyll is not recognizable as himself, so to facilitate his bad side''s access to his own home and adjacent laboratory, the doctor informs his trusty servant Poole (George Stevens) that Mr. Hyde is to have "full authority and liberty" at the residence.
Utilizing his potion, Jekyll literally begins to live a double life: the compassionate and gentlemanly doctor by day, and the lustful, hunchbacked "creature" who ventures out largely at night. As Hyde, he lurks about the seediest parts of London, frequenting opium dens, bars, and music halls—anywhere he can satisfy his "dark indulgences". He rents a small furnished room in the area and brings Gina (Nita Naldi), a young woman and exotic dancer, to live with him. Soon, however, Hyde tires of her company and forces her to leave.
Although Jekyll has developed a counter-potion that transforms Hyde back to the doctor’s original appearance and character, each time he takes the potion to become Hyde, the beast becomes increasingly more vile and physically more hideous. Meanwhile, Millicent worries about the absence of her fiancé, so Sir George calls on Jekyll, but the young man is not at home. Sir George then encounters Hyde in a nearby street, where the brute has just knocked a small boy to the ground and injured him. To make recompense for his actions, he goes and gets a check which he returns to the boy''s father. Carew notices that the check has been signed by Dr. Jekyll. He confronts Poole who tells him the story of Edward Hyde.
Hyde now returns to the lab; drinks the counter-potion and changes once again into his original form. Sir George finds the transformed Jekyll in the lab and demands to know about his relationship with Mr. Hyde, threatening to break off his daughter’s engagement to the doctor if he does not answer his questions. The threat enrages Jekyll, so much so that the stress itself triggers his retransformation to Hyde. Horrified in witnessing the change, Sir George flees out of the lab, but Hyde catches him in the courtyard and beats him to death with his stout, club-like walking stick. Hyde then runs to his apartment and destroys any evidence there that might link him to Jekyll. After barely avoiding the police, the creature returns to the lab, where he drinks the counter-potion and reverts to Jekyll.
In the ensuing days, while Millicent mourns over her father’s murder, Jekyll is tormented by the thoughts of his misdeeds as Hyde. Soon, the ingredient needed to make the counter-potion is depleted and cannot be found in all of London. Jekyll therefore confines himself to his locked lab, fearing he might become Hyde at any moment. Millicent finally goes to see him, but as she knocks on the lab''s door, he begins transforming into Hyde. Before he opens the door, Jekyll consumes poison in a ring he wears, one that he had taken from Gina. Now fully transformed into Hyde, he lets Millicent in, locks the door, and grabs her in his arms. Suddenly, he starts convulsing. Millicent runs from the lab and her shouts for help attract Poole, Jekyll''s longtime friend Dr. Richard Lanyon, and another friend, John Utterson. Lanyon enters the lab and finds Hyde dead, sitting in a chair. To his astonishment, he watches the creature transform into Jekyll.

('tt0053363','free','The Tingler (1959)','1959','1h 22min','A pathologist, Dr. Warren Chapin (Price), discovers that the tingling of the spine in states of extreme fear is due to the growth of a creature that every human being seems to have, called a "tingler", a parasite attached to the human spine. It curls up, feeds and grows stronger when its host is afraid, effectively crushing the person''s spine if curled up long enough. The host can weaken the creature and stop its curling by screaming.
Movie theater owner Oliver Higgins (Coolidge), who shows exclusively silent films, is an acquaintance of Dr. Chapin. Higgins''s wife Martha (Evelyn), is deaf and mute, and therefore cannot scream. She dies of fright after weird, apparently supernatural events appear in her room. During her autopsy, Chapin removes a tingler from her spine.
After they contain the tingler and return to Higgins'' house, it is revealed that Higgins is the murderer; he frightened his wife to death knowing that she could not scream because she was mute. The centipede-like creature eventually breaks free from the container that held it and is released into Higgins'' theater. The tingler latches onto a woman''s leg, and she screams until it releases its grip. Chapin controls the situation by shutting off the lights and telling everyone in the theater to scream. When the tingler has left the showing room, they resume the movie and go to the projection room, where they find the tingler and capture it.
Guessing that the only way to neutralize the tingler is to reinsert it inside Martha''s body, Chapin does so. After he leaves, Higgins, who has admitted his guilt to Chapin, is alone in the room. As if by supernatural forces, the door slams shut and locks itself and the window closes, echoing what happened just before Martha was frightened to death. The tingler causes the body of Martha to rise from the bed, staring at her husband. Higgins is so terrified that he is unable to scream. The screen fades, and Dr. Chapin''s voice says, "Ladies and gentlemen, just a word of warning. If any of you are not convinced that you have a tingler of your own, the next time you are frightened in the dark ... don''t scream".','["William Castle"]',NULL,'["Vincent Price","Judith Evelyn","Darryl Hickman"]','["Horror"]','6.7','["tt0055200","tt0054988","tt0053559","tt0051744","tt0053219","tt0045888","tt0052602","tt0058620","tt0055304","tt0056796","tt0056552","tt0056725"]',NULL,'[{"url":"/PhantasmagoriaTheater-TheTingler1959246-2_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/PhantasmagoriaTheater-TheTingler1959246.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/PhantasmagoriaTheater-TheTingler1959246_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','PhantasmagoriaTheater-TheTingler1959246-2',55759,'Q1557904','wp','["Robb White"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

While on guard at a Coast Guard post, Popeye, Olive Oyl and J. Wellington Wimpy hear of Hassan''s attack on a town in Arabia and fly there in their (literally) "flying boat" to capture him, but they crash as they are flying over a desert in Arabia. After trekking through the desert, the group happens upon the town where the Forty Thieves attack. The Thieves abduct Olive and Wimpy, and Abu Hassan leaves Popeye hanging from a chandelier after failing to win a battle of one-ups-manship with him (during which, demonstrating a magic trick, Popeye relieves Hassan of his long underwear, remarking "Abu hasn''t got ''em any more!"). Popeye manages to break free and takes a camel to Abu''s secret cave, where, unable to remember the magic word of "open sesame!", he breaks in using his pipe as a blowtorch.
Inside the cave (giving the Fleischers a chance to show their Tabletop 3D background process), Popeye sneaks past the guards and attempts to free Olive and Wimpy. He confronts Abu Hassan and demands that he gives the Forty Thieves'' stolen jewels back to the people. However, he is apprehended and thrown into a shark pit. Just before being eaten by a shark, Popeye tangles the shark''s teeth together, and the shark goes back down into the water. Popeye then produces his spinach, opening it by commanding the can "Open sez me!" Now super-powered, Popeye defeats Abu Hassan, and all forty of the Thieves (counting every single one as he does so). The Thieves and Hassan are chained and made to drag a cart filled with the stolen jewels, Popeye, Olive, and Wimpy, back to town, where the townspeople await them with open arms. Popeye turns to Olive and sings, as the film irises out:

He is given a worn-out baseball glove by a stranger impressed by his fielding skills.  As a young man, he becomes a multi-sport star at UCLA, but as he nears graduation, he worries about his future. His older brother Mack was also an outstanding college athlete and graduate, but the only job he could get was that of a lowly street cleaner.
When America enters World War II, Robinson is drafted, serving as an athletic director. Afterward, he plays baseball with a professional African-American team. However, the constant travel keeps him away from his college sweetheart, Rae.
Then one day, Brooklyn Dodgers scout Clyde Sukeforth invites him to meet Branch Rickey, president of the Major League Baseball team. At first, Robinson considers the offer to be a practical joke, as African Americans are not allowed to play in the segregated major leagues. When he is convinced that the opportunity is genuine, he and Rickey size each other up. After thinking over Rickey''s warning about the hatred and abuse he would have to endure without being able to strike back, Robinson signs with the Dodgers'' International League farm team, the Montreal Royals. Though he wants to delay marrying Rae to shield her, she insists on an immediate wedding so she can support her man in the trying times ahead.
Robinson leads the league in hitting in his first year, and despite the grave concerns expressed by the Commissioner of Major League Baseball, Rickey goes ahead and promotes him to the Dodgers. Reviled at first by many of the fans and some of his own teammates, Robinson gets off to a shaky start, playing out of position at first base and going through a hitting slump, but then gradually wins people over with his talent and determination. The team goes on to win the pennant, with Robinson driving in the tying run and scoring the winning one in the deciding game.
At the end, Robinson is invited to address the United States House of Representatives in Washington, D.C.','["Alfred E.

On the (fictional) island of Wongo she created a tribe where the men are brutish and ugly and the women are beautiful. She then creates a tribe on a nearby island called Goona where the women are repulsive and the men are strong and handsome. For years the two tribes lived unaware of each other''s existence, until ape men from across the ocean attack the village of Goona.
The tribe sends their king''s son to seek help against the invaders. The son finds the island of Wongo, the day before the village men pick their brides. The women, seeing the handsome prince, begin questioning their life among the brutes that dwell in the village. The men grow jealous of their visitor and plot to kill him. The women of Wongo, finding out about this, risk their lives to protect the prince, and in doing so offend the crocodile god of the Wongo people (portrayed by stock footage of a crocodilian and a rubber model). The women are rounded up by the village men and are sent out into the wilderness until the reptile god has drawn blood for the insult. The women band together, watching each other''s backs until the ape men arrive at their village and, after they dispatch the invaders to the god, leave in search for the men that had abandoned the island of Wongo. In Goona, the men have just begun their rite of manhood, in which they go into the jungle, without weapons, for a month. The women of Wongo, coming upon the weaponless men, decide to take advantage of their helplessness and, one by one, claim them in marriage. The film concludes with all the beautiful men and women married, and the ugly men with the ugly women.','["James L.

For the time being, Victoria is happy for them just to remain friends.
The Vickers family and Bert go off on their annual summer jaunt to pick hops in Kent.  Unknown to them, Victoria is being desperately sought by a solicitor to pass on the good news that she has inherited a fortune from the estate of a recently deceased distant relative.  There is a deadline for her to claim her bounty, but happily the solicitor tracks her down in Kent in the nick of time and rushes her back to London.
Under an unusual proviso in the will, Victoria must spend three years under the guidance of a society guardian in order to acquire the social polish and sophistication to go with her new wealth.  She is sent to live with the wealthy Mrs. Carrington (Ruth Mackay) and her son, but quickly starts to find the high life more restrictive and dreary than she had bargained for.  She is thrilled to receive a visit from Bert, but Mrs. Carrington is appalled by his lack of savoir faire and decides to send Victoria abroad for two years to finish her transformation away from Bert''s poor influence.  Before she is packed off, Victoria lends Bert a sum of money.
Victoria returns to London when the two years are up, now to all outward appearances the finished article.  Bert meanwhile has used the money wisely to build up a thriving and profitable business.  Now prosperous and respectable, he calls to repay the loan to Victoria, who admits that she is stifled in her new life and wishes she could return to her former East End happiness but in the circumstances does not think it possible.  She subsequently accepts a surprise marriage proposal from the Carrington son.
Bert reads of Victoria''s engagement in a newspaper, and is so upset that he decides to retire from active business and buys a cottage in the Kent countryside, to which he withdraws in solitude.  On the night of her engagement party, Victoria overhears her fiancé telling a female acquaintance that the only reason he wants to marry her is to get his hands on her money to pay off large gambling debts.  Horrified, she announces that she intends to break the engagement and give up her claim to the fortune, as she has realised that high society is not for her.  She returns to Poplar to look for Bert but cannot find him.  She travels to Kent, feeling nostalgic for the carefree times she spent there.  She happens to pass Bert''s cottage and he spots her from his window.

('tt0049857','free','Time Table (1956)','1956','1h 20min','Paul Bruckner, a surgeon whose license has been revoked for alcoholism, poses as "Dr. Sloane" aboard a train passing through Arizona. His presence there is part of a caper involving a fictitious patient, on whose behalf he gains access to his physician''s bag in the baggage car, whereupon he blows the safe and steals a cash payroll of $500,000. Bruckner and the "patient," supposedly infected with polio, are let off at a remote small town with a hospital, which is also far from any scheduled train stop, escaping with the money in an ambulance. The railroad officials do not discover the robbery until the train reaches Phoenix, many hours after their escape has been effected.
In response, the insurance company puts a claim investigator, Charlie Norman, on the case, forcing him to postpone his vacation to Mexico with his wife Ruth the next day. Joe Armstrong, a veteran railroad policeman who is also investigating the crime, works with him. Gradually evidence starts to turn up that the thieves stole the ambulance just before the robbery, then ditched it in the desert, escaping in a stolen helicopter. The scheme was thus elaborate, showing that the robbery had been carried out according to a strict timetable.
But there was one misstep that keeps it from being the perfect crime. During the escape the "patient," Lombard, accidentally shot himself, forcing Bruckner—and the money—to remain with him instead of escaping to Mexico, throwing off the timetable. Assigning Charlie to the case, a move by the insurance company unanticipated during planning of the crime, further disrupts the timetable and reveals to the audience that Charlie is the secret mastermind. Charlie carefully planned the crime after meeting Bruckner, who filed a false accident claim. Charlie plans to disappear in Mexico with Bruckner''s wife Linda, who pretended to be Lombard''s wife, using the cash to finance his new life. Bruckner, desperate for money, joined the crime strictly for the cash.
Charlie decides they should all wait for the investigation to cool off before trying to continue on to Mexico. However Joe, methodically investigating each aspect of the crime, finds an accomplice, who leads to another, Wolfe, the owner of the "stolen" helicopter. Charlie realizes that Bruckner and Wolfe double-crossed him, killing Lombard and planning to keep the money for themselves. Charlie kills Wolfe to silence him and makes it appear to be a suicide. Bruckner, trying to escape to Mexico with Linda and his share of the loot, panics during a routine customs check and tries to force his way across the border, but is killed by police. Linda escapes, and Joe arranges to go with Charlie to Mexico to find her, believing she has the rest of the loot.
Charlie sees an opportunity to escape, stashing his cut of the money in a briefcase to smuggle into Mexico. He suspects Bruckner had already arranged to leave Mexico for another country with Linda. However Charlie also discovers that an unsuspecting Ruth has tried to pull a practical joke on him, substituting fishing gear for his work reports in the briefcase, but discovered the stolen money and returned it anonymously to the insurance company. While tracking down Linda to take Bruckner''s place in the double-cross plan, Charlie draws the suspicion of Joe and the Mexican police, who close in. Forced to abandon Bruckner''s plan, Charlie and Linda are cornered and killed in a shoot-out.','["Mark Stevens"]','["Robert Angus","Aben Kandel"]','["Mark Stevens","King Calder","Felicia Farr"]','["Crime","Drama","Film-Noir","Mystery"]','6.7','["tt0041631","tt0039730","tt0036886","tt0038346","tt0042707","tt0047479","tt0042007","tt0049621","tt0043390","tt0039515","tt0039986","tt0039787"]','["film noir; train robbery; Mark Stevens; King Calder; Felicia Farr; Marianne Stewart; Wesley Addy"]','[{"url":"/Timetable1956.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Timetable1956_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','Timetable1956',65810,'Q7805121','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

While flying over the Pacific Ocean, their plane catches fire, splits in half, and plummets into the ocean; oddly enough, no one in Gary''s group is killed. We next see the group a few days later, suffering from dehydration on a life raft, before they finally spot a small island and stagger to dry land.
Shortly thereafter, they discover fresh water and decide to go exploring. They are quickly relieved to find a cabin, but delight turns to horror when they open the door to discover a dead man hanging from a gigantic spider web. According to his journal, the man was a Professor Green researching and mining for uranium, but he feared something terrible was about to happen to him. There''s no indication how long the professor planned to be on the island, but the women estimate there is enough food to last them about a month.
That night, Gary proceeds alone out onto the island where he is bitten by a giant spider and turns into some type of spider-man beast. He flees into the woods, leaving the women to wonder what has happened to him. The next day, seemingly possessed by uncontrollable violent urges, Gary kills one of the girls. The remaining women, still unaware of what has happened to him, have no idea that he is the one who has done this.
Twenty-eight days pass, and the women are running low on food when they spot a ship on the horizon. They are unable to signal it before it leaves, but two men arrive in a rowboat with supplies for the professor. They soon find the women, who tell them the professor is dead. As they all wait for the ship to return, they celebrate their last night on the island with a wild party. One of the men sneaks off to rendezvous with a woman, but both end up being killed by Gary. Finally aware of Gary''s fate, the remainder of the group hunts him down with torches until he flees into quicksand and dies. Yet before he dies, he releases his spider eggs, which are sent off into the island.','["Fritz Böttger"]','["Fritz Böttger","Eldon Howard"]','["Harald Maresch","Helga Franck","Alexander D''Arcy"]','["Horror"]','2.5','["tt0053611","tt0339716","tt0055304","tt0047507","tt0058208","tt0054673","tt0062946","tt0055946","tt0053095","tt0027824","tt0054691","tt0069091"]','["horror; sci-fi; MST3K; dubbed; camp"]','[{"url":"/Horrors_of_Spider_Island.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Horrors_of_Spider_Island_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','Horrors_of_Spider_Island',52998,'Q614812','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

It is also their first and last night before Horace joins the Army.
The couple decides to buy some champagne and celebrate. Horace leaves to buy the bottle while Millie dims the lights and changes clothes in the bedroom. Pete Mooney (Ernie Adams) and Joe Richmond (Lynton Brent) enter through a window, pull the unconscious body of Duke Keesler (Pierce Lynden) from under the bed and frisk him on the mattress until Horace returns.
Mooney and Richmond hurriedly cover the body and duck under the bed. Horace and Millie discover the body and run down the hall to enlist the help of the hotel detective, Pat Callahan (Warren Hymer). While they are gone, Mooney and Richmond stuff the body into Millie’s empty trunk, then escape out the window. When Horace and Millie return again, the body is gone, so Callahan leaves in a huff.
Horace opens the trunk and the body of Keesler falls out. Horace and Millie run to get Callahan, but Keesler is alive, awakens and escapes out of the window. Millie and Horace re-create what they found, accidentally locking Horace in the trunk.  Callahan and Millie leave to get spare keys and an axe to get Horace out. While they are away, Richmond and Mooney reappear and take the trunk away.
Mooney and Richmond take the trunk to Frankie Saxton (Tom Neal), a gangster looking for Keesler regarding a stolen $50,000. Mooney and Richmond leave Saxton with the case, thinking Keesler is still in it. The trunk is opened and Horace tries to explain a mistake has been made. Saxton, along with Skinny (Gene O’Donnell), Tubby (Jim O’Gatty), and Dotty (Barbara Pepper), think that Horace is Duke wearing a disguise. Horace escapes and runs down the street, only to be arrested for indecency and returned to the hotel.
Millie and Horace are snatched and coaxed to get into a car. They dodge the gangsters and hide in a movie theater, catching the tail end of the film with the lights coming on for a contest. Horace wins a prize before the audience departs. As he’s on stage, Millie is taken away by the gangsters. Dotty meets up with a frantic Horace and takes him to the rest of the gangster group, where they discover Horace really isn’t the Duke. They tie and gag he and Millie.
To get attention, Horace turns on the radio, which happens to be turned to a gangster show. Neighbors think the mayhem and threats are for real.

They can''t leave the defenseless child, so decide to take the baby with them, however, they argue over which of them would be better suited to raising the child. When Cash ends up prevailing in the debate, this creates a lifelong rift between the two friends.
Years later the baby has now grown into a young man, Bill Holbrook (William Boyd), who works with his adoptive father on their cattle ranch. Cash''s erstwhile friend, Jeff, has remained in the area where the infant was found and has established his own ranch, centered on the water hole where the entire feud originally began, a feud which is still in full force. Jeff lives with his grown daughter, Mary Ellen (Helen Twelvetrees). The feud escalates when Cash wants to use the water hole on Jeff''s property to water his cattle. Jeff is ready to confront Cash in a stand-off, preventing him from watering his cattle on the property Jeff has claimed, assisted by an itinerant cowboy, Rance Brett (Clark Gable), who has been smitten with Mary Ellen''s beauty. The confrontation is temporarily avoided when Cash''s herd unexpectedly stampedes.
When Bill discovers tungsten on Jeff''s property, he attempts to use it to close the division between his father and Jeff, however this only results in his father kicking him out. He turns to Jeff, and begins a mining operation, which actually has the opposite effect of Bill''s original intention, only exacerbating the tension between Jeff and Cash. Bill and Jeff''s partnership also causes tension with Rance, since Mary Ellen now shows an interest in Bill. After a shipment of tungsten which was on its way to pay the loan they had taken out to develop the mine is waylaid, Bill works furiously with the miners to replace it with another load. He is successful. However, as he is celebrating the success of the mine, as well as his impending nuptials with Mary Ellen, the mine is sabotaged by a series of explosions.
Everyone believes the mine sabotage is the work of Cash, but it turns out to have been an act of jealousy on the part of Rance, who confesses, leaving the two old friends to reconcile, and their two children to marry.',NULL,'["Tom Buckingham","Howard Higgin"]','["William Boyd","Helen Twelvetrees","William Farnum"]','[""]','5.1','["tt0022991","tt0021377","tt0033021","tt0023277","tt0022059","tt0024500","tt0021778","tt0021825","tt0021865","tt0030548","tt0023523","tt0022357"]','["Western; Romance; Clark Gable"]','[{"url":"/ThePaintedDesert.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/ThePaintedDesert_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/ThePaintedDesert_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','ThePaintedDesert',14679,'Q1401845','wp',NULL,'["Howard Higgin","Tom Buckingham"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Holmes and Franz fly to London, where Holmes places him under the protection of his friend, Dr. Watson (Nigel Bruce). The scientist slips away against Holmes'' instructions for a secret reunion with his fiancee, Charlotte Eberli (Kaaren Verne), and gives her an envelope containing a coded message. He tells Charlotte to give it to Holmes if anything should happen to him. Leaving Charlotte''s apartment, an attempt to abduct him by German spies is foiled by a passing London bobby.
Tobel successfully demonstrates the bombsight for Sir Reginald Bailey (Holmes Herbert) and observers from Bomber Command. Tobel, now under the protection of Inspector Lestrade (Dennis Hoey) and Scotland Yard, tells Sir Reginald that, although willing to provide the British with his bombsight, only he will know its secret and has a complex plan for its manufacture to keep the secret safe. He separates his invention into four parts and gives one to each of four Swiss scientists, known only to him, to construct separately and whose names are unknown to each other. Soon after, Holmes receives a call from Lestrade telling him that Tobel has disappeared. Holmes goes to Charlotte''s flat, where he receives Tobel''s envelope. Rather than the coded message, the message inside is from Holmes'' nemesis, master criminal Professor Moriarty (Lionel Atwill).
Disguising himself as Ram Singh, one of Moriarty''s old henchmen, Holmes searches the Soho district for information. He encounters two henchmen Peg Leg (Harold De Becker) and Jack Brady (Harry Cording), but is captured by Moriarty. Holmes is put into the false bottom of a sea chest, but is rescued when Watson and Lestrade observe the henchmen struggling with its unusual weight. Holmes returns to Charlotte''s flat to search for clues to the message''s contents. He finds impressions of the message left on a notepad page by immersing it in "fluorescent salts... and then photograph(ing) it by ultraviolet light." Holmes breaks the first three lines of a cunningly modified alphabet substitution code, which are the identities and locations of three of the scientists, but unable to break the fourth line, which has been altered as an added precaution, soon learns that Moriarty has murdered all three and stolen their parts. Meanwhile, Moriarty, also unable to break the fourth line, tortures Tobel for the name of the fourth scientist. Holmes deduces the change in the code and breaks the fourth line, identifying the scientist as Professor Frederick Hoffner (Henry Victor).
Moriarty accidentally deciphers the code. He sends agents to abduct Hoffner, who has the brilliance to put the four parts together should Tobel not recover from torture. The German agents bring the scientist, who is actually Holmes in disguise again, to Moriarty''s seemingly undetectable stronghold. Unknown to Moriarty, Holmes had the real Hoffner attach an apparatus to their car that drips luminous paint (which Watson helped prepare) at regular intervals. Holmes uses Moriarty''s vanity and pride to trick him into slowly bleeding Holmes to death "drop by drop", to stall for time. Holmes is saved at the last minute, however, by Watson and Lestrade, who with Hoffner''s help, successfully followed the drops. Scotland Yard apprehends the spies, but Moriarty escapes. When he attempts to complete his escape through a secret passageway, he falls sixty feet to his death; Holmes has discovered the criminal''s hidden trap door and left it open. With Tobel saved and the bombsight recovered, Watson notes that things "are looking up... this little island is still on the map".','["Roy William Neill"]','["Edward T.

In 1906, McCay began performing on the vaudeville circuit, doing chalk talks—performances in which he drew before live audiences.Inspired by the flip books his son brought home, McCay "came to see the possibility of making moving pictures" of his cartoons.  He claimed that he "was the first man in the world to make animated cartoons", though he was preceded by the American James Stuart Blackton and the French Émile Cohl.  McCay''s first film starred his Little Nemo characters and debuted in movie theatres in 1911; he soon incorporated it into his vaudeville act.  He followed it in 1912 with How a Mosquito Operates, in which a giant, naturalistically animated mosquito sucks the blood of a sleeping man.  McCay gave the mosquito a personality and balanced humor with the horror of the nightmare situation.  His animation was criticized as being so lifelike that he must have traced the characters from photographs or resorted to tricks using wires; to show that he had not, McCay chose for his next film a creature that could not have been photographed.McCay conferred with the American Historical Society in 1912 and announced plans for "the presentation of pictures showing the great monsters that used to inhabit the earth".  He spoke of the "serious and educational work" that the animation process could enable. McCay had earlier introduced dinosaurs into his comic strip work, such as a March 4, 1905, episode of Dream of the Rarebit Fiend in which a Brontosaurus skeleton took part in a horse race, and a May 25, 1913, Rarebit Fiend episode in which a hunter unsuccessfully targets a dinosaur; the layout of the background to the latter bore a strong resemblance to what later appeared in Gertie. In the September 21, 1913, episode of McCay''s Little Nemo strip In the Land of Wonderful Dreams, titled "In the Land of the Antediluvians", Nemo meets a blue dinosaur named Bessie which has the same design as that of Gertie.

McCay considered a number of names before settling on "Gertie"; his production notebooks used "Jessie the Dinosaurus".  Disney animator Paul Satterfield recalled hearing McCay in 1915 relate how he had chosen the name "Gertie":
He heard a couple of "sweet boys" [gay men] out in the hall talking to each other, and one of them said, "Oh, Bertie, wait a minute!" in a very sweet voice.  He thought it was a good name, but wanted it to be a girl''s name instead of a boy''s, so he called it "Gertie".','["Winsor McCay"]',NULL,'["Winsor McCay","George McManus","Roy L.

In following the judge''s order he brings his friend and collaborator Jefferson (F.E. Miller), and the two men go on a search for a new place to live.
Both lack professional experience and start thinking about what kind of jobs they might be apt for. Since they both agree on liking food, they decide on becoming food tasters. When they come to the first destination on the road, they pretend to be food inspectors and start stealing chickens from a farm, but the farmer (Nathan Curry) shoots after them. They meet a man of some wealth named Brown (Harold Garrison), whose car has stopped alongside the road, and his friend Dawson (Jessie Cryer).
While Brown''s chauffeur (Napoleon Whiting) runs along to find gas, the four remaining men start throwing dice. Washington and Jefferson win all the other two have, including the car, and they are driven by the chauffeur to a nearby country club run by Dr. Brutus Blake (Maceo Bruce Sheffield). Blake is a swindler, and when he sees the two men arrive in their elegant car, he decides to take them for what they have. Blake arranges a crap game where outcome is fixed to his advantage. Since Blake''s partner Blackstone (Arthur Ray) doesn''t approve of his tactics, they argue, and Blackstone threaten to reveal to the guests what Blake is up to.
Blake has a thing for the club hostess (Florence O''Brien), and later that night he sees Washington dance with her. He becomes jealous and challenges Washington to a fight. Blake manages to knock himself out during the fight, and when he wakes up he is more determined than ever to take the two guests money.
Everyone is unaware that the place is haunted by Blake''s dead relatives, and they are quite disappointed with how Blake has turned out. They also regret leaving the place to him in their wills and send one of them, uncle Ezra Dewey, to set Blake straight.
The gambling begins, and soon Washington and Jefferson has won the whole club from Blake through a bet. Ezra finds that the place is just as sinful and decadent under the management of Washington and Jefferson as it was under Blake. The former owners  start scheming to get the place back, and deciding to let the local sheriff arrest them for made-up criminal offenses.
Ezra finds out about Blake''s wicked plans and scares him off. All the ghosts then go on to scare off Washington and Jefferson, by haunting the club, and the two men flee for their lives.','["William Beaudine"]','["Lex Neal","Vernon Smith"]','["Mantan Moreland","F.E.

Wong discovers that she is Princess Lin Hwa, the sister of a powerful Chinese general, and that she was killed with a poisoned dart fired from a Chinese "sleeve gun."  
As with some of his previous investigations, Wong is given important information by the leader of a powerful tong (Chinese secret society). The tong leader tells Wpng that the princess had come to the United States with almost $1-million to arrange the secret purchase of airplanes that were to be smuggled into China. 
As Wong continues the investigation he learns that all the money that the princess deposited in a local bank has been paid out -- and that the signature on most of the checks is a forgery. Wong becomes the target of a killer, and is aided in his investigation by a blonde, beautiful and energetic newspaper reporter.
Was the princess killed by enemies of her brother to prevent the shipment of the planes to China? Or was she killed to hide the fact that there actually were no planes and the whole scheme was a scam? 
Wong''s careful conversations with the captain of the ship the princess traveled on, the owner of the aviation company that owned the planes she was going to buy, and the president of the bank where the princess deposited her money, result in him uncovering the identity of the killer.','["William Nigh"]','["Scott Darling","Hugh Wiley"]','["Boris Karloff","Marjorie Reynolds","Grant Withers"]','[""]','6.1','["tt0031704","tt0030473","tt0032457","tt0032404","tt0032903","tt0027440","tt0024968","tt0030470","tt0026199","tt0031147","tt0028708","tt0026197"]','["mystery; murder; crime; Karloff; Mr. Wong"]','[{"url":"/Mr._Wong_in_Chinatown.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/Mr._Wong_in_Chinatown_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/Mr_Wong_in_Chinatown_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','Mr_Wong_in_Chinatown',40631,'Q10332948','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Because it was billed as a comedy, the ending attributes the assumptions of the husband, including the murder, to eating bad lobster. After several lighthearted comedies featuring Mabel Normand and Roscoe Arbuckle, this seemed to be an added dimension to film genre in general, in that it attributed serious jealousy fantasies to human nature, but still managed to maintain a cheerful demeanor overall in its approximate 20 minutes.

Though possessing a photographic memory that enabled him to advance from private to senior non-commissioned officer in less than 24 hours, Dodo has one weakness: though his book knowledge enables him to give lectures on weapons disassembly and ballistics, he is gun shy and an incompetent marksman. After nearly shooting several of his fellow soldiers on the pistol range, with the actual target being the safest place to hide, Dodo is ordered to go into the woods to practice.  There his missed shots impress the picnicking colonel and his daughter Betty when Dodo accidentally shoots a hawk through the eye whilst in flight and after the colonel catches a fish who breaks the line and is in the process of rolling back into the water, an accidental discharge from Dodo''s pistol shoots the fish through his eye.  Eager to deflate the boasting Ames and Cobb, the colonel bets a month''s pay that Dodo can outshoot Ames and Cobb.

The first pig, using a prefabricated home kit, erects a wire structure, then quickly bushels straw over the structure for the house. The second pig uses hundreds of matches to make up his house. The third pig goes through the tedious task of laying bricks for his house.
After the first two pigs have quickly finished their houses, they start dancing around and laughing with each other. The wolf dresses as a gypsy, but the pigs are immediately suspicious and, when the wolf thinks he has them, the pigs instead ransack him and steal his outfit. The wolf then chases them to their respective houses. With the straw house, the wolf uses a lit match to burn the house, and with the match house, he drops a solitary match on the roof, causing the house to collapse. He tries to destroy the brick house by trying to knock down the door, as well as huffing and puffing and trying to blow the house down (to which the pigs respond by offering Lusterine mouthwash), but he fails at this attempt.
Once the first two pigs join the third pig in his brick house, the wolf again dresses up - this time as a homeless woman playing a violin, while it''s snowing outside (the ''snow'' actually talcum powder held above the wolf''s head on a stick). The first two pigs have pity on the wolf, and despite the third pig blocking the door, the two other pigs let the wolf in. When the wolf continues to play the violin, the third pig sees that the wolf has a record player hidden behind him. The third pig switches to the other side of the record, putting on a fast-paced dance. The wolf dances to this new tune, but loses his costume as a result.

On the way to their lodging, the couple''s coach passes Murder Legendre, an evil voodoo master, who observes them with interest. Neil and Madeleine arrive at the home of the wealthy plantation owner, Charles Beaumont. Charles'' love of Madeleine prompts him to meet Murder secretly in Murder''s sugar cane mill, operated entirely by zombies. Charles wants to convince Madeleine to marry him and solicits Murder''s supernatural assistance. Murder states that the only way to help Charles is to transform Madeleine into a zombie with a potion. Beaumont agrees, takes the potion, and surreptitiously gives it to Madeleine. Shortly after Madeleine and Neil''s wedding ceremony, the potion takes effect on Madeleine, who soon dies and is buried. Murder and Charles enter Madeleine''s tomb at night and bring her back to life as a zombie. In a drunken state, a depressed Neil sees ghostly apparitions of Madeleine and goes to her tomb. On finding it empty, Neil seeks out the assistance of the local missionary, Dr. Bruner, who recounts how Murder turned many of his rivals into zombies, who now act as Murder''s closest guardians. The two men journey to Murder''s cliffside castle to rescue Madeleine.
At the castle, Charles has begun to regret Madeleine''s transformation and begs Murder to return her to life, but Murder refuses. Charles discovers he has been tainted by Murder''s voodoo and is also transforming into a zombie. As Neil enters the fortress, Murder senses his presence and silently orders Madeleine to kill Neil. She approaches Neil with a knife, but Bruner grabs her hand from behind a curtain, making her drop the knife and walk away. Neil follows Madeleine to an escarpment, where Murder commands his zombie guardians to kill Neil. Bruner approaches Murder and knocks him out, breaking Murder''s mental control over his zombies. Undirected, the zombies topple off the cliff. Murder awakens and eludes Neil and Bruner, but Charles pushes Murder off the cliff. Charles loses his balance and also falls to his death. Murder''s death releases Madeleine from her zombie trance, and she awakens to embrace Neil.','["Victor Halperin"]','["Garnett Weston","Garnett Weston"]','["Bela Lugosi","Madge Bellamy","Joseph Cawthorn"]','["Horror"]','6.4','["tt0024894","tt0023249","tt0024188","tt0036027","tt0026912","tt0023293","tt0032390","tt0026685","tt0021814","tt0051744","tt0027800","tt0037549"]','["horror"]','[{"url":"/WhiteZombie_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/White_Zombie.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/White_Zombie_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','WhiteZombie',199197,'Q1751461','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

('tt0034711','free','Eyes in the Night (1942)','1942','1h 20min','New York private detective Duncan MacLain (Edward Arnold) is blind but has keenly developed all his other senses. He pursues his work assisted by his faithful guide dog Friday, his butler, Alistair (Mantan Moreland), and his assistant, Marty (Allen Jenkins). Retired actress Norma Lawry (Ann Harding), an old friend, comes to Mac seeking advice. Her headstrong 17-year-old step-daughter Barbara (Donna Reed), herself a promising actress, is enamored with her leading man in a small theater production, the much older Lothario Paul Gerente. Paul, who had once been Norma''s lover, has convinced Barbara that Norma actually wants Paul for herself and has only married her father Stephen for his money. At Mac''s urging, Norma tried to reason with Paul, but he insists that he loves Barbara and laughs her off. Barbara is equally disdainful of her and agrees to meet Paul for dinner that night at his apartment.
Norma''s husband Stephen Lawry (Reginald Denny) is a scientist leaving that night on a trip to test a secret invention on which he has been working for the government and the war effort. Worried about Barbara, she uses a pretext not to accompany Stephen and goes to the apartment. When Barbara arrives, she finds Paul''s dead body and thinks that Norma has killed him, even though Norma insists that he was dead when she arrived. Barbara threatens to call the police unless she leaves Stephen. Fearing that a scandal will hurt him, Norma agrees. Norma then turns to Mac, who goes to Paul''s apartment with Friday and Marty, only to find the body and the rug under it missing. A man (Stephen McNally) arrives to replace the rug and Mac hides in a closet, overhearing a telephone call to Norma''s number from "Gabriel" to "Vera." Mac accidentally gives himself away, but with Friday''s help overpowers Gabriel, who refuses to talk. Mac has Marty hide him to keep him under wraps.
Norma returns to her country home unexpectedly, which discourages an espionage ring that includes her butler, Hansen (Stanley Ridges), from breaking into Stephen''s safe and stealing his plans. They have killed Gerente, who was also an agent, and hidden the body. Mac arrives with Friday at Norma''s house and pretends to be her curmudgeonly "Uncle Mac" who has come for a visit. His blindness lulls any suspicions Hansen might have about him. Shortly thereafter, Barbara comes home from an "emergency rehearsal", called to get her out of the house by her director, Cheli Scott (Katherine Emery), who inveigles an invitation to spend the night at the Lawry home. Unknown to Barbara and Norma, Cheli is the ringleader of the spies. Cheli ordered Paul killed because his affection for Barbara was beginning to limit his effectiveness, and she immediately suspects Mac is not what he seems.
Gabriel''s wife Vera (Rosemary DeCamp), the Lawrys'' maid, is also a part of the plot. When Gabriel does not return home, Vera becomes hysterical with worry. Mac secretly asks Vera to meet him in the greenhouse, using her worry about Gabriel as a lure. She is observed by the others, however, and is killed by Hansen before she can reach Mac. The spies cut the house''s telephone wires so that Mac and Norma cannot call the police, and Cheli has Mac locked up under guard. Using his blindness as a distraction, Mac overpowers his guard and releases Friday out a window with instructions to "go home and get Marty." Stephen arrives home and Cheli threatens his family if he does not give her the final step in creating his invention, which was not in the safe. Barbara finally realizes how much Norma actually cares for her. Mac tries to stall for time, but is locked in the cellar. When Hansen goes to kill him, Mac has broken the light bulb and his advantage of total darkness helps him overcome the spy. Marty and Friday return with the police. When Friday is spotted by a lookout, Mac overpowers him and is saved from being shot by another lookout by Friday. After the spies are captured, Stephen and Norma are off to Washington, D.C., with Barabara remaining behind to care for her new "Uncle Mac."','["Fred Zinnemann"]','["Baynard Kendrick","Guy Trosper"]','["Edward Arnold","Ann Harding","Donna Reed"]','["Crime","Mystery"]','6.7','["tt0034941","tt0037263","tt0038409","tt0040765","tt0039787","tt0042648","tt0041088","tt0032022","tt0041523","tt0042007","tt0038697","tt0047479"]','["Crime; Mystery"]','[{"url":"/EYES.IN.THE.NIGHT_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/EYES_IN_THE_NIGHT.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/EYES_IN_THE_NIGHT_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','EYES.IN.THE.NIGHT',22559,'Q153613','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Gruesome takes him to a plastics manufacturer, where X-Ray (Skelton Knaggs) and a mysterious mastermind are in possession of a secret formula and hatching a sinister plot.
Ignoring a warning not to touch anything, Gruesome sniffs the gas from a mysterious test tube; he escapes the toxic fumes but collapses upon returning to the Hangman''s Knot and is taken to the city morgue, where his body stiffens dramatically.
Dick Tracy (Ralph Byrd) is at headquarters speaking with college professor Dr. A. Tomic (Milton Parsons), a scientist who suspects someone has been following him. At the morgue, Tracy''s sidekick Pat (Lyle Latell) has his back turned when Gruesome wakes up and knocks him out. Pat describes him to Tracy as looking a lot like the actor Boris Karloff (a gag cribbed from Arsenic and Old Lace).
At a bank where Tess Trueheart (Anne Gwynne) happens to be, Gruesome and Melody drop a grenade with the gas into a wastebasket; when it goes off, everyone but Tess freezes in place. They rob the place of more than $100,000 and shoot a cop on the sidewalk before Tracy and his men arrive. Gruesome demands half of the loot from X-Ray .... or else.
Tracy tries to learn the secret of the formula from Dr. Tomic''s top assistant, Professor Learned (June Clayworth), before going after Gruesome and his gang. Over the course of the film, Learned is shot dead, and Melody dies in a car accident. As an offhand comment, Tess quips "dead men tell no tales," which gives Tracy an idea: since Gruesome will resort even to murder to keep his secret weapon a secret, if he thinks Melody is alive, he will hunt Melody down to prevent any leaks. Tracy decides to run a false flag operation: put out word that Melody has been captured alive, and pose as Melody hoping Gruesome will show up. Gruesome takes the bait and abducts what he thinks is Melody from the hospital. In a climactic shootout at the plastic factory, Tracy shoots Gruesome in the back.
Tracy retrieves one last gas grenade with the intent of analyzing the contents. Back at the office, in the closing scene, the grenade inadvertently goes off, freezing everyone in place just as Dick and Tess are about to kiss.','["John Rawlins"]','["Robertson White","Eric Taylor"]','["Boris Karloff","Ralph Byrd","Anne Gwynne"]','["Action","Crime","Drama","Mystery","Thriller"]','6.2','["tt0038478","tt0037642","tt0039321","tt0028785","tt0032283","tt0042869","tt0041968","tt0035856","tt0033535","tt0043390","tt0059065","tt0038346"]','["Dick Tracy;Crime;Detective"]','[{"url":"/dick_tracy_meets_gruesome.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/dick_tracy_meets_gruesome_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/dick_tracy_meets_gruesome_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','dick_tracy_meets_gruesome',40652,'Q3706971','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Helene is kidnapped by the wizard Lodac, who brazenly informs her father that he intends to feed her to his pet dragon in seven days, revenge for the death of his sister at the same age as Helene is now: 18. George wants to go on a quest to liberate his lady love, but Sybil believes he is too young (he is 20). She tries to distract the youth by showing him a magic sword, a steed, an invulnerable suit of armour, and six magically frozen knights he will command when he turns 21. The impatient George, however, tricks Sybil and locks her in a cellar, then leaves with the magical implements and revived company of knights.
Sir George and his party appear before the king and insist on journeying to Lodac''s castle to rescue Helene, against the opposition of Sir Branton, a knight who had previously volunteered for the perilous quest. The king promises the rescuer his daughter''s hand in marriage and half his kingdom.
Seven curses bar the path to Lodac''s castle. First, they encounter an ogre, who slays Sir Ulrich of Germany and Sir Pedro of Spain before George kills him. When George tries to save Sir Anthony of Italy from being pulled under in a swamp, Branton treacherously comes up from behind and kicks him in as well. Anthony is killed, but George survives with the help of his magic sword.
Later, Branton meets secretly with Lodac. It turns out that Branton has Lodac''s ring, which the magician lost and wants back desperately, as his powers are crippled without it. The kidnapping was solely intended to make Branton look good in exchange for the return of the ring. When Sir Dennis of France happens by, Lodac prepares a trap. Mignonette, a beautiful Frenchwoman, distracts her compatriot, then suddenly turns into an ugly hag who attacks him. Fortunately, George saves him with his magic shield.
Lodac finally becomes aware that George is being aided by magic. He contacts Sybil and mocks her abilities. Stung, she tries to cast a spell to help George, but ends up inadvertently stripping away all his magical powers.
Sir Dennis and Sir James of Scotland perish when they reconnoiter ahead. Branton then leads George and Sir Patrick of Ireland into a trap, revealing his partnership with Lodac before sealing them in a cave with deadly green apparitions. Patrick, through the power of his faith, enables George to escape at the cost of his own life.
George sneaks into Lodac''s castle and rescues Helene, only to be captured. The magician gives Helene (actually the hag in disguise) to Branton, but once he has the ring, he uses magic to put Branton''s head on a plaque on the wall. George is tied up, but escapes with the help of escaped shrunken prisoners. Sybil arrives and finally remembers the spell that restores George''s powers, enabling him to slay the two-headed dragon and save Helene. Sybil steals the ring while Lodac is distracted. When the magician threatens the young couple with the seventh curse - himself - Sybil transforms herself into a large panther and kills him. Helene and George get married. When the six knights are restored to life, George''s happiness is complete.','["Bert I. Gordon"]','["Bert I. Gordon","Bernard C.

When he goes shopping at a lingerie store to buy some sexier clothes for her, he meets Sally, the shop girl. Rejected by his wife for a night out on the town, he takes Sally, who douses him with her perfume. When Beth smells another woman''s perfume, she kicks him out and files for divorce.
Beth''s Aunt Kate takes her shopping to get her mind off of her broken heart. While in the dress shop, Beth overhears women gossiping about how her dull appearance led to her losing her husband. She determines to "play their game" and gets a new "indecent" wardrobe. Meanwhile the manipulative Sally convinces the dejected Robert to marry her. He finds that his second wife annoys him as much as his previous one.
Later the couple and their dog end up at the same luxury hotel where divorcee Beth is strutting her stuff. She tries to seduce Robert, but he resists. Each of them quickly leaves the situation, but they meet again on a train. As they''re walking away from the station, Robert slips on a banana peel. When the police arrive on the scene, Beth identifies Robert as her husband and takes him home. Doctors say he is to be kept quiet for 24 hours.
The two women argue over whether Sally will move Robert against doctor''s orders. Beth locks the three of them into the bedroom, which leads to a physical struggle over the key during which Sally breaks a mirror, inviting seven years'' bad luck. Beth threatens to burn Sally''s face with acid, which leads to a stalemate. The three stay in the room until Robert''s crisis is over. A doctor pronounces him healthy, but Robert refuses to go home with Sally. Sally throws the vial of acid on Beth''s face only to discover that Beth was bluffing; the vial contained only eye wash.
Sally leaves but not before taking the cash from Robert''s pants pockets and declaring that the best thing about marriage is alimony.
The final scenes show the remarried Robert and Beth in their home. Beth dresses up in more revealing clothes and replaces the classical recording on her Victrola with a record of the foxtrot. Sally has taken up with a violin player. The intertitle that ends the film reassures ladies that their husbands would prefer them as sweethearts, and reminds them to make sure they remember, from time to time, to "forget" being a wife.','["Cecil B.

Fluent in Romanian and German and having studied chemical engineering, he is parachuted into Romania to assume the identity of Captain Jan Tartu, a member of the fascist Iron Guard. He makes his way to Czechoslovakia to steal the formula of a new Nazi poison gas and sabotage the chemical plant where it is being manufactured.
However, his contact is arrested before he can arrange for a job in the factory. Tartu is instead assigned work as a foreman at a munitions factory, where he is issued a German uniform. He is billeted in the house of Anna Palacek (Phyllis Morris) and her daughter Pavla (Glynis Johns), who works in the plant; also living there are German Inspector Otto Vogel (Walter Rilla) and the lovely Maruschuka Lanova (Valerie Hobson), who lives well by making herself popular with the German officers.
That day Pavla shoots a German who earlier had had the man she loved executed. Tartu provides her with an alibi, winning her trust, and then reveals himself as a secret agent. Needing to get into the chemical plant, he asks her help to contact the Czech underground, and is surprised when she contrives for him and Maruschuka to go on a date. They talk guardedly but make it clear they are both working against the Nazis.
At work the next day, Pavla is seen attempting sabotage. She whispers to Tartu to protect himself by denouncing her. He does, and she is summarily executed. The factory manager rewards Tartu by arranging the transfer he wants, to the chemical plant.
The same day, Maruschuka contacts Dr. Novotny (Martin Miller), the leader of the local resistance group, and says she trusts Tartu. However they have already concluded that he had saved Pavla as a trick to win the confidence of the underground and order him killed. To arrange this while avoiding the execution of 200 Czechs by the Nazis in retribution, Maruschuka returns home and comes on seductively to Vogel. She tells him she''s sure Tartu is a spy and Vogel says he will call the Gestapo. But she suggests Vogel advance his career by taking the initiative and killing Tartu himself. Vogel wants evidence, so she goes out again with Tartu that night, so that Vogel can overhear them talking. But they are interrupted before this can happen.
The next day, Tartu goes to work for Dr. Willendorf (Percy Walsh), the head of the chemical plant. He is dismayed to learn that the first shipment of gas is scheduled for the following night. Desperate to reach the resistance, he pretends to get drunk in a bar and brags that he knows of six Czech resistance members about to be arrested and killed. His idea works: he is abducted by the underground, and with a great deal of effort, finally convinces them they are on the same side. Working all night, they manufacture enough miniature bombs to demolish the plant if properly placed.

At the Palacek house, Vogel checks up on Tartu''s credentials and happily informs Maruschuka that Tartu is indeed a spy. She believes Vogel and, trying to stop him telling anyone else, accidentally kills him. She hurries to the chemical plant to warn Tartu that he is in danger. He sounds an air raid alarm and runs through the plant setting the bombs in their places. The Germans quickly realize he is a saboteur, but he just manages to complete his task and escape from the heavily guarded plant, which blows up as he is driven away.
Finally he, Maruschuka, and a pilot steal a German bomber and fly to safety as he proposes "just a simple little wedding".','["Harold S.

His obsession with rigid drill, instant obedience and martinet discipline extends not only to his soldiers but also to his courtiers and even the servants who scrub the palace corridors. A slip of the pen by an army clerk when drawing up a list of officers for promotion, leads to the creation of a Lieutenant Kijé. Once the document is signed by the Emperor, Kijé takes on an existence of his own.  The Emperor''s aide cries out when engaged in amorous play with Princess Gagarina''s companion, awakening the sleeping Paul. The non-existent Lieutenant Kijé is blamed, flogged in front of the assembled Imperial Guard and sent under escort to a fortress in Siberia. His lack of substantive form is explained by his being "a confidential prisoner with no shape". Reprieved by the Emperor at the request of Princess Gagarina, Kijé returns to Saint Petersburg and is rapidly promoted to colonel and then general. In absentia, he marries the lady in waiting. At last, when the Emperor insists on a meeting with his "most faithful servant", General Kijé is reported as having died.  The Czar orders a state funeral, not knowing the coffin is empty.  
In an ironic twist ending, the Emperor is made to believe that his favorite officer was an embezzler after a note reading "General Kijé spent the money on meals" (deliberately left by the Emperor''s aide) is found in the empty state treasury chest. The furious Paul then remembers that it was Kijé who originally disturbed his sleep. The "deceased" is demoted to the rank of private and the Emperor''s aide is promoted to the rank of general, embracing Princess Gagarina''s companion after the funeral for her disgraced husband is canceled.','["Aleksandr Faintsimmer"]',NULL,'["Mikhail Yanshin","Boris Gorin-Goryainov","Nina Shaternikova"]','[""]','6.5','[]','["Kije;Kijé;Киже;Prokofiev;Russian;Russia;Tynyanov;Poruchik;Поручик;Прокофьев;Tsar"]','[{"url":"/LieutenantKizhe_0_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/Lieutenant_Kizhe_English_subtitles.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/Lieutenant_Kizhe_English_subtitles_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','LieutenantKizhe_0',18145,'Q1112886','wp','["Yuri Tynyanov"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Crushed, Eegah follows them back to civilization, a final confrontation ensues, and Eegah is killed.','["Arch Hall Sr."]','["Bob Wehling","Arch Hall Sr."]','["Arch Hall Jr.","Marilyn Manning","Richard Kiel"]','["Adventure","Comedy","Fantasy","Music"]','2.2','["tt0057181","tt0052646","tt0053337","tt0057465","tt0052969","tt0053677","tt0054462","tt0054668","tt0050530","tt0047149","tt0130236","tt0045546"]','["caveman; Arch Hall; Richard Kiel; MST3K"]','[{"url":"/Eegah.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Eegah_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/Eegah_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','Eegah',48808,'Q2113568','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

He goes about his job in the usual comic Chaplin manner: insulting various eccentric customers and dusting an electric fan while it is running. Quarreling over a ladder, Chaplin engages in a slapstick battles with his fellow pawnshop assistant and is fired.  The pawnbroker gives Charlie a second chance because of his "eleven children"--a fiction which Charlie has hastily invented for the occasion.  In the kitchen Charlie flirts with the pawnbroker''s attractive daughter, helping her dry dishes by passing them through a clothes wringer.  When a customer brings in an alarm clock to be pawned, Chaplin engages in one of his most famous solo sustained comedy bits:  He thoroughly examines the clock as if he were a physician and a jeweler.  He disassembles the clock piece by piece, damaging it beyond repair, and carefully puts the pieces into the man''s hat.  He then sorrowfully informs him that the clock can not be accepted.
A crook enters the store and pretends he wants to buy diamonds.  Charlie, who has hidden in a trunk after another raucous dispute with his co-worker, spots the man trying to open the pawnshop''s vault.  Charlie emerges from the trunk, knocks the armed thief out. Charlie is congratulated by the pawnbroker and embraced by his daughter for his bravery and good deed.
The role of the pawnshop proprietor was Henry Bergman''s first major appearance in a Chaplin film.  (He had played a minor, uncredited role as an old man in The Floorwalker earlier in 1916.)  Bergman would work closely with Chaplin until his death in 1946.','["Charles Chaplin"]',NULL,'["Charles Chaplin","Henry Bergman","Edna Purviance"]','[""]','7.1','["tt0007264","tt0006548","tt0006689","tt0006414","tt0006684","tt0007613","tt0007507","tt0007832","tt0007880","tt0008133","tt0007194","tt0006177"]','["Charlie Chaplin; Silents"]','[{"url":"/CC_1916_10_02_ThePawnshop_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/CC_1916_10_02_ThePawnshop_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','CC_1916_10_02_ThePawnshop',435647,'Q1140172','wp','["Charles Chaplin"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Residing deep within a Moon cavern, where they have managed to maintain not only the remnants of a breathable atmosphere and Earth-like gravity, but also a pair of gigantic Moonspiders, the cat-women wear black unitards, have beehive hairstyles, and wear elaborate cosmetics. Realizing that their remaining atmosphere will soon be exhausted, the cat-women plan to steal the expedition''s spaceship, migrate to Earth, and in the words of the cat-women''s queen, Alpha (Carol Brewster), "We will get their women under our power, and soon we will rule the whole world"!
Through the use of their telepathic abilities, the cat-women have been subliminally controlling Helen Salinger (Marie Windsor), the mission navigator and only female member of the Earth expedition. Once on the Moon, the cat-women take control of Helen''s mind, after which she leads the entire crew (clad in spacesuits and equipped with matches, cigarettes, and a gun) to the cat-women''s cavern. Although unable to directly control male minds, the cat-women are able to influence the male crew through Helen, using their own superior intellectual abilities and feminine wiles. As explained to Helen by the cat-woman Beta (Suzanne Alexander), "Show us their weak points. We''ll take care of the rest".
Along with telepathy, the cat-women can transport themselves, unseen and instantly, from place-to-place within the cavern. They use this ability to steal the crew''s unguarded spacesuits. This forces the crew deeper into the cavern and into violent confrontations with the two moon-spiders and the cat-women. Failing to exterminate the men, the cat-women approach them openly, using Helen. Kip (Victor Jory), who has always been suspicious of the cat-women, confronts Alpha about the missing spacesuits. She promises to return them in the morning. Food and drink are then brought, and private conversations between both groups begin. As these progress ("You''re too smart for me, baby. I like ''em stupid"), the gun-wielding Kip sits alone, unable to intervene, while the cat-women successfully manipulate expedition commander Laird (Sonny Tufts) and the other men.
By that evening, the cat-women have learned how to pilot the spaceship. Walt (Douglas Fowley) is stabbed to death by Beta. Lambda (Susan Morrow) has fallen in love with crew member Doug (William Phipps) and tells him of the cat-woman plot, saying, "I love you Doug, and I must kill you". The male crew now realizes that they are in danger. Carrying three spacesuits, Alpha, Beta, and Helen make a break for the spaceship. Lambda teleports ahead to delay them and is bludgeoned to death by Beta. Kip catches up, and fires several shots, killing Alpha and Beta, but leaving Helen uninjured. The surviving expedition members escape the cavern, reach their spaceship, and return to Earth.','["Arthur Hilton"]','["Roy Hamilton","Jack Rabin"]','["Sonny Tufts","Victor Jory","Marie Windsor"]','["Adventure","Sci-Fi"]','3.9','["tt0046248","tt0043545","tt0053072","tt0047898","tt0050147","tt0045917","tt0050545","tt0050210","tt0052077","tt0049370","tt0051947","tt0050393"]','["Sci-Fi; Cat-Women; Sonny Tufts; B-Grade; Elmer Bernstein"]','[{"url":"/CatWomenOfTheMoon.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/CatWomenOfTheMoon_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/Cat_Women_of_the_Moon_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','Cat_Women_of_the_Moon',101310,'Q3284402','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The escort bureau is managed by Breeze Nolan (Guy Kingsford) who provides customers with both male and female escorts.
Ruth has a daughter, June (Margaret Marquis), who is ignorant of her mother''s occupation. June believes that her mother works in real estate. Ruth had sent her daughter to a private school in the eastern U.S. Eventually June is engaged to Drake Hamilton (Robert Kellard), and when Drake travels to Los Angeles for work, June decides to accompany him to meet her mother. At the same time, Ruth and her partner learn  that the district attorney is planning to put an end to illegal escort services. Since her daughter is coming to town, Ruth is  concerned that the truth will come out about her business. She grows more worried when she discovers that Drake is in Los Angeles to assist the district attorney in stopping all escort operations.
In the line of duty Drake pretends to be a prospective client and calls the bureau to book a girl for the evening. His plan is to lay a trap for the bureau owners. But Stone learns from a snitch that Drake is investigating, and instead of sending a regular girl, he sends June to Drake''s hotel room at the specified time. Drake ends up believing that June works as an escort girl and breaks their engagement. June is devastated and blames Stone for what happened. She  threatens to go to the DA. To stop her and exculpate himself, Stone reveals that Ruth is his partner. He tries to hire June as an escort girl after plying her with drinks.

A sub-plot involves his elderly father''s allowing an oil company to drill for oil in the inlet that runs behind their house. A completely assembled miniature oil rig on a slender barge is towed into the inlet from connecting narrow waterways. Although there is a moment of crisis when the rig strikes a gas pocket, most of this is dealt with swiftly and off-camera, and the barge, rig, and friendly drillers depart expeditiously, leaving behind a phenomenally clean environment and a wealthy Cajun family.
Conflict and action for the plot is provided by the presence of a giant alligator in the area, which is believed to have eaten the pet raccoon and which is hunted in revenge. There is no individual or organized resistance to the incursion of the oil seekers, even after the (brief, offscreen) disaster, who are unequivocally portrayed as friendly, progressive humanitarians.
The boy, named in the film as Alexander Napoleon Ulysses Le Tour, but in the credits just identified as "the boy", was played by Joseph Boudreaux.

('tt0063555','free','Sayat Nova (1969)','1969','1h 19min','The Color of Pomegranates is a biography of the Armenian ashug Sayat-Nova (King of Song) that attempts to reveal the poet''s life visually and poetically rather than literally. The film is presented with little dialogue using active tableaux which depict the poet''s life in chapters: Childhood, Youth, Prince''s Court (where he falls in love with a tsarina), The Monastery, The Dream, Old Age, The Angel of Death and Death.  There are sounds and music and occasional singing but dialogue is rare. Each chapter is indicated by a title card and framed through both Sergei Parajanov''s imagination and Sayat Nova''s poems. Actress Sofiko Chiaureli notably plays six roles in the film, both male and female. According to Frank Williams, Parajanov''s film celebrates the survival of Armenian culture in face of oppression and persecution, "There are specific images that are highly charged — blood-red juice spilling from a cut pomegranate into a cloth and forming a stain in the shape of the boundaries of the ancient Kingdom of Armenia; dyers lifting hanks of wool out of vats in the colours of the national flag, and so on".Parajanov, the director, said his inspiration was "the Armenian illuminated miniatures," and that he "wanted to create that inner dynamic that comes from inside the picture, the forms and the dramaturgy of colour." He also described this film as a series of Persian miniatures.His close friend Mikhail Vartanov has maintained that Parajanov''s misunderstood cinematic language is "simple and only appears to be complex" and he partly demystified it in Parajanov: The Last Spring.Some Russian versions of The Color of Pomegranates have Special Edition features. The Memories of Sayat Nova, by Levon Grigoryan, is a 30 mins synopsis that explains what is happening in the tableaux and in each chapter of the poet''s life. G. Smalley asserts that every carefully composed image in The Color of Pomegranates is coded to a meaning, but the key to interpreting them is missing.

('tt0036629','free','The Battle of Russia (1943)','1943','1h 23min','The film begins with an overview of previous failed attempts to conquer Russia: by the Teutonic Knights in 1242 (footage from Sergei Eisenstein''s film Alexander Nevsky is used here), by Charles XII of Sweden in 1704 (footage from Vladimir Petrov''s film Peter the Great), by Napoleon I in 1812, and by the German Empire in World War I.
The vast natural resources of the Soviet Union are then described, showing why the land is such a hot prize for conquerors. To give a positive impression of the Soviet Union to the American audience, the country''s ethnic diversity is covered in detail and, later on, elements of Russian culture familiar to Americans, including the musical compositions of Tchaikovsky and Leo Tolstoy''s book War and Peace, are also mentioned. Communism is never mentioned at any point in the film; instead, the Russian Orthodox Church is described as a force opposing Nazism. The start of the film includes a quote from U.S. Gen. Douglas MacArthur, who commended the Russian people''s defense of their nation as one of the most courageous feats in military history.
The film then covers the Nazi conquests in the Balkans, described as a preliminary to close off possible Allied counter-invasion routes, before the war against Russia was launched on June 22, 1941. The narration describes the German "keil und kessel" tactics for offensive warfare, and the Soviet "defense in depth" used to counter this. The scorched earth Soviet tactics, the room-to-room urban warfare in Soviet cities, and the guerilla warfare behind enemy lines are also used to underline the Soviet resolve for victory against the Germans. The Siege of Leningrad and the Battle of Stalingrad conclude the film.
The episode, like other entries in the Why We Fight series, omits many facts that could have cast the Soviet Union in a negative light, such as its occupation of the Baltic States, its war against Finland, its occupation and subsequent atrocities against the population of Poland, and its occupation of Romanian territory. The film also does not mention the word "Communism."Virtually in line with Soviet propaganda, the series was not only screened but widely acclaimed in the Soviet Union. The episode has been described as "a blatant pro-Soviet propaganda posing as factual analysis" and was withdrawn from circulation during the Cold War. Capra commented about why certain material was left out:
We had a political problem with Russia on that film. The problem was that a hell of a lot of people on our side were not about to be sold a bill of goods by the Communists. We were their allies, but that was all. Communism was not something we desired. So we stayed a way from politics and made it a people''s battle. As a result, The Battle of Russia was one of the best episodes of the series and a true one.',NULL,'["Julius J. Epstein","Philip G.

On the train he is robbed and then thrown from the train by escaped murderer Wolf Benson (Boothe Howard). Believing Gene to be dead, Wolf plans to travel to Mineral Springs Ranch and pose as the radio celebrity in order to collect the $10,000 that Lee owes Gene.
Meanwhile, Gene is rescued by traveling actors Frog Millhouse (Smiley Burnette) and Professor Ezekial Daniels (Earle Hodgins). Together they travel to Sage City, where Gene gets into a fight with Sheriff Briggs (Walter James), who believes he is Wolf, and chokes the singing cowboy. Arrested for Wolf''s crimes, Gene is unable to sing in order to prove his identity. At the trial, Gene mouths the words to his songs while a phonograph plays, and after the jury listens, Gene is set free.
Wolf arrives at Lee''s Mineral Springs Ranch pretending to be Gene and asks for his money back. Knowing he is an impostor, Lee refuses to give him the money and Wolf shoots him and robs his safe. On his way to Mineral Springs, Gene comes across a posted reward for "Gene Autry", the murderer of Jefferson Lee. Gene meets Lee''s niece Mary Ann (Frances Grant), who is riding with Flash Baldwin (Donald Kirke), Wolf''s accomplice. Gene notices that Baldwin is wearing his own suit, and decides to pose as Tex Smith, offering to perform at the Lee ranch in place of Gene Autry. After finding his suitcase in Baldwin''s room, Gene overhears Wolf''s scheme to rob the ranch safe, but Baldwin recognizes Gene''s voice by playing his record while he sings.
The next day, while the guests picnic, Wolf and his men crack the ranch safe. Gene pulls a gun on them, but Sheriff Briggs and his posse arrive with Frog and Daniels. He arrests Gene, instead of Wolf, still believing that Gene killed Lee. While the posse locates Mary Ann to implicate Wolf, he deserts his men and Gene overtakes him in his car.

She also meets a charming American stranger, Peter Joshua. On her return to Paris, she finds her apartment stripped bare. A police inspector notifies her that Charles sold off their belongings, then was murdered while trying to leave Paris. The money is missing. Reggie is given her husband''s travel bag, containing a letter addressed to her, a ticket to Venezuela, passports in multiple names and other items. At Charles'' sparsely attended wake, three men show up to view the body. Each of them tests the body to ensure that he is dead.
Reggie is summoned to meet CIA administrator Hamilton Bartholomew at the U.S. Embassy. She learns that the three men at the wake are Tex Panthollow, Herman Scobie and Leopold W. Gideon. In World War II, they, Charles and Carson Dyle went on an OSS operation to deliver $250,000 in gold to the French Resistance, but instead, they stole it for themselves. Dyle was fatally wounded in a German ambush, and Charles double-crossed the others and took all the gold. The three survivors are after the missing money, as is the U.S. government. Bartholomew insists that Reggie has it, even if she does not know where it is.  He tells her she is likely in great danger.
Peter locates Reggie and helps her move into a hotel. The three criminals separately threaten her, each convinced that she knows where the money is. Scobie then shocks Reggie by claiming that Peter is in league with the trio, after which Peter confesses to her that he is really Carson Dyle''s brother, Alexander, intent on bringing the other men to justice because he believes they murdered Carson.
As the hunt for the money continues, first Scobie is found murdered, then Gideon. Then Bartholomew informs Reggie that Carson Dyle had no brother. When she confronts him, Alexander admits he is actually Adam Canfield, a professional thief. Although frustrated by his dishonesty, Reggie still finds herself trusting him.
Reggie and Adam go to the location of Charles''s last appointment and find an outdoor market. When they spot Tex there, Adam follows him. At the sight of stamp-selling booths, Adam and Tex each realize that Charles must have bought several extremely rare and valuable stamps which he affixed to an envelope that has been in plain sight among his possessions. Both men race back to Reggie''s hotel room, only to find that Reggie has given the stamps to Sylvie''s son Jean-Louis for his collection. At the market, Reggie also realizes the envelope''s significance. She learns that Jean-Louis sold the stamps to a trader, who returns the stamps and tells them how much each is worth.
Back at the hotel, Reggie finds Tex''s body with the name "Dyle" scrawled next to it. Convinced that Adam is the murderer, after all, a frightened Reggie telephones Bartholomew, who tells her to meet him at the Colonnade at the Palais-Royal. As she leaves the hotel, Adam spots her and gives chase. At the Colonnade, Reggie is caught out in the open between the two men. Adam tells her that Bartholomew is really Carson Dyle; he survived and became obsessed with exacting revenge on his ex-comrades and reclaiming the treasure. After another chase that ends in an empty theater, Reggie hides in the prompt box. Dyle discovers her and is about to shoot when Adam activates a trapdoor beneath his feet, causing Dyle to fall to his death.
The next day, Reggie and Adam go to the embassy to turn over the stamps, but Adam refuses to go in. Inside, Reggie discovers that Adam is really Brian Cruikshank, the government official responsible for recovering stolen property. His true identity revealed, he proposes marriage.
The movie ends with a split-screen grid showing flashback shots of Brian''s four identities, while Reggie says she hopes that they have lots of boys, so they can name them all after him.','["Stanley Donen"]','["Peter Stone","Peter Stone"]','["Cary Grant","Audrey Hepburn","Walter Matthau"]','["Comedy","Mystery","Romance","Thriller"]','7.9','["tt0046250","tt0047437","tt0050419","tt0060522","tt0048728","tt0054698","tt0062407","tt0062467","tt0053131","tt0050658","tt0058453","tt0032904"]','["Cary Grant"]','[{"url":"/Charade-1963.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/Charade19631280x696_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','Charade19631280x696',97382,'Q496266','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

As the now deceased Mob Boss “Big Morgan” was their greatest leader, Rogers, his lieutenant, decides to bring in Morgan’s son Edward ''Baby Face'' Morgan (Richard Cromwell) to lead the gangsters. Rogers sends two of his loyal but dim-witted henchmen to see whether Edward has the capabilities of his father, and if he does, to bring him back.
Edward, who never knew his father or the life he led, is a small-town delivery boy. The two henchmen misinterpret his account of taking collections and leaving pineapples as proof he uses hand grenades to support his extortion racket and brings him back to Doc. Doc immediately sees that Edward and his cousin Ollie (Chick Chandler) are naive youngsters but decides to use Edward''s name as  a unifying element. However, Doc ensures that the gangsters never meet Edward nor does Edward meet the criminals or know what business they are in. Doc sets Edward and Ollie up as President and Vice President of one of Big Morgan''s shelf corporations called the Acme Protection Agency where the profits of the criminals'' extortion rackets are deposited.  Edward and Ollie believe they are running an insurance company staffed with one of Doc''s henchmen, his moll and an office full of rabbits that the henchman wants to use to make a fur coat for his moll.  The criminals are told that Big Morgan''s brutal son “Baby Face” is running things and they believe Doc''s stories of his cruelty.
Doc believes the Federal authorities are occupied with Japanese-Americans and the German American Bund so they will have a free run. The gangsters begin to extort trucking companies and all pay up, except one led by Virginia (Mary Carlisle) who throws the gangster out of her office. They plan revenge by destroying one of her trucks on its run. When Virginia''s courage makes the newspapers, Ollie decides that their insurance company can sell policies to the victims of "Baby Face Morgan" though Edward does not realise that he is Baby Face.  When Virginia and Edward meet they fall in love. Virginia buys a large policy, the gangsters destroy the truck and Edward pays off the next day. Edward''s prompt payment leads all the other trucking companies to purchase policies from Acme Protection and challenge the gangsters to destroy their old vehicles when they refuse to pay the extortion.
It doesn’t take long before the Mob comes looking for their profits that have been recycled back to the trucking companies. “Baby Face” takes a crash course in acting as a tough guy.','["Arthur Dreifuss"]','["Edward Dein","Jack Rubin"]','["Richard Cromwell","Mary Carlisle","Robert Armstrong"]','["Comedy","Crime","Romance"]','5.2','["tt0046001","tt0030057","tt0039372","tt0037749","tt0031070"]','["Comedy;Crime"]','[{"url":"/babyface_morgan.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/babyface_morgan_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/babyface_morgan_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','babyface_morgan',40310,'Q4838270','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

('tt0000417','free','A Trip to the Moon (1902)','1902','13min','At a meeting of the Astronomy Club, its president, Professor Barbenfouillis, proposes an expedition to the Moon. After addressing some dissent, five other brave astronomers—Nostradamus, Alcofrisbas, Omega, Micromegas, and Parafaragaramus—agree to the plan. They build a space capsule in the shape of a bullet, and a huge cannon to shoot it into space. The astronomers embark and their capsule is fired from the cannon with the help of "marines", most of whom are played by a bevy of young women in sailors'' outfits. The Man in the Moon watches the capsule as it approaches, and it hits him in the eye.Landing safely on the Moon, the astronomers get out of the capsule without the need of space suits and watch the Earth rise in the distance. Exhausted by their journey, they unroll their blankets and sleep. As they sleep, a comet passes, the Big Dipper appears with human faces peering out of each star, old Saturn leans out of a window in his ringed planet, and Phoebe, goddess of the Moon, appears seated in a crescent-moon swing. Phoebe causes a snowfall that awakens the astronomers, and they seek shelter in a cavern where they discover giant mushrooms. One astronomer opens his umbrella; it promptly takes root and turns into a giant mushroom itself.
At this point, a Selenite (an insectoid alien inhabitant of the Moon, named after one of the Greek moon goddesses, Selene) appears, but it is killed easily by an astronomer, as the creatures explode if they are hit with force. More Selenites appear and it becomes increasingly difficult for the astronomers to destroy them as they are surrounded. The Selenites capture the astronomers and take them to the palace of their king. An astronomer lifts the Selenite King off his throne and throws him to the ground, causing him to explode.
The astronomers run back to their capsule while continuing to hit the pursuing Selenites, and five get inside. The sixth astronomer, Barbenfouillis himself, uses a rope to tip the capsule over a ledge on the Moon and into space. A Selenite tries to seize the capsule at the last minute. Astronomer, capsule, and Selenite fall through space and land in an ocean on Earth, where they are rescued by a ship and towed ashore. The final sequence (missing from some prints of the film) depicts a celebratory parade in honour of the travellers'' return, including a display of the captive Selenite and the unveiling of a commemorative statue bearing the motto "Labor omnia vincit".','["Georges Méliès"]',NULL,'["Georges Méliès","Victor André","Bleuette Bernon"]','[""]','8.2','["tt0000439","tt0000012","tt0020530","tt0010323","tt0000211","tt0015648","tt0013442","tt0262883","tt0000014","tt0000010","tt0000091","tt0019760"]','["France;pdmovies","1902","Meilies","sci-fi","b&w"]','[{"url":"/Le_voyage_dans_la_lune_A_trip_to_the_moon__Georges_Mlis_1902_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/Levoyagedanslalune_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','Levoyagedanslalune',193161,'Q244971','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The reward for the person who finds the legendary gentleman burglar is set to $10,000. 
There''s little tough guy Mousey (George Stone), who becomes over zealous over the possibility of winning the reward. Valentine is rumored to have thrown down his hat in a picturesque small town called Fernville in Illinois. Jason and co-worker Cleo Arden (Gloria Dickson) lead the hunt, together with Mousey, and it takes them to the small and previously quiet town. 
The search begins in the small town''s local newspaper, where Jason hopes to find some old files that can reveal Jimmy Valentine''s whereabouts. Jason meets the daughter of the newspaper editor, Bonnie Forbes (Ruth Terry), who takes him to see her father, Tom Forbes (Roman Bohnen). 
It turns out Tom isn''t willing to help out in the search for Valentine. But Bonnie has taken a romantic interest in Jason, and offers to help out. She takes the party to Tom''s gardener, Pinky (Harry Shannon), who she has heard tell stories about Valentine in the past. 
The lead is a dead end, as Pinky claims to know nothing about Valentine of use to Jason. But when Jason and Mousey visits the Forbes'' house, Mousey finds Pinky rummaging about in Tom''s office, destroying old files, and there is a photo of Pinky when he was younger, where his hair color matches the color of Valentine''s side kick back in the day. 
Mousey turns out to be the son of an infamous mobster who was framed by Valentine, and kills Pinky to revenge his father.

He goes about town to collect fingerprints of important persons, and stirs up the whole town, since they are all ex-convicts, having settled down in this peaceful place to live a quiet law-abiding life. 
The fingerprints are stored in a safe at the sheriff''s office, and Jason plans to ambush Valentine and catch him red-handed when he tries to crack the safe open to get hold of the prints. Just as planned, Jason catches Tom, who turns out to be Jimmy Valentine, as he breaks the safe. In an effort to save the rest of the town from being caught, Tom wants to give Jason his prints in exchange for all the others''. 
Mousey enters the scene and tries to get his revenge on Tom/Jimmy. Mousey manages to kill himself, and Jason realizes that Tom/Jimmy wasn''t the one who killed Pinky. Jason tells the police that Pinky was Jimmy Valentine in disguise, thus saving Tom and his daughter from ruin.

Her father is an antiques salesman who loves his stock too much to sell it and therefore doesn''t make any money. Through her friend Molly, Vera manages to get a menial job at Miller''s music instrument factory.
Vera has a habit of going into shops and trying on expensive clothes and jewellery which she could never hope to pay for. On her way home from work she stops in a car dealer and sits in a new luxury car. Robert Miller, the young son of the owner of Miller''s factory, sees Vera and falls instantly in love with her. He pretends to be an employee at the car showroom and they bond together. On a whim, he decides to buy Vera the car and pretends she has won it as the 10,000th customer to visit the shop. Vera''s father is delighted by the new car, but her mother is more suspicious.
Miller wants to spend more time with Vera, but he is uncertain about telling her his true identity in part because he is constantly harassed by women who are interested in his inheritance. He approaches the Hart family and offers to chauffeur the car for them, doing jobs such as weddings to pay for it. As none of them can drive, they accept his offer. Miller gets into the habit of driving Vera to work at the factory, still not revealing the truth that his family owns the business. 
When he discovers how little she is paid, he has her salary raised to five pounds a week. Unfortunately this leads to bad feelings amongst Vera''s colleagues, in particular her superior Henry Butterworth and Anne Fisher who has a crush on Miller, who suspect that Vera is the fancy woman of Miller. Vera is bemused by her pay rise because she is under the impression that she has never met Miller. 
When Vera comes to his office to confront Miller about her increased salary, he hides and gets his friend Peters to pretend to be him. Peters takes a shine to Vera, and tries to persuade her to go out on a date with him. Once she has gone, Miller and Peters get into an argument over whether each of them have a shot with her and whether she is more interested in love or money. The debate is put to the test when Vera, Miller and Peters all head down to a country hotel for an ice-skating carnival. A concerned Mr Butterworth and Miss Fisher also head down to the hotel to keep an eye on Vera, and are shocked when they see her separately with both Peters and Miller, believing that she is two timing them.
Still without revealing his true identity, Miller asks Vera to live with him for ever in a couple of rooms over a garage. She joyfully accepts, but when Butterworth tells her who Miller really is she is hurt - thinking that his offer was not one of marriage but one of a kept woman. She then pretends to be uninterested in Miller and instead focuses her attention on Peters. Eventually however the confusion is resolved and Miller and Vera drive off together in their "car of dreams".',NULL,'["Stafford Dickens","Richard Benson"]','["John Mills","Mark Lester","Norah Howard"]','[""]','5.8','[]','["Grete Mosheim; John Mills; Norah Howard; Robertson Hare; Mark Lester; Margaret Withers; Paul Graetz; Glennis Lorimer; Jack Hobbs; Hay Plumb; Arthur Denton; Mystic Nights Videos"]','[{"url":"/CarOfDreams1935.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/CarOfDreams1935_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/CarOfDreams1935_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','CarOfDreams1935',19764,'Q5037284','wp',NULL,'["Graham Cutts","Austin Melford"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Newspaper reporter Dave Haines is sent to interview Mamie because he already knows her and fancies her. She turns down his invitation to accompany him that evening to the Blue Moon nightclub, but accepts an invitation from "businessman" Jack Conroy to meet there.
Conroy, who is actually a financially strapped playboy, is visited at his home by mild-mannered James Hemingway, who half-heartedly threatens him with a revolver and tells him to stay away from his wife. Conroy denies any involvement with her.
Arriving at the Blue Moon about 9pm, Conroy wines and dines Mamie, while being watched scathingly by Mrs. Hemingway who is seated nearby. It''s obvious that Conroy has in fact had a romantic liaison with her.
The next day at the salon, Mamie signs a deal with theatrical agents Feinberg Goldberg Sternberg & O''Rooney that will give her a career in showbiz, but only if she wins the $150,000 sweepstake. The win is stipulated because it will give Mamie and any productions in which she appears an enormous amount of free publicity.
That evening Mamie learns that she hasn''t won anything at all when the real winner, an older woman also named Mamie Murphy, turns up at her door. The older Murphy offers to keep silent so the showbiz deal will go through.
The horse race is held and Lady Luck wins. Mamie is now making newspaper headlines, and she and "Aunt" Mamie accept the offer from a real estate dealer to move into a plush apartment complete with servants for one month, for his publicity purposes. Mamie and Conroy publicly announce plans to marry.
A maid at the new apartment overhears Mamie telling "Aunt" Mamie the whereabouts of her ticket. Soon after, Mamie and Aunt Mamie are drugged with laced coffee and sleep for hours. They find Conroy''s dead body in the room when they awaken.
Haines, Mamie, Aunt Mamie, Conroy''s valet Briggs, Hemingway and his wife all come under suspicion, but eventually it''s revealed that Blue Moon owner Tony Morelli and his wife Rita had planned to get their hands on the sweepstake ticket from the start and had set up the loan of the apartment with crooked servants for that purpose. Their plan was to get the ticket, pass off Rita as Mamie, and collect a fortune from a banker in exchange for the ticket. Conroy had unexpectedly arrived ahead of the banker, realized a plot was going on, and threatened to reveal the plotters to police so that Mamie''s fortune and his marriage to her wouldn''t be jeopardized. Tony had shot him and implicated Mamie and Aunt Mamie.
The rich Aunt Mamie is attracted to Detective Lieutenant James Riley and they go off to a movie together. Mamie, although left with nothing, realises that may be better than the troubles brought on by fame and fortune, and resumes her feisty friendship with Dave Haines.','["Charles Lamont"]','["John W.

A long ballroom sequence was added, introducing an entirely new character, Count Aristid Karpathy (seen both here and in the musical My Fair Lady, named as Professor Zoltan Karpathy – mentioned in the final scene of the original play, but with no name or onstage appearance), written wholly by Shaw. Against Shaw''s wishes, a happy ending was added, with Eliza fleeing Higgins with Freddy but then returning to Higgins''s home (though whether permanently or on her own terms is left deliberately ambiguous). Shaw and his fellow writers did, however, retain the controversial line "Not bloody likely!" from the play''s text, making Hiller possibly the first person to utter that swear word in a British film and giving rise to adverts for the film reading "Miss Pygmalion?  Not ****** likely!".',NULL,'["George Bernard Shaw","W.P.

This goal crumbles when her parents are forced to undergo sterilization or lose their welfare checks. Alice represents the only real beneficial family member; her aging parents are lazy alcoholics and her siblings have physical and mental disabilities, or criminal ties. But she is told that she too must be sterilized: as their family''s corrupt bloodline must end.
Alice''s parents grudgingly accept the court order, but she flees the house. Unfortunately, the police soon catch her. Her fiancé Jim makes a bold case to Dr. Brooks, who testifies on Alice''s behalf, but it doesn''t change the court''s decision. Meanwhile, another ally of Alice and Jim, Father O''Brien (played by director Crane Wilbur), begs Mrs. Mason to reconsider the sterilization decision. She refuses, desperate to keep receiving welfare, but she becomes so drunk that she reveals that Alice was a foundling the Masons took in, so she actually isn''t of their blood. Father O''Brien races to stop the procedure with the new information. Dr. Brooks is ultimately able to stop the procedure in time.','["Crane Wilbur"]',NULL,'["Diane Sinclair","Donald Douglas","John Preston"]','["Drama"]','6.1','["tt0046187","tt0019381","tt0033890","tt0022913","tt0024188","tt0131354","tt0021730","tt0190403","tt0028478","tt0021814","tt0099700"]','["Fabian Socialists; George W Bush; Patriot Movement; Patriot Act; guru; government; obama; slavery; 2009; creme; new age; congress; FEMA; obligation; senate; white house; barry soetoro; dunham; washington; anne dunham; stanley ann dunham; election; elections; tea party; patriots; tea party patriots; sarah palin; vote; 2008; 2009; 2010; economy; mansour; khalid al-mansour; donald warden; walid; al-walid; prince al-walid.

('tt0023563','free','Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse (1933)','1933','2h 2min','In a noisy print shop, a disgraced police detective named Hofmeister (Karl Meixner) escapes from pursuing criminals'' attacks. Hofmeister telephones his former superior Inspector Karl Lohmann (Otto Wernicke) and explains frantically that he has discovered a huge criminal conspiracy. Before he can disclose the identity of the responsible criminal, the lights go out, shots are fired, and Hofmeister becomes mad. Hofmeister vanishes only to be found later singing every time he feels watched, and he is institutionalized at the asylum run by Professor Baum (Oscar Beregi, Sr.).
Professor Baum introduces the case of Dr. Mabuse (Rudolf Klein-Rogge), the criminal mastermind and hypnotist who ten years earlier went mad. Mabuse spends his days frantically writing detailed plans for crimes while a criminal gang is committing them according to "the plans of the Doctor", with whom they confer only from behind a curtain. When Baum''s colleague Dr. Kramm (Theodor Loos) by chance discovers that recent crimes implement Mabuse''s writings, Kramm is shot by the gang''s execution squad, Hardy (Rudolf Schündler) and Bredow (Oskar Höcker). A clue scratched in a glass window pane at Hofmeister''s crime scene causes Lohmann to suspect Mabuse. On arrival at the asylum, Baum reveals that Mabuse has died. When Lohmann disparagingly talks about "Mabuse the criminal", Baum emphatically speaks about "Mabuse the genius", whose brilliance would have destroyed a corrupt world.
Baum continues to study Mabuse''s writings and communes with the ghost of Dr. Mabuse. The spirit of Mabuse speaks about an "unlimited reign of crime" and merges with the Professor''s silhouette. During the same night, a hidden figure confers with sections of his organisation, preparing various crimes such as an attack on a chemical plant, robbing a bank, counterfeiting, poisoning water and destroying harvests. One of the gang members, Thomas Kent (Gustav Diesel), is conflicted between his criminal work, which he needs to do for money, and his affection for a young woman named Lilli (Wera Liessem). Lilli, devoted to Kent, begs him to confide in her. Kent finally confesses his past and his current situation to her. The two decide to inform the police but are abducted and locked in the strange meeting room with the curtain. The hidden figure announces their death when they discover that the curtained alcove contains only a loudspeaker and that there is a time bomb. After several escape attempts have failed, they flood the place to lessen the impact of the explosion and break free when the time bomb goes off.
Meanwhile, the police are besieging a flat where several gangsters, including Hardy and Bredow, are staying. After a shootout, Hardy commits suicide while the other gangsters surrender. As Bredow testifies that they assassinated Dr. Kramm in the vicinity of the asylum, Lohmann arranges a confrontation between the gangsters and the Professor, which proves inconclusive. On Kent and Lilli''s arrival, Baum''s shocked reaction to Kent makes Lohmann suspicious. Lohmann and Kent visit the asylum, where they discover that Baum is the mastermind and has planned an attack on a chemical plant that night.  Lohmann and Kent go to the exploding plant, where they discover Baum watching from afar. Baum flees to the asylum with Lohmann and Kent pursuing. Mabuse''s spirit leads Baum to Hofmeister in his cell where he introduces himself as Dr. Mabuse, ending Hofmeister''s shock. Baum tries to kill Hofmeister but is stopped by guards, just as Lohmann and Kent arrive. The final scene shows the insane Baum in the cell, tearing Mabuse''s writings to shreds.','["Fritz Lang"]','["Norbert Jacques","Fritz Lang"]','["Rudolf Klein-Rogge","Otto Wernicke","Gustav Diessl"]','["Crime"]','8.0','["tt0013086","tt0024651","tt0054371","tt0015175","tt0015174","tt0019415","tt0027652","tt2306521","tt0012494","tt2254552","tt0019901","tt0011723"]','["mabuse","movie","fritz lang"]','[{"url":"/Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse (1933, Fritz Lang).mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/DasTestamentDesDr.Mabuse1933FritzLang_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','DasTestamentDesDr.Mabuse1933FritzLang',13754,'Q701551','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
('tt0034303','free','Topper Returns (1941)','1941','1h 28min','Wealthy young heiress Ann Carrington (Carole Landis), and her best friend Gail Richards (Joan Blondell) are riding in a speeding taxi driven by Bob (Dennis O''Keefe), along the coast. A figure dressed all in black, with covered face and hat, aims a rifle with the telescopic sight crosshairs focused on the cab from a distance and shoots out the rear tire. The taxi flips over on its side at the very edge of a cliff, inches away from having fallen into crashing ocean waves below.
Bob, the taxi driver, extracts his passengers from the vehicle and leaves them at the side of the road so he can walk back to a garage they passed back down the road to seek help. 
Ann and Gail try hitchhiking and get passed by the first car. Gail raises Ann’s skirt to expose her leg when a second car passes and the driver ends up leaving the road and crashing into a tree. Next they block the road by siting on their suitcases in the middle of the road so the next car is forced to stop. In the sports car is banker Cosmo Topper (Roland Young) and his chauffeur Eddie (Eddie "Rochester" Anderson). The two girls brazenly load their luggage and climb into the car. They insist on being driven to Ann’s destination, the Carrington mansion. The back seat of the car is loaded with luggage and Ann so Gail volunteers to ride sitting on Cosmo''s lap ignoring his protests.
As they drive past Topper''s house, Mrs. Clara Topper (Billie Burke) is out front with her maid and waves to the approaching car. She is surprised to see her husband drive past with a young blonde sitting on his lap, and distraughtly concludes he is having an adventure. The girls are dropped off at the stately cliff top mansion next door to Topper’s residence, where they are received by three creepy staff members, butler Rama (Trevor Bardette), housekeeper Lillian (Rafaela Ottiano), and another unnamed staff member (William H. O’Brien).
Ann is directed to the study to see her father by the housekeeper but her friend Gail is to stay behind. Ann is then intercepted by the creepy Dr. Jeris (George Zucco). Dr. Jeris warns Ann that her father Henry Carrington (H. B. Warner) is in poor health and takes her to meet her father, who is sitting in a chair with a blanket over his legs.  In the conversation we find out that Ann has been raised in the East at her mother’s request. Ann has no memories of her father, as they have been separated since her mother and Carrington’s business partner died in a cave in while inspecting a company mine. Ann’s father also reveals that the next day would be Ann’s twenty-first birthday and, according to her mother’s will, she is to come into full control of the family fortune. 
After leaving her father, Ann and Gail are to be shown upstairs to their rooms. Gail is waiting on the stairs and as Ann crosses the main hall, a giant chandelier breaks loose from the ceiling. Ann escapes harm because Gail screams in time for Ann to stop and just barely be missed by the chandelier. The girls continue on to their rooms. The first room is Gail’s and it is decorated in an Oriental motif. Gail is unimpressed as they have just returned from living in the East. Ann is then taken to her bedroom which is spectacularly decorated. Gail discovers the rooms are adjoining and she makes such a fuss about how beautiful the room is that Ann insists that they trade and Gail sleeps in what was supposed to be Ann’s room.
In the middle of the night, a secret panel opens in the bedroom and the masked hatted figure dressed all in black enters the bedroom and opens the windows. Gail is knifed to death as she gets up to shut the window having been mistaken for Ann.
Gail’s ghost separates from her body. Ghost-Gail walks out the window and goes down the road to the Topper’s house to find someone who can help solve her murder. She finds Topper and convinces him to come to the Carrington mansion by threatening to create a scandal with his suspicious wife if he doesn’t. Topper calls Eddie the chauffeur to get the car ready. Eddie grumbles protests but he does drive Topper back to mansion. Eddie is unaware of the ghost and experiences a number of puzzles as doors open and shut, cushions depress, voices are heard, footprints appear on the snowy walkways, and so on. Eventually he gets so scared that he runs away and drives back to the Toppers and starts packing to leave. Mrs. Topper finds him and asks where Cosmo is, and then demands to be driven to the house next door to find him. Eddie says he’s had it and wants to go back to work for his former employer, Mr. Benny, but Mrs. Topper bullies him into driving her and Emily the maid to the Carrington’s.
Meantime, Topper with the guidance of Ghost-Gail finds the dead body of Gail, and goes downstairs to phone the police but the phone doesn’t work. Dr. Jeris, armed with a pistol, and the three staff discover him, surround him and keep him confined. He insists on going up to the bedroom to show them the body but Gail’s body is gone. The doctor and Mr. Carrington treat him as a lunatic. When Ann comes into the room, Topper tries to explain but the housekeeper finds a note that Gail apparently wrote saying she has left.
At this point Mrs. Topper, her maid Emily (Patsy Kelly), and Eddie arrive and insist Topper is in the house and they push their way in to look for him. By this time it is nearly daylight and Bob the taxi driver shows up at the house to collect his unpaid fare.  Ann, who is wondering what happened to Gail, becomes frightened and asks Bob to stick around and escort her up to her room to get the fare. They go up to the bedroom where Bob volunteers to wait outside the room and while Ann is in the room the black dressed masked assassin appears but Ann sees him in the mirror, screams, and Bob responds in time to see the black figure escape through the window.
In the following sequences, there are lots of comings and goings with people disappearing and reappearing by way of concealed stairways and hallways reachable by moving or rotating wall panels. Mrs. Topper uses the phone and calls the police to report her missing husband and innocently mentions there has also been a murder. Soon police detective Roberts (Donald MacBride) with a squad of cops comes in and starts asking questions. He gets confused by the conflicting answers and by tricks that Ghost-Gail plays from time to time.
The creepy staff and Mr. Carrington confine Topper in the kitchen walk-in refrigerator. Later, when Topper is found by his wife and the bulk of the characters end up in the kitchen Ghost-Gail steals a pistol from the police detective Roberts’ pocket. Ghost-Gail forces it on Topper and manipulates Topper with the gun to get everyone else into the refrigerator and lock them in. Ghost-Gail and Topper then proceed to look for her body to prove the murder. Eventually Bob breaks the window in the door and gets everyone out of the refrigerator. Ann is kidnapped by the figure in black and ultimately rescued by Bob with assistance from Ghost-Gail.
Lillian the housekeeper, is eventually proved to be the writer of Gail’s note. She decides to start talking to say she was in on some of the deceptions but had nothing to do with the murder. The lights go out suddenly and Lillian disappears. It turns out there is a secret chain in the fireplace that, when pulled, makes the chair in the center of the room tilt backwards and dump the occupant down a vertical shaft to a water-filled cave below the mansion.
Eventually, the threads come together, Topper and -Ghost-Gail manage to get her body back from a small ship a short distance offshore from the water cave. The body is returned to the mansion and despite the comic total confusion of the detective, Topper states that the killer must have been the person who was standing nearest the fireplace when Lillian was about to talk, and that person was none other than . . . Mr. Carrington!
Mr. Carrington makes it away and gets in a car and drives off. Ghost-Gail gets into Topper’s sports car, and goes in pursuit. Eddie is in the back seat, terrified at the car that is being driven at top speed on winding roads with an invisible driver. Mr. Carrington, followed in hot pursuit, eventually loses control and his car leaves the road and crashed into a tree. He dies and becomes a ghost himself. Before anyone else arrives, Ghost-Gail browbeats Ghost-Carrington into writing a letter to Ann, confessing that he is not her father, but her father’s business partner. Her father died in the mine together with Ann’s mother, and he has been impersonating Carrington and wanted to kill Ann to keep the fortune for himself.
Ghost-Gail gives the letter to Topper when the rest of the characters arrives at the crash scene, and Topper hands it to Ann. Clara Topper sees that Cosmo was telling mostly truth about his adventures with the two young ladies, and Bob and Ann comfort each other. Eddie quits and Clara convinces the maid Emily to drive the Toppers home.','["Roy Del Ruth"]','["Thorne Smith","Jonathan Latimer"]','["Joan Blondell","Roland Young","Carole Landis"]','["Comedy","Fantasy","Mystery","Romance"]','6.9','["tt0032043","tt0029682","tt0045447","tt0458180","tt0025076","tt0024258","tt0035552","tt0030857","tt0022854","tt0034540","tt0023537","tt0023491"]','["Comedy; Mystery; Murder; Suspense; Fantasy"]','[{"url":"/Topper_Returns_41.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/Topper_Returns_41_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/Topper_Returns_41_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','Topper_Returns_41',93581,'Q1332634','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

In two years, he was working as a writer-producer-director on the Agnes Ayres film, When a Girl Loves.  He is best known for his 1932 horror film White Zombie, starring Madge Bellamy and Bela Lugosi.  Once thought "lost", the film has grown in stature over the years, first gaining a cult status, and eventually becoming recognized as one of the leading classics of the genre.  Years after the film''s release, Victor Halperin expressed a distaste for his horror films: "I don''t believe in fear, violence, and horror, so why traffic in them?"Halperin often worked in collaboration with his brother Edward. The Halperin brothers produced a series of independent low-budget films in the 1930s. Victor Halperin retired in 1942, after working as a director at PRC studios.
Films Halperin directed include When a Girl Loves (1924), Greater than Marriage (1924), The Unknown Lover (1925), Convoy (1927), Party Girl (1930), and Girls'' Town (1942).

Transforming into the personality of Mr. Pryde (again Laurel), he terrorizes the town with unspeakable acts including stealing a boy’s ice cream, cheating at marbles, and popping a bag behind a lady pedestrian. The townspeople track him down where Mr. Pride locks himself in the laboratory and transforms back at Dr. Pyckle. The doctor assures the townspeople that he hasn''t seen the "fiend" they were after. While he talks, the drug used for the transformation spills in the plate of food of the doctor''s dog. Dr. Pyckle confronts the fiendish dog when he locks the door and the townspeople leave. But once again, Mr. Pride emerges and brings havoc to the town, and again is chased down by the townspeople. He enters the lab and transforms back into Pyckle, and again assures the townspeople he hasn''t seen the fiend. His assistant (Julie Leonard) begs the doctor to open and comfort him, but he transforms back into Mr. Pride. He opens the door to the assistant and locks it again. She screams seeing Pride and the townspeople hurry back, before the assistant can knock Pride down.

('tt0001223','free','Frankenstein (1910)','1910','16min','Described as "a liberal adaptation of Mrs. Shelley''s famous story", the plot description in the Edison Kinetogram was:
Frankenstein, a young student, is seen bidding his sweetheart and father goodbye, as he is leaving home to enter a college in order to study the sciences. Shortly after his arrival at college he becomes absorbed in the mysteries of life and death to the extent of forgetting practically everything else. His great ambition is to create a human being, and finally one night his dream is realized. He is convinced that he has found a way to create a most perfect human being that the world has ever seen. We see his experiment commence and the development of it. The formation of the hideous monster from the blazing chemicals of a huge cauldron in Frankenstein''s laboratory is probably the most weird, mystifying and fascinating scene ever shown on a film. To Frankenstein''s horror, instead of creating a marvel of physical beauty and grace, there is unfolded before his eyes and before the audience an awful, ghastly, abhorrent monster. As he realizes what he has done Frankenstein rushes from the room, only to have the misshapen monster peer at him through the curtains of his bed. He falls fainting to the floor, where he is found by his servant, who revives him.

After a few weeks'' illness, he returns home, a broken, weary man, but under the loving care of father and sweetheart he regains his health and strength and begins to take a less morbid view of life. In other words, the story of the film brings out the fact that the creation of the monster was only possible because Frankenstein had allowed his normal mind to be overcome by evil and unnatural thoughts. His marriage is soon to take place. But one evening, while sitting in his library, he chances to glance in the mirror before him and sees the reflection of the monster which has just opened the door of his room. All the terror of the past comes over him and, fearing lest his sweetheart should learn the truth, he bids the monster conceal himself behind the curtain while he hurriedly induces his sweetheart, who then comes in, to stay only a moment. Then follows a strong, dramatic scene. The monster, who is following his creator with the devotion of a dog, is insanely jealous of anyone else. He snatches from Frankenstein''s coat the rose which his sweetheart has given him, and in the struggle throws Frankenstein to the floor, here the monster looks up and for the first time confronts his own reflection in the mirror. Appalled and horrified at his own image he flees in terror from the room. Not being able, however, to live apart from his creator, he again comes to the house on the wedding night and, searching for the cause of his jealousy, goes into the bride''s room. Frankenstein coming into the main room hears a shriek of terror, which is followed a moment after by his bride rushing in and falling in a faint at his feet. The monster then enters and after overpowering Frankenstein''s feeble efforts by a slight exercise of his gigantic strength leaves the house.
Here comes the point which we have endeavored to bring out, namely: That when Frankenstein''s love for his bride shall have attained full strength and freedom from impurity it will have such an effect upon his mind that the monster cannot exist. This theory is clearly demonstrated in the next and closing scene, which has probably never been surpassed in anything shown on the moving picture screen. The monster, broken down by his unsuccessful attempts to be with his creator, enters the room, stands before a large mirror and holds out his arms entreatingly. Gradually, the real monster fades away, leaving only the image in the mirror. A moment later Frankenstein himself enters. As he stands directly before the mirror we are amazed to see the image of the monster reflected instead of Frankenstein''s own. Gradually, however, under the effect of love and his better nature, the monster''s image fades and Frankenstein sees himself in his young manhood in the mirror. His bride joins him, and the film ends with their embrace, Frankenstein''s mind now being relieved of the awful horror and weight it has been laboring under for so long."','["J.

Val McBride is a Confederate guerilla officer, who doesn’t play by the rules. When Roy first rides into town, he encounters an old childhood friend, Dave Allen. Dave tells Roy that he has joined McBride’s guerilla force and Roy is not pleased. He tells Dave that McBride is not a man to be admired but Dave doesn’t listen. 
McBride arrives at the saloon where Dave and Roy are talking and Roy and McBride nearly end up in a fight. The arrival of Union scouts prevents the fight as McBride and his force, including Dave, ride away. Shortly afterwards, McBride is told by his superior Confederate officer that he must play by the rules or be stripped of his command. McBride, furious that his effective (if crude and ungentlemanly) fighting is being scorned, leaves the Confederates and continues to fight both sides on his own.
Roy and Gabby are soon assigned to tracking down and killing McBride and his men. During a brief pause in their search, Roy, Gabby, and the men they have recruited agree to take a small shipment of gold through to another Confederate officer. En route, McBride attacks. Gabby is hurt, though not seriously, while Roy is nearly killed. Dave (still one of McBride’s men) hangs back and helps Gabby get Roy to a nearby cabin for help. Then he leaves to rejoin McBride.

The gang dresses in men''s attire, robs gas stations, and terrorizes habitués of a local lovers'' lane—even raping a young gentleman (off camera) after tying up his girlfriend.
As a newspaperman, Paula''s father has some inside information on police plans to capture the gang, so the girls are able to avoid capture with Mr. Parkins'' unwitting complicity. After a make-out party with a few local gangsters, Paula and her pals agree to wreck a few classrooms — and destroy the American flag — in a public school at the behest of Sheila, a female crime boss. (It is implied that this is part of an anti-American Communist plot.) The girls perform the job with gleeful competence until the police arrive and a deadly shootout takes place, claiming the lives of two of Paula''s gang while Paula shoots and kills a policeman. Seeking refuge from the police, the girls return to Sheila''s to demand their payment for wrecking the school. But Sheila, not wanting to be involved or arrested for their crime, starts to call the police until Paula fatally shoots her. While leading the police on a car chase, Paula crashes the car into a store''s plate-glass window, injuring her and killing her last gang member. Paula is captured and convicted, then dies in the hospital giving birth to the child she accidentally conceived. The judge in Paula''s case denies her parents custody of their granddaughter, based on the neglectful way they raised Paula.

She promises Louise that she will not marry until Louise can look upon her husband to approve him. Lustful aristocrat de Praille (whose carriage kills a child, enraging peasant father, Forget-not) meets the two outside Paris. Taken by the virginal Henriette''s beauty, he has her abducted and brought to his estate where a lavish party is being held, leaving Louise helpless in the big city. An honorable aristocrat, the Chevalier de Vaudrey helps Henriette to escape de Praille and his guests by successfully fighting a duel with him. The scoundrel Mother Frochard, seeing an opportunity to make money, tricks Louise into her underground house to be kept prisoner. Unable to find Louise with the help of the Chevalier, Henriette rents a room, but before leaving her de Vaudrey comforts and kisses the distressed woman. Later, Henriette gives shelter to admirable politician Danton, who after an attack by Royalist spies following a public speech falls for her. As a result, she runs foul of the radical revolutionary Robespierre, a friend of Danton.
Mother Frochard forces Louise into begging. Meanwhile, de Vaudrey proposes to Henriette and she refuses. After expressing love for each other, he promises Henriette that Louise will be found. King Louis XVI orders Henriette to be arrested, due to his disapproval of de Vaudrey''s choice of wife, and the Chevalier is also sent away while his aunt visits Henriette. During the meeting, Louise is heard singing outside, where Frochard has told her to walk blindly and sing. Henriette calls out from her upstairs balcony, but the panicked Louise is dragged off by Frochard and Henriette is arrested and sent to a women''s prison.
Louise and Frochard''s begging continues with the other two Frochards, and before long the Revolution begins. A battle between the Royalist soldiers and the people allied with the police, who are successful, results in aristocrats being killed and the prisoners of the "Tyrants" (including Henriette) being freed. A people''s ''rag-tag'' government is formed, and Forget-not takes his revenge against de Praille.
Robespierre and Forget-not send Henriette and her lover, the Chevalier de Vaudrey, to the guillotine, for hiding de Vaudrey, an aristocrat, who returned to Paris to find her. However, Danton manages to obtain a pardon for them. After a race through the streets of Paris he just manages to save Henriette and offers her to the Chevalier, when the two orphans unite. A doctor restores Louise''s sight, she approves marriage between Henriette and the Chevalier, and a better-organized Republic forms in France.','["D.W.

After an excruciating session, Moe enters his classroom to tell Shemp that his uncle had died and left him an inheritance of $500,000. However, Shemp cannot collect the money unless he is married (which horrifies Shemp) within 48 hours after the reading of the will, leaving him only a few hours. Shemp uses his filled-up black address book to propose to any and all women he has ever known, with unsuccessful results. With time running out, Moe and Larry lead Shemp through a series of disastrous situations including the destruction of a phone booth and Shemp being beaten silly by a woman named Miss Hopkins (Christine McIntyre), who had just moved into the building and mistook Shemp for her cousin Basil. 
Upon recovering from his bruising, Shemp unintentionally proposes to his unattractive and tone-deaf student Miss Dinkelmeyer. She happily accepts and the two of them, with Moe and Larry in tow, head over to the Justice of Peace (Emil Sitka) to get married. Shemp pulls out the wedding ring but accidentally loses it in the piano. Moe forces him to look, and in doing so Shemp wrecks the piano completely. Eventually he finds the ring, and he is hustled to get married right away. However, the Stooges'' landlord calls Moe to tell him that news of Shemp''s inheritance was printed in the newspaper and all of Shemp''s ex-girlfriends that he called and proposed to found out about it and are out looking for him. They all arrive at the Justice of Peace''s office looking to marry Shemp to get his money, whereupon chaos ensues. The women start fighting, taking out their aggressions not only on each other but upon the Stooges as well. Both Moe and Larry are repeatedly kicked in the shins while standing among the crowd of battling women, trying to break them up. In a later scene Moe sets a bear trap in a chair awaiting any of the women who are continually pushing one another into it, but the plan backfires as he tries to antagonize a combatant who grabs him by the hair, spins him around and shoves him backwards into the chair, causing the trap to painfully snap shut on Moe''s rear end. Nonetheless, Shemp, in a dazed state, ends up marrying his student, just in time to collect the money. Shemp comes to, is told what happened, and is frightened beyond reproach. The viewer, however, will see that the student has a heart of gold, unlike the superficially attractive, but hard and shallow gold-diggers, and will likely conclude that Shemp is better off with her.','["Edward Bernds"]','["Clyde Bruckman","Clyde Bruckman"]','["Moe Howard","Larry Fine","Shemp Howard"]','["Comedy","Short"]','7.4','["tt0039828","tt0041623","tt0025688","tt0039444","tt0039399","tt0025889","tt0037911","tt0026878","tt0027097","tt0039142","tt0026479","tt0036860"]','["comedy;short;three stooges"]','[{"url":"/brideless_groom.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/brideless_groom_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/brideless_groom_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','brideless_groom',196373,'Q4966124','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

He is delighted when the Czarina offers to make him a general, but horrified when she tries to seduce him.  He flees and the Czarina puts a price on his head.
Soon afterwards, he receives a letter from his father informing him that the evil nobleman Kyrilla Troekouroff (James A. Marcus) has taken over his lands and is terrorizing the countryside. Hurrying home, Vladimir learns that his father has died.  Vowing to avenge his father and help the victimized peasantry, he adopts a black mask and becomes the Black Eagle, a Robin Hood figure.  Discovering that Kyrilla is Mascha''s father, he takes the place of a tutor who has been sent for from France, but not previously seen by anyone in the household. Vladimir is thus able to become part of Kyrilla''s household.
As Vladimir''s love for Mascha grows, he becomes more and more reluctant to continue seeking revenge against her father, and the two eventually flee the Troekouroff estate.  Vladimir is captured by the Czarina''s men, but the Czarina, once determined to have him executed, has a last-minute change of heart, and she allows Vladimir, given a new French name, and Mascha to leave Russia for Paris.','["Clarence Brown"]','["Alexander Pushkin","George Marion Jr."]','["Rudolph Valentino","Vilma Bánky","Louise Dresser"]','[""]','6.6','["tt0017416","tt1764657","tt0012675","tt0012938","tt0020286","tt0014417","tt0019286","tt0013626","tt0012190","tt0013140","tt0018528","tt0012952"]','["romance;comedy;pdmovies"]','[{"url":"/M4V10006.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/M4V10006_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/the_eagle.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/the_eagle_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/the_eagle_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','the_eagle',15917,'Q3201653','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

('tt0038171','free','Thunderbolt (1947)','1947','44min','Thunderbolt opens with an introduction by James Stewart, who remarks that 1944 has become "ancient history", but reads a message from postwar Army Air Forces commander General Carl Spaatz that, even though the units in the picture happen to be American, the mission depicted could easily have been an RAF mission, and indeed belongs to all people who desire freedom.
Some of the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt  aircraft were modified with cameras: a pair mounted in the cockpit behind the pilot to film both ahead and behind the aircraft, under the wing, in the wheel well of the landing gear, on the instrument panel to film the pilot, or in the guns, synchronized to film when the guns fired.The storyline of Thunderbolt begins by showing desolate areas of Italy in March 1944, noting that this was the fulfillment of the promise of Fascism, an idea dedicated to the proposition that some men are meant to be the slaves of others. The film next brings the audience to Alto Air Base, Corsica, introducing us to members of the 65th Fighter Squadron and explains the objectives of Operation Strangle by way of an after-breakfast briefing that merges into an animated map of Italy showing the Allies stuck at the Gustav line, and the mission to cut off the supply lines by destroying bridges and roads in Northern Italy.The film then follows the pilots led by their young squadron commander through the tense moments before the flight, identifies them by name as they take off in pairs, and observes their journey to the mainland while flying in formation. The pilots are shown finding their target, a bridge, and successfully taking it out; then they go on independent strafing of targets of opportunity, seeking trains, lighthouses, anything that could be used by the enemy and destroying it.
When the pilots return, the film shows how they try to relax in the makeshift American community in Corsica. It also takes a melancholy look into how some of them are getting along emotionally, thinking of what else they could be doing with "the best years of their lives."
Thunderbolt ends with the Allied forcesff liberating Rome on June 4, 1944. The narrators note that it is the "evening" of the mission in Corsica, but not the end of the war. At the end of the film, the words "THE END" appear, to be joined by a red question mark behind it.',NULL,NULL,'["James Stewart","Lloyd Bridges","Eugene Kern"]','[""]','6.7','["tt0036152","tt0036301","tt0034498","tt0036630","tt0036629","tt0037404","tt0185405","tt0139491","tt0035209","tt0038687","tt0274560","tt0036823"]','["WWII; Documentary; Short; William Wyler"]','[{"url":"/THUNDERBOLT_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/thunderbolt_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','thunderbolt',24378,'Q2189358','wp','["Lester Koenig"]','["John Sturges","William Wyler"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Just then, the clock chimes, a puppy in the place of the cuckoo jumps out, then slides down a ramp and licks on one of the orphans. The first orphan to wake shouts to the others, "Merry Christmas, everybody!" They all jump out of bed and make their way to the hall, singing and dancing to the title song where they grab the toys from their stockings, and get ready to play with them.  However, they discover the terrible truth that the toys are old, worn and already broken when they completely fall apart when played with. The children are traumatized and burst into tears over losing them and having no other Christmas presents.
Meanwhile, Professor Grampy is out riding through the snow in his outboard motor-driven sleigh, singing the title song to himself. He soon hears crying as he''s passing the orphanage, so he parks the sleigh, runs to the door and peeps through the window to see the orphans wailing and tearfully heading back to their bedroom. Grampy feels distressed for them and starts to think of a way to give the orphans a better Christmas. He puts on his "thinking cap" and shortly, the lightbulb on the cap blinks, meaning he has an idea. He sneaks in through the kitchen window and starts making new toys out of household appliances, furniture, and other kitchen paraphernalia (a washboard, a roller shade, the works of an old alarm clock, etc.)
While the orphans are still crying in the dormitory, Grampy dresses up as Santa Claus (with bent stovepipes as the boots, a red table cloth as the jacket, a pillow for the weight, a strop as the belt, a picture frame as the buckle and a red purse as the hat), grabs a dinner bell, and surprises the orphans by ringing the bell and shouting, "Merry Christmas, everybody!" The orphans brighten up instantly, stop crying, and all rush out excitedly to play with their new toys.
Grampy completes the scene by making a Christmas tree out of green umbrellas. He places it on top of a phonograph turntable, decorates it, gathers all the orphans together and they all sing the title song one last time. As they sing, a giant 1936 Christmas Seal stamp appears on the screen, showing Santa Claus and a "Holiday Greetings" message.',NULL,NULL,'["Jack Mercer","Mae Questel"]','[""]','7.2','["tt0495079","tt0028110","tt0034556","tt0034515","tt0027453","tt0029856","tt0027722","tt0034699","tt0035014","tt0034466","tt0241399"]','["Fleischer Studios"]','[{"url":"/Christmas_Comes_But_Once_A_Year_1936_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/Christmas_Comes_But_Once_A_Year_1936_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','Christmas_Comes_But_Once_A_Year_1936',104522,'Q5111321','wp',NULL,'["Dave Fleischer","Seymour Kneitel"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

It is the eve of the Chinese Spring Festival. The peasant girl, Xi''er, in the village, Yanggezhuang, Hebei Province, is waiting for her father to return home to celebrate the Spring Festival together. Her girl friends come to bring her paper cuttings with which they decorate the windows. After the girls leave, Xi''er''s fiancé, Wang Dachun, comes to give two catties of wheat flour to Xi''er so that she can make jiaozis. In turn, Xi''er gives a new sickle to Dachun as a gift.
Yang Bailao, Xi''er''s father, has been away to avoid the debt collector from the despotic landlord, Huang Shiren. He returns home at dusk, with no gift other than a red ribbon to tie to the hair of Xi''er for the festivity of the holiday.
The landlord will not let them have a peaceful and happy Spring Festival, and the debt collector comes for the farm land rent which Yang has been unable to pay. They kill Yang Bailao, and take away Xi''er by force as his concubine. Dachun and other villagers come on the scene. Dachun wants to go to the landlord''s residence to fight for justice but is stopped by Zhao Dashu (Uncle Zhao) who, instead, instruct Dachun and other young people to join the Eighth Route Army.
At the home of the landlord, Xi''er is forced to work day and night as a slave and is exhausted. Zhang Ershen (literally Second Aunt Zhang), an elderly maid of the landlord, is very sympathetic of Xi''er. Xi''er dozes off while trying to take a short break. The mother of the landlord comes on the scene and, with her hairpin, pokes Xi''er''s face to wake her up. The landlord mother then orders Xi''er to prepare her a lotus seed soup. When the soup is served, the landlord mother, displeased with the taste, pours the still-boiling soup on Xi''er''s face. Outraged by the pain and anger, Xi''er picks up the whip that the landlord uses to punish her, and beats up the landlord mother. The landlord mother falls and crawls on the floor attempting to flee while Xi''er continues to whip her with her utmost strength. Xi''er gets her vengeance, but she is subsequently locked up by the landlord.
One day, the landlord leaves his overcoat in the living room and in the pocket of the overcoat is the key to Xi''er''s cell. Zhang Ershen is determined to help Xi''er. She takes the key and opens the door for Xi''er, and she flees. Shortly, the landlord finds Xi''er missing, and sends his accomplice, Mu Renzhi, and other men to chase her. Xi''er comes to a river that stops her. She takes off a shoe and leaves it at the river side, and then hides in the bush. Mu Renzhi and his men find the shoe and assume that Xi''er has drowned herself in the river, and they report to the landlord as such.
Xi''er escapes to the mountains, and in the following years, she lives in a cave, gathers offerings for food from a nearby temple. She fights attacking wolves and other beasts. In time, her hair turns white.
On one stormy night, the landlord, Huang Shiren, and several of his other servants come to the temple to worship and provide offerings. Their trip is stopped by the thunderstorm. It just so happens that Xi''er is now in the temple too, and by the light of a flash of lightning, the landlord sees her—with her long white hair and shabby clothes that have been weathered to nearly white. He thinks it is the reincarnation of a goddess who has come to punish him for his mistreatment of Xi''er and other despotisms. He is so frightened that he is literally paralyzed. Xi''er recognizes that it is her arch-enemy and seizes the opportunity to take further revenge. She picks up the brass incense burner and hurls it against the landlord. The landlord and his gang flee.
Meanwhile, her fiancé, Wang Dachun, has joined the Eighth Route Army and fought the Japanese invaders. Now he returns with his army to overthrow the rule of the imperialist Japanese and the landlord. They distribute his farmland to the peasants. Zhang Ershen tells the story of Xi''er, and they decide to look for her in the mountains. Wang Dachun finally finds her in the cave with her hair turned white.

He brings stewardess Shirley Brooks (Jean Parker) with him as a partner.
Jim is in love with Shirley, but has not asked her yet because of all the work in starting the new business. Shirley mistakes this for a lack of interest. Tired of waiting, she becomes engaged to another pilot, Bob Fuller (Dick Purcell). Jim is upset and arranges for Bob to go to Hackensack, New Jersey, for a phoney job just to get him out of the way and prevent Shirley from marrying him.
Next, Jim and Shirley fly to Las Vegas with two newlywed couples: Veronica (Marie Wilson) and Chester Gimble (Grady Sutton), and Danila (Kay Sutton) and Eric Karolek (Nils Asther) (in reality, a spy named Colonel Boro). Joining them is their mechanic, Riley (Eddie Quillan), who is expecting to become a father any day. Jim is unaware that the Karolek couple are spies who work for Rocky Drake (Roger Pryor), attempting to steal a transformer used for a top-secret XB-62 bomber prototype. While the others are off celebrating, Drake meets his contact, gets the transformer and kills the man delivering it.
Drake sneaks aboard Jim''s aircraft, flying back to Los Angeles. When Jim discovers the freeloader, he tries to turn the aircraft back to turn him into the police, but Drake forces him to continue. They fight over control of the aircraft. Shirley, not realizing it is for real, gives Drake''s gun to Eric Karolek, who forces Jim to fly towards Mexico. On the way, the aircraft passes through a storm and starts shaking violently, causing an Allison V-12 engine block Drake brought aboard, to break loose, smashing instruments and engine controls inside the cockpit. Even with his engines shut down, Jim manages to land in the mountains.
While Jim and Drake try to repair the aircraft, Chester Gimble tries to call for help and fires off a signal flare, that lands in a nearby bush and sets it on fire. The fire comes closer and threatens them all, but soon the aircraft is ready to fly. Drake and the Karoleks try to commandeer the flight and a struggle ensues. In the end, Riley shoots and kills Drake. They all board the aircraft and Jim is able to take off.
Jim flies back to Las Vegas just in time to get the transformer back in place in the bomber before its test flight. Jim is the hero of the day, and he and Shirley go back to Los Angeles.

As a result, he is sidelined for the rest of World War I.
In 1925 New Orleans, lawyer Henry Sykes (Clarence Wilson) hires now civilian Captain Winters for a salvage job on behalf of Evelyn Inchcape (Laura La Plante). Sykes insists on using his own deep sea diver to retrieve something from none other than the Alatania. After a box is brought up, Winters confronts the diver, who turns out to be Karl Ludwig, the commander of the submarine for whom Winters has been searching. He puts Ludwig in the brig, though he soon escapes.
Then Winters goes to see Sykes and Inchcape. Inchcape''s wealthy uncle and cousin lost their lives aboard the Alatania. Winters reports he has recovered two wills, one leaving a million dollar estate to Inchcape, the other to the cousin, whom Sykes implies is still alive. Now, after seven years, the uncle can be declared legally dead. Winters is willing to split the money with either party. Despite his professed indifference to Inchcape''s beauty and her loathing of men in general, when they are alone, he gives her the first option. She despises him, but he tears the will in her favor in two and gives her half. Later, he sees Sykes at his office and, while pretending to bargain, learns that the cousin is actually dead; Sykes intended to produce an imposter.
Sykes bribes Winters'' first mate and some men to betray him. When Winters goes to settle accounts with Ludwig, he is ambushed and knocked out (though Ludwig has no part in it). Sykes kidnaps Inchcape and sets sail on Winters'' ship. In a cabin, Sykes attempts to force himself on Inchcape, but she is rescued by Ludwig. They have a talk. Meanwhile, Winters, accompanied by his friend, ineffectual upper class lawyer Percy Atwater (Claud Allister), boards the ship and subdues the crew.
Then he gets his long-awaited bout with Ludwig. Just as Winters is about to choke the life out of his hated foe, Inchcape shows him a letter in which Ludwig''s sweetheart informs him that she will be sailing on the Alatania. Ludwig received it after the sinking. Winters acknowledges that Ludwig has suffered enough and lets him go.
Afterward, Winters forces Sykes to marry him and Inchcape, before having the lawyer tossed overboard.','["William Nigh"]','["Burnet Hershey","William Nigh"]','["Alan Hale","Laura La Plante","Clarence Wilson"]','[""]','5.7','["tt0021377","tt0021910","tt0013442","tt0024258","tt0044658","tt0022021","tt0022432","tt0020806","tt0030253","tt0022243","tt0024008","tt0040695"]','["Drama; War"]','[{"url":"/U-67-TheSeaGhost_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/U67.mp4","format":"h.264"}]','U-67-TheSeaGhost',20553,'Q7762756','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

A title describes the situation as "misery and want, the family''s lot." Helen Rogers (Leonard), his wife, cries with their daughter over their poverty. Arthur leaves to go to the tavern. He asks the bartender (Sennett) to put an alcoholic drink on his tab, which he refuses. Two patrons buy drinks for Arthur and invite him to their table. He becomes intoxicated and returns home to a frightened wife and daughter (Egan). Arthur is described as "helpless, the father leaves the house of sorrow." He writes a letter: "Dear Helen, you will be better off without me. I leave for good. May God help you. Arthur." He slides the letter through the door before he departed. Helen picks up the letter to read his words. Arthur returns to the bar, where he drinks to the point of unconsciousness. The bartender literally picks him up and throws him outside.  Helen and her daughter leave the house to go to an employment agency, but are turned away. They return to the house to find the son (Tansey) ate their only food: a small loaf of bread. His arm is also in an unexplained sling. 
An attorney stops at Helen''s house to tell her of litigations that have cleared, and she is now the beneficiary of her late aunt''s estate. She and the children are overjoyed. Helen is seen wearing a luxurious hat, as the attorneys direct her to her new home. It is furnished with lavish embellishments, but its only flaw is that it is without a chimney. On Christmas Eve, Helen tells the children that Santa Claus will come through the window. She drags the children to bed. They pray, and she kisses them before tucks them into bed. The children sneak out of bed to set a trap by the window. The purpose of the trap is unclear, but a logical conclusion is to make Santa trip and fall, causing a commotion, and thus witness him to prove his existence. Helen bought a Santa costume and happily considers to dress up to fool her children to believe that Santa is real. She quickly is saddened to realize that the costume should be worn by a male, namely her husband. She is unaware that her husband now makes his living as a burglar. He sees the mansion and trespasses through the window, unknowingly that it now belongs to his wife. Arthur is caught in the trap. Helen catches her husband''s attempted burglary against her and their children. She is shocked, and he is ashamed. Arthur begs for her to take him back, and she agrees after a long consideration.

His friend Zhao (Zhao Dan) stops him, and leads him back to their rented apartment.  We learn that the four graduate friends are all jobless. Zhao serenades to Xu and dissuades him from thoughts of suicide, asking him to concentrate on his freelance translation job instead.  Xu tells Zhao he has decided to sell his degree in order to raise funds to see his mother in the countryside.  His other friend Tang comes to celebrate his own birthday with a fourth friend, Liu.
A female college graduate Yang (Bai Yang) comes to Shanghai to look for a job, and rents the room beside Zhao''s.  Meanwhile, Zhao finds a job at the press.  Jubilant, he washes his laundry and hangs them up on a pole that extends into his neighbour''s room.  Yang is napping, and the wet laundry drips her pillow damp.  Yang''s friend comes in and bangs a few nails for her to hang her clothes, and Zhao''s framed photos fall off at the opposite side of the wall. 
Zhao comes home from work in the morning, while Yang goes to work as a trainer at a textile factory.  Zhao leaves a bag in the tram he is alighting, but fortunately Yang helps retrieve it for him through the window.  When Zhao gets home, he sees his scattered photos on the floor back in his apartment, and retaliates by hitting the nails through to the other side and flinging rubbish to the other room.  The girls hit back in the night, when he is not around, and write him a note of warning.  Hence begins a lighthearted feud that swings to and fro between the two parties.
Zhao meets Yang again in the tram and helps her retrieve something she dropped outside the window.  He goes to her textile company to find materials to write his journalistic report, and helps fight a hooligan who is harassing Yang.  The two arrange to meet at a park nearby a couple of days later for his interview.  By then, Yang has already realized he is the tenant next door.  After the interview, Zhao does a series of write-ups entitled "the sad life-story of a female worker".  
One day, Yang finally knocks on Zhao''s door and reveals to him who she really is.  She tells him she is only disclosing this secret because she is leaving Shanghai – the factory she works in has recently closed down.  Zhao stops her and tells her that he will support her in Shanghai.  However, after he goes to work, Yang goes through a dilemma, and finally decides to leave so as not to be a financial burden on him.  When Yang''s friend realize they are pining for each other, she decide to bring the couple together again.
By then, Zhao has received news that he, too, has been dismissed from his job.  He and Tang walk towards the pier, where they meet Yang and her friend, who are also out of work.  They read from the newspaper that their friend Xu has committed suicide because he is unemployed.  Zhao and Tang conclude that Xu is too weak, and that they must be optimistic like their other friend Liu, in facing their paths in life.

Rothschild however uses the money for his own ends, with the help of his sons, Nathan Rothschild in London and James Rothschild in Paris. They first use the money to finance Wellington''s army in Spain''s war against Napoleon, at advantageous terms of interest. In a notable coup, in 1815, Nathan spreads the rumour that Napoleon had won the Battle of Waterloo, causing London stock prices to collapse. He then bought a large quantity of equities at the bottom of the market, profiting handsomely as prices rose once the truth about the battle emerged. In a decade, the Rothschilds have accumulated a fortune of £11 million by using the Elector''s money. 
Nathan returns the original capital to the Elector, plus only a small amount of interest, keeping the great bulk of the profits for the Rothschilds, and plans to formalise a Europe wide network of family led financial institutions.

('tt0024962','free','The Rise of Catherine the Great (1934)','1934','1h 35min','This historical drama recounts the events that led to the accession of Catherine the Great, Empress of all the Russias. The film opens with the arrival in 1744 of Princess Sophie Auguste Frederika – whose name would be changed to ‘Catherine’ – from her father’s court of Anhalt-Zerbst (in modern Germany) to the court of the Empress Elizabeth.  "Little Catherine" is to marry the Grand Duke Peter, nephew and heir presumptive of the unmarried and childless Empress Elizabeth.
Peter already displays signs of mental instability and a sharply misogynist streak.  He rejects Catherine on their wedding night, reacting to something innocently said by his French valet, claiming that she used feminine tricks to win him over. In time, though, Peter accepts her and they have a happy marriage for a while.  Meanwhile, Catherine gains important experience of government from working as principal aide to the empress.
The empress dies and Peter becomes tsar, but his mental illness is starting to get the better of him, along with sheer boredom in the job.  Catherine still loves him despite beginning a very public love affair with one of her best friends – until one night when Peter goes one step too far in publicly humiliating his wife.  She ceases to love him, which enables her to be clear-headed in supporting a planned coup d''état.  The following morning, he is arrested and Catherine is made Empress of All the Russias.
The elevation is marred by Peter''s murder that very morning, contrary to Catherine’s command. Grigory Orlov explains that everything has a price, and the crown has the highest price of all. The film ends, with Catherine in tears on her throne, while the cheers of the crowds are heard outside.',NULL,'["Lajos Biró","Arthur Wimperis"]','["Douglas Fairbanks Jr.","Elisabeth Bergner","Flora Robson"]','["Biography","Drama"]','6.4','["tt0028167","tt0024473","tt0025746","tt0025681","tt0034399","tt0043153","tt0028282","tt0022335","tt0077309","tt0015361","tt0066579","tt0023293"]','["Biography; Drama; Douglas Fairbanks Jr."]','[{"url":"/The_Rise_of_Catherine_the_Great.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/The_Rise_of_Catherine_the_Great_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/The_Rise_of_Catherine_the_Great_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','The_Rise_of_Catherine_the_Great',20727,'Q1736026','wp',NULL,'["Paul Czinner","Alexander Korda"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

He is in love with the Princess Nadji of Egypt, who has lately escaped to America and is now staying with the Chandler family at their home in Beverly Hills, California.  Princess Nadji believes she has left her troubles behind in Egypt, but when the Chandlers hold a party in her honor, she learns that her life is still in jeopardy, as are the lives of her friends.  Chandu, presently arriving home from Egypt himself, is pursued by enemies at the airport, and escapes only by using his magic ring.  At the party, some shady guests conspire to poison Princess Nadji, and Chandu arrives just in time to snatch the glass of deadly wine out of her hand.
Chandu explains to Nadji what has happened, and why she is in danger.  A cult of Black Magic sorcerers, the Sect of Ubasti, have recently recovered the perfectly preserved body of their last high priestess, Ossana.  Legend tells that Ossana will one day be resurrected and will rule the "lost continent" of Lemuria again; however, in order to resurrect her, the Ubasti must make a human sacrifice, and the sacrifice must be an Egyptian princess of royal blood.  "Princess Nadji is the only living Egyptian princess," says Chandu, "and the Ubasti will stop at nothing."  The cult are determined to capture Nadji and sacrifice her to their god.
The twelve chapters of The Return of Chandu follow Chandu and his family (his sister, his nephew, and his niece) on various adventures while they struggle, by both magical and not-so-magical means, to rescue and protect Princess Nadji from the Sect of Ubasti.  Their journey brings them finally to the land of Lemuria itself, where Chandu must decide whether he can renounce his love for Nadji in order to save her life.','["Ray Taylor"]','["Barry Barringer","Harry A.

Eventually their village itself is occupied by the Nazis. Meanwhile, men and women take to the hills to form partisan militias.
The full brutality of the Nazis is revealed when a German doctor (Erich von Stroheim) uses the village children as a source of blood for transfusions into wounded German soldiers.

They launch a cavalry assault on the village to rescue the children. The Russian doctor accuses the German doctor of being worse than the convinced Nazis, because he has used his skills to support them. He then shoots him.

('tt0057012','free','Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964)','1964','1h 35min','United States Air Force Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper is commander of Burpelson Air Force Base, which houses the Strategic Air Command (SAC) 843rd Bomb Wing, flying B-52 bombers armed with hydrogen bombs. The 843rd Wing is flying on airborne alert, two hours from their targets inside the USSR.

General Ripper orders his executive officer, Group Captain Lionel Mandrake of the UK Royal Air Force, to put the base on alert. Ripper also issues "Wing Attack Plan R" to the patrolling aircraft, one of which is commanded by Major T. J. "King" Kong. All of the aircraft commence an attack flight on the USSR and set their radios to allow communications only through their CRM 114 discriminators, which was designed to accept only communications preceded by a secret three-letter code known only to General Ripper. Mandrake discovers that no war order has been issued by the Pentagon and he tries to stop Ripper, who locks them both in his office. Ripper tells Mandrake that he believes the Soviets have been using fluoridation of the American water supplies to pollute the "precious bodily fluids" of Americans. Mandrake realizes that Ripper has gone insane.
In the War Room at the Pentagon, General Buck Turgidson briefs President Merkin Muffley and other officers about how Plan R enables a senior officer to launch a strike against the Soviets if all superiors have been killed in a first strike on the United States. Turgidson reports that his men are trying every possible three-letter CRM code to issue the stand-down order, but that could take over two days and the planes are due to reach their targets in a couple of hours. Muffley orders the U.S. Army to storm the base and arrest General Ripper. Turgidson then attempts to convince Muffley to let the attack continue, but Muffley refuses to be party to a nuclear first strike. Instead, he brings Soviet ambassador Alexei de Sadeski into the War Room to telephone Soviet Premier Dimitri Kissov on the "hot line". Muffley warns the Premier of the impending attack and offers to reveal the positions of the bombers and targets so that the Soviets can protect themselves.
After a heated discussion in Russian with the Premier, the ambassador informs President Muffley that the Soviet Union has created a doomsday machine, which consists of many buried bombs jacketed with "cobalt-thorium G" connected to a computer network set to detonate them automatically should any nuclear attack strike the country. Within two months after detonation, the cobalt-thorium G would encircle the planet in a radioactive "doomsday shroud", wiping out all human and animal life, rendering the surface of the Earth uninhabitable for about 93 years. The device cannot be dismantled or "untriggered", as it is programmed to explode if any such attempt is made. When the President''s wheelchair-bound scientific advisor, the former Nazi German Dr. Strangelove, points out that such a doomsday machine would only be an effective deterrent if everyone knew about it, de Sadeski replies that the Soviet Premier had planned to reveal its existence to the world the following week.
Meanwhile, U.S. Army troops arrive at Burpelson, still sealed by Ripper''s order, to take over the base after a heated firefight with Air Force security policemen. General Ripper then shoots and kills himself, while Mandrake identifies Ripper''s CRM code from his desk blotter ("OPE," a variant of both Peace on Earth and Purity of Essence) and relays this code to the Pentagon. Using the recall code, SAC successfully recalls all of the bombers but one. No one in the War Room knows that a Soviet surface-to-air missile has damaged the fuel tanks of that plane and destroyed its radio equipment, making it impossible to recall this particular plane even with the correct recall code.

Muffley discloses the plane''s target to help the Soviets find it, but its commanding officer, Major Kong, with his fuel dwindling, has selected a nearer target instead. As the plane approaches the new target, the crew is unable to open the damaged bomb bay doors. Kong enters the bomb bay and repairs the broken electrical wiring, whereupon the doors open and the H-bomb is dropped. With Kong straddling it, the bomb falls and detonates over a Soviet ICBM site.
Back in the War Room, Dr. Strangelove recommends that the President gather several hundred thousand people to live in deep underground mines where the radiation will not penetrate. He suggests a 10:1 female-to-male ratio for a breeding program to repopulate the Earth once the radiation has subsided. Turgidson, worried that the Soviets will do the same, warns about a "mineshaft gap". Dr. Strangelove declares he has a plan, but then rises from his wheelchair and announces that he can walk again. Soon, the Doomsday Machine kicks into operation, and the film ends with a montage of many nuclear explosions, accompanied by Vera Lynn''s version of the popular World War II song "We''ll Meet Again".','["Stanley Kubrick"]','["Stanley Kubrick","Terry Southern"]','["Peter Sellers","George C.

It moves quickly to point out it''s the "same old story" of war and hunger under the Provisional Government, however. The buildup to the October Revolution is dramatized with intertitles marking the dates of events.
April 1917 Vladimir Lenin returns to Petrograd''s Finland railway station packed with supporters.
July 1917 The demonstrations in Nevsky Square are fired upon by the army. The government orders the working class to be cut off from the city center, and in a dramatic sequence the bridges are raised with the bodies of the Bolsheviks still on them as the Bourgeoisie throw copies of the Bolshevik newspaper into the river.
The Bolshevik headquarters also is destroyed by the ruling class, and the Provisional Government orders the arrest of Lenin, who has gone underground but continues to direct the plans for the uprising. Provisional Government leader Alexander Kerensky is mockingly characterized and compared to a mechanical peacock and Napoleon, before satirically being accused of aspiring to the Russian throne.
General Kornilov advances his troops on Petrograd "for God and country." While the government is helpless the Bolsheviks rally to the defense. The Bolsheviks take control of the city''s arsenal and General Kornilov is arrested. Leaflets spread the messages of the revolution, and workers are trained to use weapons for the "last and decisive battle."
October 1917 The Bolshevik Committee votes to approve Lenin''s proposal to revolt.
October 24 Lenin returns to the Smolny after four months in hiding and takes control of the uprising on the eve of the 25th. A message is sent to the people declaring the Provisional Government is deposed as of October 25 at 10 AM.
October 25 The cruiser Aurora sails in as the workers take control of the bridges. The Minister of War calls troops to the aid of the deposed government, and Cossacks and the Women''s Death Battalion arrive at the Winter Palace and lounge on the Tsar''s billiard table. The Provisional Government drafts an appeal to the citizens attempting to reassert its legitimacy, but that evening a congress is held including delegates from all parts of the country and the Soviets are voted into power.
With the weapons and preparations by the Military Revolutionary Committee, Bolsheviks march immediately on the Winter Palace and demand its surrender. The Provisional Government, seemingly aloof, gives no reply. The Women''s Death Battalion surrenders and kills their superiors. A group of Soviets infiltrate the vast palace through the cellars and locate the government forces inside. The Cossacks surrender and join the Soviets. At the congress, the Mensheviks appeal for a bloodless end to the conflict, depicted as "harping", falls on deaf ears.
The signal is given by a shot from the Aurora and the assault begins in earnest. In an epic climactic sequence, Soviets storm the palace en masse and overwhelm the defending forces. Soldiers in the palace raid the palace for valuables, only to have their pockets turned out by the Soviets once they have surrendered. Finally, the Soviets beat down the door to the Provisional Government''s chambers and arrest the government members. Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko drafts a formal statement declaring the Provisional Government deposed. Clocks around the world are shown marking the time of the revolution''s success as the Soviets cheer.

After his accomplices Ryan and Taylor have broken in and stolen furs from the Flawless Furs warehouse, Steve kills the guard with his hook. When the police arrive at the crime scene in the shape of Detective Dick Tracy, he talks to Humphries, who is the owner of the store; Peter Premium, who is a representative for the insurance company; and a man named Cudd, who is the insurance investigator. The insurance company only has twenty-four hours to find the stolen goods, or they have to reimburse the fur company. Tracy and his semi-competent assistant Patton examine the dead body at the morgue and find a note on it stating that there were three perpetrators performing the hit against the warehouse. It also mentions that they used a truck with the name "Daisy" on it. Unfortunately, the three perpetrators disguise the truck before Tracy can find it, and the lead is a dead end. The robbers soon leave their hideout in a local junkyard and go to a nearby bar to phone their boss and get new instructions. As they speak with the boss on the phone, their conversation is overheard by an informant, a blind beggar called Sightless, who goes to pass the information on. Sightless is sloppy and noisy when eavesdropping, and is nearly caught by The Claw. Still, he manages to escape the bar.
Sightless goes directly to Dick Tracy, but is stopped at the door by Tracy''s friend, Vitamin Flintheart. Vitamin believes the beggar is up to no good, and denies him entrance to the house. After listening to Sightless'' message, Vitamin gets rid of him. Still, he passes the message on to Tracy later, and Tracy and Patton manage to find the fence that the three robbers were meeting, Longshot Lillie. Lillie is taken into custody and questioned, but is unable to identify the robbers. At the same time The Claw finds Sightless'' apartment and kills the blind man with his hook. Soon after Tracy and Patton arrives, and The Claw flees the scene. Patton pursues the killer, fires a shot and wounds him, but still, The Claw manages to escape.
Tracy notices that The Claw had tried to make a phone call from Sightless'' phone, and can identify the first digits from hook scratches on the phone dial. He sends Patton to find the rest of the phone number. Tracy himself goes to the insurance company and accuses them of stealing the furs from the warehouse. They protest against the charges when Patton arrives and tells them that the number leads to the store owner Humphries. Humphries'' plan was all along to sell back the furs to the insurance company after the twenty-four hours had passed and collect the penalty fee stated in the policy. He calls the robbers at the same bar as before, instructing them to tell the insurance company to come to the bar with $50,000. Feeling guilty about sending Sightless off to a certain death before, Vitamin goes to the bar to find the killer, pretending to be a blind beggar himself. Sam and Fred make an attempt to steal the money for themselves, but The Claw, wounded but still capable of fighting, manages to kill them both. The killings are witnessed by Vitamin, who also hears The Claw talk on the phone to Humphries, telling him the furs'' whereabouts.
Meanwhile, Patton and Cudd have gone to Humphries and are watching him as he talks to The Claw. Humphries tells The Claw over the phone about his predicament, and The Claw becomes suspicious towards Vitamin and his blind beggar performance. Tracy arrives to the bar just in time to save his friend from The Claw, and there is a chase back down to the junkyard. Tracy chases The Claw to a high-voltage generator, and the killer is killed by an electric shock when he touches a wire with his hook.','["John Rawlins"]','["Robert Stephen Brode","Chester Gould"]','["Ralph Byrd","Lyle Latell","Kay Christopher"]','["Action","Crime","Drama"]','6.0','["tt0038478","tt0037642","tt0039320","tt0028785","tt0030059","tt0033535","tt0031230","tt0039324","tt0042100","tt0038259","tt0065615","tt0038346"]','["Dick Tracy;Crime;Detective"]','[{"url":"/dick_tracys_dilemma.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/dick_tracys_dilemma_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/dick_tracys_dilemma_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','dick_tracys_dilemma',60927,'Q5273471','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Twenty years later in present day 1970, lawyer John Carter arrives in East Willard on Christmas Eve with his assistant and mistress Ingrid, having been charged by Jeffrey Butler to sell the house. Carter meets with the town''s leading citizens: Mayor Adams; Sheriff Bill Mason; the taciturn Charlie Towman, who owns the local newspaper; and Tess Howard, who operates the town''s telephone switchboard. They all agree to buy the Butler mansion on behalf of the town for the bargain price of $50,000, which Jeffrey Butler requires to be paid in cash the next day. Carter and Ingrid stay the night at the Butler mansion, unaware that they are being watched by an unseen man who has just escaped from a local mental hospital and just arrived in East Willard in a stolen car. After dinner, Carter and Ingrid retreat to a bedroom to have sex. Their unknown stalker enters the bedroom and brutally murders them both with an ax, and then reads from a Bible before placing a crucifix in Ingrid''s hand. The killer calls the sheriff, asking him to come investigate Carter''s disappearance, and introduces himself as the house''s owner. While talking with Tess, who forwards his call, he calls himself "Marianne".
At nightfall, Jeffrey Butler arrives at the mansion to meet with Carter, but finds it locked and empty. He drives to the mayor''s home, where he meets Diane, the mayor''s daughter. The mayor has gone to the county''s bank to obtain the required cash for the payment, so she redirects Jeffrey to the sheriff''s office. At the same time, the sheriff is heading to the mansion, but stops at Wilfred Butler''s disturbed gravesite, where he finds Butler''s diary, then he''s attacked and killed with a shovel.
Failing to find the sheriff, Jeffrey goes back to the mayor''s house, where Diane tells him she''s received some calls for her father by a certain "Marianne", who said to be waiting at the mansion. Puzzled by the strange events, Jeffrey and Diane decide to drive to the mansion, but stop after they find the sheriff''s abandoned car. They instead go find Towman at the newspaper. Towman, who can''t speak due to laryngectomy, manages to explain that Tess also drove to the mansion. Jeffrey and Towman go after her while Diane does more research in the archives. After a call from "Marianne" tells her to look up the events of Christmas 1935, she pieces together Wilfred''s story. In 1930, his wife died of tuberculosis. In 1933, his daughter Marianne, who was 15 at the time, was raped and got pregnant; the son she gives birth to is Jeffrey, whom was sent away to California. In 1935, Wilfred turned the mansion into a mental hospital and had Marianne committed. The rest of the story has apparently been redacted.
At the mansion, the still-unseen killer "Marianne" greets a visibly frightened Tess, then repeatedly bashes her over the head with a candlestick. After an unfruitful trip to Tess''s house, Jeffrey goes back to Diane, who fills him in about her discoveries, particularly the fact that his mother didn''t die giving birth like Jeffrey thought. They head to the mansion. On their way there, they pass Towman''s car, which has been set on fire. Further down the road, Towman throws himself at Jeffrey''s car and Jeffrey runs him over, killing him. Examining the body, he realizes somebody cut his hands off. At the mansion, Jeffrey finds his grandfather''s diary, where it''s revealed he was the one who got Marianne pregnant. The diary recounts how Wilfred grew hostile toward the complacent hospital staff, so on Christmas Eve in 1935, he freed the hospital''s patients, causing a massacre that resulted in Marianne''s death as well. He then ended up faking his death in 1950 and he''s been living anonymously in a nearby mental hospital ever since before escaping.
Jeffrey tells Diane that his grandfather/father is still alive, and that the sheriff, Tess, Towman and the mayor were all former inmates Wilfred sought revenge on for the death of Marianne. The mayor arrives at the mansion armed with a rifle, and he and Jeffrey open fire, killing each other. The killer, revealed to be the elderly Wilfred Butler, finally appears, and Diane grabs Jeffrey''s gun and shoots him dead. A year later, Diane takes one last look at the Butler mansion before it is destroyed by a bulldozer crew.','["Theodore Gershuny"]','["Theodore Gershuny","Jeffrey Konvitz"]','["Patrick O''Neal","James Patterson","Mary Woronov"]','["Horror","Mystery","Thriller"]','5.6','["tt1686897","tt1656197","tt1016090","tt0081793","tt3831344","tt2521436","tt5780484","tt3758564","tt8080648","tt4066958","tt3665498","tt3397948"]','["horror;slasher;suspense;thriller;mystery"]','[{"url":"/SilentNightBloodyNight.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/SilentNightBloodyNight_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/SilentNightBloodyNight_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/Silent_Night_Bloody_Night.mp4","format":"h.264"}]','SilentNightBloodyNight',89509,'Q7514613','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The title character had a catchphrase; upon apprehending a criminal, Love would declare, "You''re under arrest, Sugah!"  
The film proved a success, and consequently spawned a short-lived television series on the ABC network. 22 episodes were shown from September 11, 1974-April 5, 1975, featuring Charles Cioffi as Love''s supervisor Lt. Matt Reardon, who was later replaced by Jack Kelly as Capt. Arthur Ryan.  
Financed on a meager budget and heavily sanitized to conform to Graves'' religious morals (she had become a Jehovah''s Witness since the making of the pilot, and eventually retired from the entertainment industry to focus on her faith), the series was cancelled after one year. One episode featured many of Graves'' former Laugh-In co-stars such as Judy Carne, Jo Anne Worley, and Arte Johnson in particular playing a mad bomber.

All eight have now developed an immunity to Ro-Man''s death ray, having received an experimental antibiotic serum developed by the scientist.
Ro-Man must complete the destruction of all humans, even if it means his physically killing them one by one, before his mission to subjugate the Earth is complete. After fruitless negotiations, Ro-Man destroys the spaceship headed for the orbiting platform, killing the two pilots aboard.

He refuses to eliminate her, forcing the alien leader, the Great Guidance, to teleport to Earth after first killing the disobedient Ro-Man. The Great Guidance then attempts to finish the genocide by releasing prehistoric dinosaurs and a massive earthquake on the remaining survivors.

The film opens with the execution of a British spy who was sent to support partisan activities. A small team is assembled which consists of Capt. Robert Owen, a Canadian, Sgt. Harry Hall, a Briton and a Norwegian called Lt. Erik Falken. The team parachutes in and soon after arriving Falken is recognised by a local woman who reports them to her German lover and Dalberg, a Quisling. A team is sent to capture them but after they overpower their captors and free the general from the prison camp they are soon being pursued by the German authorities.
Once on the road in a captured German car they are attacked and forced to take shelter after Heden is hurt.

The Germans take Falken alive and, pretending to be the doctor they requested, capture Owen near the house they are hiding in. Hall manages to keep Heden in safety in the house.
Owen misleads the Germans about their escape plans and after the Germans have realised their mistake they are surprised to find that the two prisoners have been freed by Dalberg.

Seeing that the photographer is looking away, Dan moves his head to the side and snaps a picture of Buster without anybody noticing. Thus, when Dan escapes, the wanted posters all show Buster with his hands on the bars. Unaware, Buster moves on to a street corner, where he notices a horseshoe, and kicks it aside. The next man who comes along  picks it up and throws it for good luck. Within seconds the man finds a wallet filled with money. After scrambling to find the horseshoe, Buster picks it up and throws over his shoulder. It strikes a policeman, who chases Buster, and soon other officers join the chase. Buster lures them into the back of a truck, locks them in, and escapes.
Afterwards, Buster sees a man arguing with a young woman. Buster defends the woman and throws the man to the ground. After walking away, Buster runs into the officers who had chased him earlier. He escapes by hopping onto a train going to a nearby town. Unfortunately for Buster, the town has heard of Dan''s escape, and newspapers and wanted posters with Buster''s picture are everywhere. The townspeople run from him in terror wherever he goes.
Buster is once again in the wrong place at the wrong time when the police chief on his patrol is ambushed by a gangster. The gunman''s bullets miss the officer, but the smoking gun ends up in Buster''s hand. He runs from the persistent police chief, inadvertently causing mischief all over the town. While on the run, Buster encounters the same young woman he assisted earlier, who invites him to dinner. At her home he meets her father—he is the police chief, and he furiously chases Buster all over the apartment complex. After the young woman helps Buster escape, the pair emerge onto the street where Buster observes a sign outside a furniture store that says "You furnish the Girl, we furnish the home!" He carries his date into the store.

('tt0022879','free','A Farewell to Arms (1932)','1932','1h 20min','This is the plot of the original 1932 film, as it recently aired on Turner Classic Movies. The film suffered from editing and censorship even at its initial release . (See below.)

On the Italian front during World War I, Lieutenant Frederic Henry (Gary Cooper), an American architect serving as an officer on an ambulance in the Italian Army, delivers some wounded soldiers to a hospital. There he meets his best friend and “war brother,” Italian Captain Rinaldi (Adolphe Menjou), a brilliant surgeon. They go out carousing, but are interrupted by a bombing raid. Frederic and English Red Cross nurse Catherine Barkley (Helen Hayes), who fled from the nurses’ dormitory in her night clothes, take shelter in the same dark stairwell. The somewhat drunk Frederic makes a poor first impression, because he mistakes Catherine''s bare foot for that of the prostitute whose arch he was caressing as the bombs fell. He realizes his error when he tries to put the satin slipper he is carrying onto Catherine''s foot: The shoe is much too big.
Rinaldi persuades Frederic to go on a double date with him and two nurses, Catherine and her friend Helen Ferguson (Mary Philips). During a concert for officers and nurses, Rinaldi takes Catherine into the garden and goes to get them something to drink; Frederic sits down with Catherine, and when Rinaldi returns, they suggest that he bring out Miss Ferguson. They walk deeper into the garden and Catherine reveals that she had been engaged for eight years to a soldier who was killed in battle. Away by themselves, he tries to kiss her and she slaps him, but after they talk more, she asks him to kiss her again. In the darkness, he romantically seduces her, over her half-hearted resistance, and is taken aback and touched to discover she is a virgin. She talks bitterly about the whole situation and laughs hysterically, but he soothes her and begs her not to be sorry—he loves her.
Rinaldi is annoyed that Catherine prefers Frederic, but—after a brief, half-hearted attempt to implicate his best friend in Catherine''s disappearance from the party, does a fairly good job of covering up when Catherine''s absence from the concert is noticed.
Back in their room, Frederic puts on his pajamas and Rinaldi wakes and tries to find out exactly what happened. Frederic tells him repeatedly and angrily to “Shut up”—a sharp contrast to the easy way they discussed “girls” before they went to the brothel. In the dark, Frederic smokes a cigarette, and as Rinaldi watches the expression on his friend''s face, he shakes his head in concern.
In their shared bed in the nurses’ quarters, Catherine lies staring at the ceiling while Fergie rants about the “silly geese stuffed with bunk about women’s role in the war” whose ranks Catherine has now joined. She is furious and disappointed. If Catherine had known him for a long time, or been in love... but Catherine only knew him for a day! How can she be in love? He will be like all the soldiers who receive women''s sacrifices and never look back, much less come back. (It is never stated explicitly in the film whether Fergie''s own  heart has been broken by betrayal and/or death, or if she cannot bear the suffering she has seen around her.) Catherine says that she must have loved him, or it wouldn''t have happened. She muses that she probably won''t ever see him again, and it is not clear whether she is thinking of the vagaries of war or the possibility that he will be faithless.
In the morning, three ambulances, including Frederic''s, leave for what will be known as the Second Battle of the Piave River. Frederic tells his driver to turn back to the hospital. He strides into the courtyard to find Catherine. Meanwhile, Renaldi discovers the ambulance parked out front. The driver has confidence in the “Tenente’s” reasons for returning, but Rinaldi knows better.
Tongue-tied and stammering, Frederic tells Catherine he will be away and that he wants her to know that what happened between them was important to him. He is going to a “show up above Plava... Nothing much.” (In 1932, only 14 years after the Armistice, audience members familiar with the course of the Great War, and able to ignore the film''s occasional misspelling of the name as “Plava,” might have recognized that although the Italians were victorious this was a terrible battle with severe casualties on both sides.)
Catherine gives him the St. Anthony medal she wears around her neck, but they don''t kiss. Rinaldi and the senior British medical officer pause in the hallway to observe. In the major''s office, it is clear that Rinaldi has approached him to solve the problem of Frederic''s preoccupation with Miss Barkley. He does not wish his friend, a good soldier, to “lose his head over a woman.” The head nurse suggests sending Catherine back to base, but instead the Major (Gilbert Emery) transfers Catherine to Milan.
At the front, Frederic is badly wounded in the legs and head when his bunker is blown up by an artillery shell. With special permission, Rinaldi comes to the front to operate on his war brother. He promises that he has made arrangements to send Frederic to the English hospital in Milan to “the beautiful Miss Barkley” and babbles to him reassuringly until the anesthetic takes effect.
The camera switches briefly to Frederic''s point of view as he enters the hospital where Catherine now works. He receives a chilly reception from Ferguson, but Catherine rushes to his bed to embrace him. The matron reads his temperature and calls for the doctor, it is so high. Frederic chuckles.
In Frederic''s room, the night before another surgery on his legs, the (unnamed) Italian Army chaplain (Jack La Rue ) aka “Padre” has brought Frederic some gifts. Catherine comes in and as they banter with each other the priest, who knows both of them, sees in their faces that they are lovers—and in love. They are proud of it. He blames the war, and asks each in turn, if it weren''t for the war, would they marry? They say, yes. He turns his back and, hands folded, prays softly in Latin. Frederic recognizes the marriage service and they clasp hands. Catherine whispers “At least I’m in white.” The Priest says that that he cannot say they are married, but he can now give them his blessing, and does. Frederic persuades Catherine to shut the door: “It’s our wedding night.”
The months pass—July, August, September, October. They are in a café watching a puppet show with Fergie and a male friend, an opera singer who sounds like an American. (They don''t mention his name.) He leaves when Frederic teases him about his debut at La Scala. Catherine and Frederic talk about asking Fergie to their wedding, and Fergie, despairing, says they won''t marry. They''ll fight. Or die. That''s what people do. Choking back tears, she leaves, warning Frederic that if he gets Catherine in trouble, she will kill him.
Back at the hospital, the head nurse has discovered Frederic''s substantial and diverse cache of alcohol. She accuses him of malingering and alcoholism and promises to have his convalescent leave canceled.
The lovers wait for his train to the front in a room above a café across from the station: red plush, gilded mirrors and nude paintings. As they talk, Catherine confides her fear of the rain: She sometimes sees herself dead in it. Sometimes she sees him dead in it. He promises he will always come back, and at the door picks her up so they can kiss face to face without bending or reaching.  She weeps and collapses onto a chair as he leaves. Then she breaks her promise to him by going to the station to watch him get on the train. Then she walks to a ticket window, and Fergie appears. Catherine has summoned her to tell her of her plans. She is leaving that night for Switzerland, where she will have her child.
In a grubby garret, Catherine writes Frederic letters full of lies about her real situation. Back in Turin, Rinaldi tries to entice Frederic to the Villa Rosa to get drunk and enjoy some female company, but Frederic is intent on writing to Catherine. Rinaldi tells him that sacred subjects are no good for soldiers and spills the inkwell. He leaves Frederic to it, and is stopped by an orderly to censor the mail. When he sees the letter from Miss Barkley, he stamps it “return to sender,” repeating to the orderly the refrain “I do not like to see him lose his head over a woman.” Meanwhile, the hospital at Milan returns to Frederic all of his 32 letters, marked “person unknown.” He tells the Padre that he is deserting and going to Milan to find her.
A long (5 minutes and 45 seconds) montage of scenes along Frederic''s road show the horrors of modern war for soldiers and civilians alike. Eventually, Frederic is pulled aside for questioning and escapes by jumping into a nearby river. He slips into Turin aboard a train, under a tarp covering armament, eluding the Carabinieri who are looking for “stragglers.” Stragglers go back to the front. Deserters are shot.
He comes through the nurses’ dormitory bedroom window calling for Catherine, but only Fergie is there. Furious, she will tell him nothing except that Catherine was pregnant and is gone. Frederic goes to his operatic friend and asks him to place ads in the papers. Rinaldi reads one and meets Frederic, now in civilian dress, at his hotel. He tells him that everyone thought he was dead, but now he can certify Frederic as a case of shell shock and cure him. Harry, the waiter, alerts Frederic that someone is planning to betray him, but Frederic will not leave and risk missing word of Catherine. Frederic tells Rinaldi that Catherine is going to have a baby, and Rinaldi, recognizing what that means to Frederic, reveals that she is in Brissago, in Switzerland.
In a windy storm, Rinaldi sees Frederic into Harry''s rowboat. He gives Frederic a large sum of money and when Frederic calls him a good egg he says no, he is a fool. If he had known what Catherine meant to Frederic... He chokes up and they hug. Frederic rows 35 kilometers through a rainy night across  Lake Maggiore to his Catherine.
Meanwhile, Catherine is delighted when she is told she has finally received some mail, but faints when she is given all of her love letters, marked "Return to Sender". She is taken to the hospital, where she endures a prolonged, exhausting and unproductive labor, somewhat eased by anesthetic. She hallucinates, thinking that the surgeon is Frederic, taking his hand and telling him she has got past the point where she was going to die. She is in grave danger, and  Frederic arrives, wet and exhausted, just before she is wheeled into the operating room for a  Caesarean section.
After the operation, the surgeon tells Frederic that the baby, a boy, died in the womb long before Catherine came to the hospital. Another doctor tells Frederic to go across the street to get breakfast. In the café, a shattered Frederic is oblivious to the news of Armistice between Italy and Austria-Hungary that occupies all around him. He pleads with God to save Catherine and, unable to stomach food, returns to the hospital to wait.
At this point, the soundtrack begins to play strains of the Liebestod from Wagner''s Tristan und Isolde, which build until the climax at the end of the film.
When Catherine regains consciousness, she knows she is dying and doesn''t want Frederic told. The nurses comb her hair and help her to use powder and rouge to cover her pallor. Frederic comes in, and in the pre-dawn light they exchange heartbreaking endearments and plan the future, until Catherine panics and begs Frederic to hold her tight because she is going to die and is afraid. He soothes her and tells her they can never really be parted, that she is a fine, brave girl. She believes him, tells him she is not afraid, and, on those words, dies in his arms as the sun rises, the music swells, and a cacophony of bells, steam whistles and firecrackers (or gunfire) sounds. Frederic picks up her body and turns slowly toward the window, sobbing “Peace, Peace.” A brief cut to a sky filled with doves, and the resolution of the Liebestod plays over “The End”
This is the original ending of the film when released to international audiences in 1932.  Some prints for American audiences had a happy ending, where Catherine did not die, and some were ambiguous;  some theaters were offered a choice. The censors were concerned about more than just the heroine''s death.  Versions proliferated when a much more powerful Motion Picture Production Code got hold of the picture before various re-releases to film and television, not to mention the effects of a change of ownership to Warner Bros. and lapse into the public domain.  This is why film critic and Turner Classic Movies host Ben Mankiewicz, after an airing of the original version, summed up the film''s history as “confusing.”
According to TCM.com: “ ‘A Farewell to Arms’ originally ran 89 minutes, and was later cut to 78 minutes for a 1938 re-issue.

It was criticized by one commentator as a "bitter and angry anti-German propaganda film" that characterized the post-war German mind as "diseased".The film urged against fraternization with the German people, who are portrayed as thoroughly untrustworthy. It reminds its viewers of Germany''s history of aggression, under "Führer Number 1" Otto von Bismarck, "Führer Number 2" Kaiser Wilhelm II and "Führer Number 3" Adolf Hitler. It argues that the German youth are especially dangerous because they had spent their entire lives under the Nazi regime.
The policy of non-fraternisation – where US soldiers were forbidden to speak even to small children – was first announced to the soldiers in the film:

The Nazi party may be gone, but Nazi thinking, Nazi training and Nazi trickery remains. The German lust for conquest is not dead. ... You will not argue with them. You will not be friendly. ... There will be no fraternization with any of the German people.
The basic theme that the German people could not be trusted derived from the peace policy that emerged from the Second Quebec Conference.The movie was first screened to the top US generals, including Dwight D. Eisenhower. George Patton reportedly walked out of the screening he attended, saying "Bullshit!".','["Frank Capra"]',NULL,'["Adolf Hitler","John Lund"]','[""]','5.0','["tt3755706","tt2182057","tt2338356","tt3476724","tt0059512","tt0081404","tt0028669","tt0045328","tt0027214","tt0037773","tt0025094","tt1763236"]','["WWII","US Army","Reconstruction (1939-1951) -- Germany","Training Film","World War, 1939-1945","Dr Seuss","World War II","World War II: Postwar Issues"]','[{"url":"/YourJobInGermany1945.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/YourJobInGermany1945_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','YourJobInGermany1945',5797,'Q8058834','wp','["Dr. Seuss"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

('tt0033287','free','Young Buffalo Bill (1940)','1940','59min','The film takes place in the New Mexico territory of the United States in the 1860s. Bill Cody and his friend Gabby Whitaker arrive in the New Mexico territory sometime in the 1860s, Gabby feels the land is worthless as it is filled with nothing but “Injins and rocks”. Bill begins discussing Buffalo until he notices a woman driving a seemingly out of control carriage. Bill and Gabby stop the horses, but the woman berates them saying she didn’t any help.
In town Bill and Gabby are talking about the previous events, when the woman overhears their conversation and introduces herself as Tonia Regas. Tonia asks both men what they are doing in Santa Fe and Bill says they were called to do a land survey by U.S Colonel, Joseph Calhoun. Upon hearing this Tonia leaves.
At Colonel Calhoun’s homestead, Gabby introduces the Colonel to Bill. Calhoun reveals he knows Bill through his excellent reputation with the Pony Express and as a Buffalo hunter. Calhoun tells the men that his men have been having trouble with a medicine man named Akuna. Gabby and Bill agree to help.
Meanwhile Tonia arrives at her home where her grandfather, Don Regas tells her she must never go into town alone again. Don Regas then expresses his disdain with the survey by the American government to his friend Emelio Montez. Later, Montez sends a message to his half-brother, Akuna and Akuna’s men ride out with rifles. 
Akuna and his men meet with Montez. Akuna reveals they were born from the same mother, but Montez’s father was a white man. Montez asks for the location of a gold mine the Regas’ land. Akuna laments, saying the location is only for the chief, referring to himself, to know. Montez says he will find a way to acquire the land from Regas and claim the land for their tribe.
Later Colonel Calhoun’s son Jerry arrives in Santa Fe. Colonel Calhoun introduces Jerry to Bill and Gabby, and then tells Jerry that although a more experienced is needed, he took a chance to help his son.
Jerry accompanies, the surveyors out to part of the Regas land where they are attacked by Akuna’s men, but they it out alive with only one men being injured. Back in town Jerry and Don Regas discuss the land agreement. Bill tells Tonia that the survey is only a formality and when the survey is all over the ranch will still belong to her family. Tonia and Bill help Jerry convince Don Regas to allow the survey and he complies.
Jerry spends his nights at a cantina gambling away his money. Bill expresses his concern with Jerry’s habit, but Jerry rebuffs him. Jerry soon finds himself $4,000 in debt to the cantina. Montez takes advantages of Jerry’s misfortune and offers to erase the debt if Jerry uses to survey to make sure the northern part of the Regas land is not part of the survey. Jerry forges the survey, saying the northern territory does not belong to Don Regas and it is free land.
Bill and Gabby arrive at the Regas house to inform them that the survey has been completed. He is not there, but Tonia offers to take Bill inside to discuss business. Bill tells Tonia the news as Don Regas walks in, both are angry and accuse Bill and the American government of trying to cheat them. An outraged Don Regas announces he will take his matter to Washington and makes preparations to leave in the morning. Tonia is distraught with Bill and says she never wants to see him again. 
Later Jerry meets with Montez. Jerry knows that his survey won’t hold up if investigated by Washington. Montez reveals his plan to kill Don Regas. Jerry wants no part in this and attempts to inform his father, but Montez subdues him before he can leave and later has Akuna hold him hostage.
Montez has Akuna hide Jerry’s body and asks his half-brother to kill Don Regas. Bill and Gabby soon find out about the Montez’s plan and rush off to stop it. 
Akuna and his men attack Don Regas and his caravan. Killing his drivers and gunners, the carriage overturns and Regas is shot trying to defend himself. Bill and Gabby try to shoot Akuna, but they are out of range.
Bill and Gabby take Don Regas back to town for him to recuperate. Akuna goes to Montez to deliver the news, but when Montez asks for the dead Akuna reveals he did not have time to search for it. They return to the wreckage only to find that Don Regas’ body has been moved. Montez sets off to get to the bottom of the situation. 
Back at the Regas house, Tonia confronts Bill about the attack on her grandfather. They are interrupted by Montez who tries to kill them. Montez flees while Bill and Gabby give chase. Montez, thinking he has lost them, leads Bill and Gabby directly to Akuna’s hideout. Bill and Gabby make their way past two guards and into the room where Jerry is being held. Akuna and his men begin firing on the room where the three men are, leaving them trapped. Montez and Akuna lead a ride into town to attack the Regas house, while arrow shooters surround Bill, Gabby and Jerry.
Bill notices and old war bugle in the room and has Gabby play it to scatter the Akuna’s remaining men. The olan works and the three escape for town. At the Regas home, the workers are trying to defend the home from Akuna’s attack. Meanwhile Colonel Calhoun and his men set out for Akuna’s hideout, but Gabby attempts to lead them back to the Regas house. 
Bill arrives at the Regas before Montez can reach Talia and her grandfather and Bill manages to subdue Montez. Akuna and his men are beaten by Colonel Joseph Calhoun and his men. After the commotion, Jerry comes clean about forging the survey and Tonia reconciles with Bill.

('tt0042869','free','Quicksand (1950)','1950','1h 19min','Dan Brady (Mickey Rooney), a young auto mechanic in California, takes $20 (equivalent to $208 in 2018) from a cash register at work to go on a date with blonde femme fatale Vera Novak (Jeanne Cagney). Brady intends to put the money back before it is missed, but the garage''s bookkeeper shows up earlier than scheduled. As Brady scrambles to cover evidence of his petty theft, he quickly finds himself drawn into an ever-worsening "quicksand" of crime, each of his misdeeds more serious than the last. 
He buys a $100 wristwatch (equivalent to $1,041 in 2018) on installment payments and then promptly pawns the watch for $30 cash, using part of that money to cover the missing funds from the register at work. However, Brady is then threatened with grand larceny for violating the installment contract by selling a watch that he doesn''t legally own. The finance company demands payment in full for the watch within 24 hours. After unsuccessfully applying for a payday loan and attempting to use his car as collateral for another loan, a desperate Brady resorts to mugging a tipsy bar patron known for carrying large amounts of cash. 
Nick Dramoshag (Peter Lorre), the seedy owner of a penny arcade on Santa Monica Pier and a man who has had his own intimate history with Vera, discovers evidence of Brady''s mugging. He blackmails the young mechanic, demanding a car from Brady''s job in exchange for his silence. Brady steals the car, which he trades for the evidence from Dramoshag. Brady''s morally lacking boss Oren Mackey (Art Smith) soon confronts Brady and says he knows that he stole the car. Mackey demands the return of the vehicle or $3,000 in cash (equivalent to $31,000 in 2018), or he will go to the police. 
Brady and Vera steal the month-end receipts from Dramoshag''s arcade, obtaining $3,610 ($37,593). Brady expects to use the money to pay Mackey.  Vera, however, feels entitled to half the money, so she buys herself a mink coat for $1,800 ($18,744).  Once Brady learns what she has done, he is furious.  He leaves Vera and returns to the garage, where he offers Mackey $1,800 to settle their arrangement.  Mackey takes the money, but he draws a pistol and says he refuses to settle.  The two men struggle when Mackey tries to telephone the police, and Brady strangles him in their altercation.  Certain that his boss is dead, Brady takes Mackey''s gun and returns to Vera to inform her of what he has done.  He asks her to flee with him to Texas.  She will not go, insisting that the authorities have no evidence against her. Disgusted by Vera''s self-serving behavior, Dan ends their relationship and departs.
Outside of Vera''s apartment, Brady''s still-loyal but unappreciated former girlfriend Helen (Barbara Bates) waits in his car to talk with him. She had seen him earlier on the street and realized then that he was in trouble.  She now decides to accompany "Danny" as they drive out of town to avoid his anticipated arrest for murder.  After his car breaks down, Brady carjacks a sedan, which happens to be driven by a sympathetic lawyer (Taylor Holmes).  Brady subsequently gets out of that car when they arrive at Santa Monica Pier.  There he tells Helen to remain with the lawyer as he carries out his new plan to escape to Mexico on a friend''s charter boat.  He also assures Helen that he will send for her once he is safely resettled across the border.  Brady rushes away to catch the boat.  A few minutes later, the lawyer and Helen hear over the sedan''s radio a news report that Mackey is actually not dead, that the shady auto dealer had survived his injuries.  They now drive back to the pier to find Dan and inform him that he is not a murderer.  Meanwhile, police officers spot Brady there, wound him by gunfire in an ensuing chase, and take him into custody.  The film concludes with Helen, now on the scene, comforting Dan and promising to wait for him until he is released from prison.','["Irving Pichel"]',NULL,'["Mickey Rooney","Jeanne Cagney","Barbara Bates"]','["Crime","Drama","Film-Noir","Mystery","Romance"]','6.6','["tt0046329","tt0041503","tt0037634","tt0032424","tt0038937","tt0026293","tt0037539","tt0034828","tt0042369","tt0038782","tt0024258","tt0038409"]','["suspense;noir;crime;Mickey Rooney;Peter Lorre;Jack Elam"]','[{"url":"/Quicksand.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Quicksand_clear_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','Quicksand_clear',310950,'Q3944269','wp','["Robert Smith"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

His only son François considers the whole set-up archaic and, while his father is on a business trip to the USA, starts jazzing up the staid newspaper. On his return, the father is furious and decides to teach his son a lesson. He tells François that he can have the run-down sugar business, to manage as he pleases. Painfully lacking the necessary expertise, the young man launches into enthusiastic modernisation and expansion. It is rapidly brought home to him that he needs capital, which he will have to raise. 
When his father tells him he is on his own, he turns to their cousin Maublanc, a malicious playboy who for several reasons hates the Schoudlers. One immediate grievance is that he asked their newspaper to promote his latest mistress, an aspiring actress called Sylvaine, and was not only refused but Noël''s devious assistant Lachaume (having just made Noël''s niece pregnant) took over the young woman. Feigning helpfulness to François, Maublanc says he will arrange everything with his brokers, but in fact tells them to leak the news that the Schoudler empire has run out of capital. As this will depress the share price, his plan is to buy a controlling interest on the cheap. When the market price starts falling, François is in despair and Maublanc tells him that the only decent thing to do is to put a bullet through his head. Unfortunately, the impressionable young man does so. Noël then goes down to the stock exchange where, speaking to brokers, he reassures them that his businesses are sound. The share price soars and Maublanc''s plot is foiled.','["Denys de La Patellière"]','["Denys de La Patellière","Michel Audiard"]','["Jean Gabin","Annie Ducaux","Jean Desailly"]','["Drama"]','7.0','["tt0054734","tt0049877","tt0059823","tt0055336","tt0052573","tt0050669","tt0054425","tt0046451","tt0051579","tt0064294","tt0053230","tt0057344"]','["denys; patelliere; grandes; familles; michel; audiard; jean; gabin"]','[{"url":"/LesGrandesFamilles-1958-DenysDeLaPatelliere_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/LesGrandesFamilles-1958-DenysDeLaPatelliere_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','LesGrandesFamilles-1958-DenysDeLaPatelliere',23540,'Q3233029','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Her father is a disdainful and morose man fixated at the dishonorable discharge of his son Robert and isn''t at all happy with the prospect of having Laddie as a son-in-law forbidding Pamela''s hand in marriage to Laddie a "field hand".

Pamela tries to make Laddie get another profession, to please her father and to be able to continue their relation. The insulted Laddie is very upset and regards Pamela''s plead as disrespectful to him and his family. After speaking with his family, Laddie decides to prove himself to Mr.Pryor by buying a portion of his estate and grabs his attention as he begins to farm on his plot of land. This infuriates Mr.Pryor who rejects the sale of his land to Laddie and further worsens his hopes of marrying Pamela. Furthermore, Pamela perceives Laddie''s actions as childlike and unhelpful. 
However, from Pamela''s introduction in the film, Laddie''s kid sister, commonly referred to as ''Little Sister'', sees Pamela as ''the princess'' and as the woman who is meant to be with Laddie and thus, she attempts to reconcile the lovers and their relationship. When her initial efforts are unsuccessful, Little Sister sees her opportunity when Robert Pryor, Mr.Pryor''s disowned and disgraced son, comes to visit and falls ill.
Upon Pamela''s request, the Stanton family takes him in when his father doesn''t and call Dr.Barnes to help take care of him. While ''hunting'' in the woods, Little Sister comes across Mr.Pryor and mistakenly blurts out that Robert is staying with them. The old man is infuriated and goes to visit the family immediately with the intent to kill his disgraceful son.  When Little Sister informs Laddie of her encounter, Laddie stands up to Mr.Pryor demanding that he leave his gun behind before he can enter their house. After this, Mr. and Mrs. Stanton mitigate Mr. Pryor''s anger by retelling the story of the prodigal son and informing him of Robert''s illness. After accepting the Stanton family''s wisdom, Mr.Pryor forgives his son and gives Pamela''s hand in marriage to Laddie.
Later on, we see the teary eyed Pamela apologize to Laddie belittling his family and their profession of farming. The two lovers are reconciled.','["Jack Hively"]','["Gene Stratton-Porter","Jerome Cady"]','["Tim Holt","Virginia Gilmore","Joan Carroll"]','["Drama"]','6.6','["tt0033221","tt0031619","tt0032339","tt0044926","tt0046786","tt0040416","tt0050280","tt0026592","tt0088108","tt0048937","tt0068713","tt0335734"]','["Gene Stratton-Porter"]','[{"url":"/Laddie_1940.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Laddie_1940_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','Laddie_1940',12270,'Q12125456','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Maria is very much in charge, killing the children and replacing their brains with artificial ones, intending to revive them as her slaves. Rudolph, however, is reluctant to help his sister, but is too afraid of her to do otherwise. After a number of failures (owing to Rudolph secretly poisoning the victims as soon as his sister revives them), they are finding it increasingly difficult to hide the trail of bodies. Down the road, Mañuel Lopez and his wife Nina decide to leave town with their daughter Juanita because of the frequent disappearances, the latest of which is that of their son.
Two gunslingers come to town, Jesse James, the infamous outlaw, who has actually survived his reported killing on April 3, 1882, and Hank Tracy, a dimwitted brute that Jesse uses as his henchman. Meeting up with Butch Curry, the head of a local gang called The Wild Bunch, they join up with the intention of stealing $100,000 from the next stagecoach. However, a member of the gang, Butch''s own brother Lonny, decides to go to the sheriff and let him know about the plot in exchange for becoming his deputy and claiming the reward for James'' capture. As the robbery begins, the sheriff and his men shoot the two remaining members of the Wild Bunch and seriously wound Hank.
Jesse and Hank escape and stop at the Lopez''s campout to tend to Hank''s wound and sleep until the morning.  During the middle of the night, Juanita wakes up Jesse and Hank and leads them back to town to the Frankensteins'' house to fix up Hank despite her parents forbidding her to go back there. Maria agrees to help, and even covers for her guests when the sheriff and Lonny come around looking for them, but her actual plan is to use Hank as another one of her experiments.  After a failed attempt to seduce Jesse, Maria sends him to the town pharmacist with a note, then begins operating on Hank, giving him an artificial new brain and bringing him back to life.  Rudolph tries to poison Hank, now called Igor, but Maria catches him this time and orders her new monster to strangle her brother.
Jesse gives the pharmacist the note from Maria, which actually reveals his identity, prompting the pharmacist to call the sheriff. The sheriff is out, but his deputy Lonny decides to take on Jesse for the reward on his head.  Jesse manages to escape, killing Lonny in the process. When he returns to the Frankensteins'' house, Igor incapacitates him and ties him up.
Realizing Jesse is in trouble, Juanita sends the sheriff to the house, where he finds Jesse and prepares to take him in.  But Maria sends Igor to crush the sheriff.  During the scuffle, Juanita frees Jesse and tries to escape.  Maria orders Igor to go kill Juanita, but he strangles Maria instead and goes after Jesse. Juanita gets Jesse''s gun and kills Igor.
The next morning, as Jesse buries Hank, Juanita pleads with him to stay and live with her, but Jesse, knowing that he is a fugitive, rides off with the sheriff, who was not killed by Igor.','["William Beaudine"]',NULL,'["John Lupton","Narda Onyx","Cal Bolder"]','["Horror","Sci-Fi","Western"]','3.2','["tt0060168","tt0059199","tt0050530","tt0038621","tt0038129","tt0045631","tt0051631","tt0060548","tt0027800","tt0033879","tt0078317","tt0033728"]','["Horror; comedy; Frankenstein; monster; public domain; feature length movie"]','[{"url":"/JesseJamesMeetsFrankensteinsDaughter1966.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/JesseJamesMeetsFrankensteinsDaughter1966_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/JesseJamesMeetsFrankensteinsDaughter1966_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','JesseJamesMeetsFrankensteinsDaughter1966',29494,'Q1609438','wp','["Carl K.

Harold invites him along on a boat trip during which all three try out some newly bought scuba diving equipment. When they resurface, they are unable to breathe without using their scuba tanks. They climb back into their boat and find Manuel, the crewman, dead, apparently of asphyxiation. Upon rowing ashore, they enter the jungle.

The domineering Harold takes charge. They concentrate on becoming self-sufficient, and the two men fish, as marine creatures have survived. Later, they also find living insects and baby chicks, presumably newly hatched. Harold feels that in the long run, they will have to move north to a colder climate to avoid problems with insects and food preservation and to increase their chances of meeting other survivors.

Pete attempts to kick him, but Mickey rushes away in time and Pete accidentally kicks himself in the rear. Mickey rushes down the stairs, slips on a bar of soap on the boat''s deck and lands in a bucket of water. A parrot laughs at him, and Mickey throws the bucket at it.
Pete, who has been watching the whole thing, pilots the steamboat himself. He bites off some chewing tobacco and spits into the wind. The spit flies backward and rings the boat''s bell. Amused by this, Pete spits again, but this time the spit hits him in the face, making him fuss.
The steamboat makes a stop at "Podunk Landing" to pick up a cargo of various livestock. Just as they set off again, Minnie appears, running to catch the boat before it leaves. Mickey does not see her in time, but she runs after the boat along the shore and Mickey takes her on board by hooking the cargo crane to her underwear.
Landing on deck, Minnie accidentally drops a ukulele and some sheet music for the song "Turkey in the Straw", which are eaten by a goat. The two mice use the goat''s body as a phonograph, which they play by turning its tail like a crank. Mickey uses various objects on the boat as percussion accompaniment and "plays" the animals like musical instruments.

She finds a fan which enables her to shrink enough to get into the door to a. "Garden" and try to get a dog to play with her. She enters the "White Rabbit''s Tiny House", but suddenly enlarges to her normal size. In order to get out, she used the fan.
She enters in a kitchen, in which there is a cook and a woman holding a baby. She persuades the woman to give her the child and takes the infant outside after the cook starts throwing things around.

The Duchess''s "Cheshire Cat" appears and disappears a couple of times to Alice and directs her to the Mad Hatter''s "Mad Tea-Party". After a while, she leaves.
The Queen invites Alice to join the royal procession, a parade of marching playing cards and others, headed by the White Rabbit.

After learning of a golf tournament their company is sponsoring, in which cash prizes will be awarded, the boys  quickly drive off to the Rancho Golf Club. To gain access they impersonate reporters by using knobs torn from bathroom fixtures as press badges. The ruse barely succeeds—Moe''s and Larry''s are marked "press", but Curly''s reads "pull". Once inside, the Stooges steal some golfers'' clothes, and split up to practice—although they know absolutely nothing about golf.
Curly gets his golf ball stuck in the tree and decides the only way to retrieve it is by chopping the tree down. Moe finds an open area to practice, but the only thing that he hits is the ground, which is soon pockmarked with hundreds of divots. Larry practices putting, but a root gets in his way, and he tears up the putting green in his efforts to extract the seemingly endless root. All of this destruction is noticed by the two outraged and angry Italian-ethnicity groundskeepers, to one of whom Moe''s explanation of the field of divots was, was that "The Pieces are getting Smaller" - this drives the groundskeepers to complain to the golf course''s management personnel, who respond by sending the police in pursuit of the trio.
The Stooges escape in their beer truck. As they drive up a steep hill, two barrels fall off the truck and roll away. Parking the truck, the Stooges give chase but to no avail. It gets worse when the parked truck''s brake loosens and the truck rolls into a curb, jarring loose the rest of the barrels which head downhill as well—directly toward the Stooges, who are hurled into a freshly laid sidewalk of wet cement.','["Del Lord"]','["Clyde Bruckman","Clyde Bruckman"]','["Moe Howard","Larry Fine","Curly Howard"]','["Short","Comedy","Sport"]','8.2','["tt0025688","tt0025889","tt0026878","tt0026848","tt0026479","tt0025488","tt0027152","tt0027301","tt0026000","tt0027993","tt0026494","tt0026925"]','["The Three Stooges;Moe;Curly;Shemp;Howard;Larry;Fine;slapstick"]','[{"url":"/TheThreeStoogesInThreeLittleBeers.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/TheThreeStoogesInThreeLittleBeers_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/TheThreeStoogesInThreeLittleBeers_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','TheThreeStoogesInThreeLittleBeers',65454,'Q7797578','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
('tt0006414','free','Behind the Screen (1916)','1916','30min','The film takes place in a silent movie studio. Charlie Chaplin plays stagehand named David who has an enormous supervisor named Goliath (Eric Campbell). David is overworked but is still labelled as a loafer by the lazy Goliath and his supervisor.  A country girl (Edna Purviance) arrives at the studio in hopes of becoming an actress, but is quickly turned away by Goliath.  Most of the other stagehands go on wildcat strike to protest their sleep being interrupted during their lunch break.  Only David and Goliath remain on the job.  The girl returns and stealthily dresses in one of the striking stagehand''s work clothes.  Disguised as a man, she gets a job as a stagehand too.  David discovers that the new stagehand is actually a female.  When he gives her a series of quick kisses, the action is seen by Goliath who makes effeminate gestures at David.  Edna overhears the strikers'' plans to blow up the studio with dynamite and helps thwart their villainous plot.
Much of the film is slapstick comedy involving Chaplin manhandling large props, mishandling the control to a trap door, and engaging in a raucous pie-throwing fight which spills over into another studio where a period drama is being shot.  In one scene Chaplin deftly carries 11 chairs over his back in his left hand and lifts a piano in his right hand.
Behind the Screen was the last of Chaplin''s comedies to use a movie studio as a backdrop.  Earlier Chaplin films, such as A Film Johnnie, His New Job, and The Masquerader had also been set, at least partly, in a silent movie studio.  In Behind the Screen, Chaplin pokes gentle fun at Keystone Studios where he broke into the movies in 1914 and worked under contract for Mack Sennett for a year.  The pie-throwing sequence is an obvious allusion to the Keystone style of slapstick comedies where such skirmishes were overly common.  One intertitle humorously refers to the pie-throwing gimmick as "a new idea."','["Charles Chaplin"]',NULL,'["Charles Chaplin","Edna Purviance","Eric Campbell"]','[""]','7.0','["tt0006548","tt0007264","tt0007162","tt0006689","tt0006684","tt0007832","tt0007507","tt0007613","tt0007880","tt0007194","tt0008133","tt0006032"]','["Charlie Chaplin; Silents"]','[{"url":"/CC_1916_11_13_BehindtheScreen_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/CC_1916_11_13_BehindtheScreen_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','CC_1916_11_13_BehindtheScreen',51389,'Q2345856','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

He is two-timing his wife, Alma Thornton, as well as Lola Cresmer, her sister Anice Cresmer, and Doris Manning, three actresses in the play. Thornton has been nice to Geraldine, the chimpanzee, and she has a crush on the handsome man. Geraldine has figured out how to open and close her wheeled cage, numbered "7", which is in the Property Room of the theater. Mack, the property master, does not like that, or her, and mistreats the "monk". In the Property Room, Geraldine gets her hands on a .32 caliber unrifled revolver and in handling the gun, accidentally fires it.
Roaming the dressing rooms, Geraldine takes a photograph of Thornton from his room back to her cage.  Upset by Thornton''s two-timing, Anice Cresmer, who plays "Tonga" in "Isle of Romance", takes her own life; she is found by her sister Lola. Wylie Thornton has gambling debts and in a row with his wife, Alma, gets called a "cackling boudoir rooster" and a "flannel mouth Romeo". Alma takes his money and then gives Wylie forty dollars while making him owe her seventy five dollars. Wylie Thornton is leaving for a bigger engagement in New York and a farewell party is held for him. He gets a birthday cake with thirty four candles; Mack, who was putting in the candles, says "that ham is forty four if he''s a day". Geraldine, on the loose again, has evaded the property master and climbs up into the flies of the theater. In preparation for the presentation of the cake, the lighting on stage is turned off and the lit cake is brought out, to everyone''s delight.  Thornton blows out the candles.
In the darkness, a shot rings out and is followed by screams like those that a chimpanzee would make. When the lights come back on, Thornton is found dead. This precipitates the arrival of the young and quick to jump to conclusions Captain Marty Gallagher, the Captain of Detectives, whose catch phrase is "It''s in the bag!". Mooney, the newspaper reporter, calls him "''Arrest ''em in a hurry'' Gallagher". Another detective, the older and methodical Jim Handley, labeled by Gallagher as the "new dick from the D.A.''s office", is also on the case. Mooney tags along with Gallagher and occasionally gives him some tips. While Gallagher is getting everyone locked up, Handley finds the revolver in a drop hanging from the flies. Alma Thornton is found shot in her apartment. In the operating room, Handley is told that in her delirium, Alma has been saying "lovely".
That leads him to question Loveley Holmes about the Thornton''s and the gambling debts. Handley returns to the theater to find a crowd outside the Property Room. He goes in and finds the room in disorder and Geraldine on the loose. Firing a shot, he orders her to get back into her cage, to which she complies. Handley then finds the prop master in the room, dead. Gallagher arrives and quickly wraps up the case. As Handley is leaving the theater, he meets Lola. He tells her that he would have done the same thing if that was his sister, meaning that he would have shot Thornton just as she had. He tells her that she does not have to worry, as Gallagher proved it was the chimpanzee that shot Wylie Thornton and that Lovely Holmes will be charged with shooting Alma Thornton.','["E.

Boarding a train bound for New York City, Prof. Post encounters James (Jimmy Durante), the manager of a dancing troupe that has an engagement in the backwater town of Fish''s Switch. The professor becomes infatuated with one of the dancers, Pansy Peets (Ruth Selwyn), and accidentally alights at Fish''s Switch when attempting to learn her name. He attends a performance by the dancing troupe at the local theatre, and is impressed by their act.
Feeling that the troupe should continue their act, the professor finances the troupe and takes them to perform on Broadway, but only after James insists that the act be improved to a higher standard. Post''s suggestions of using inspiration from Ancient Greece are taken on board, with some minor alterations, and the show is turned into a grandiose musical revue. Although Post wishes that Pansy be the leading lady, the show is quickly turned into a star-vehicle for spoiled actress Eleanor Espere (Thelma Todd), who attempts to win over the professor in order to take total control over both the show and the money it is expected to earn at its debut. Pansy attempts to warn the professor of Eleanor''s bad influence, with mixed results.
On the night of the show''s debut, James discovers that Prof. Post does not really have the $750,000 he believes to possess and attempts to keep him away from the production for fear of ruining it. The professor stumbles on-stage at several points, amusing the audience who think it to be part of the act, and ensuring the success of the show.

Sea Tiger is assigned the top secret mission of sinking Nazi Germany''s new battleship, the Brandenburg, before she enters the Kiel Canal to begin sea trials in the Baltic Sea.
On their way, the submarine picks up three shot-down Luftwaffe pilots from a rescue buoy. When the submarine enters a minefield, an airman panics and reveals that the Brandenburg is further ahead than believed. Taylor decides to take a desperate gamble and enter the German-controlled Baltic in pursuit.
When the Brandenburg is spotted, Sea Tiger fires all its torpedoes, then dives to evade German destroyers dropping depth charges.

The woman is married to the son of a doctor, the proprietor of a private sanatorium, where she is under unwilling treatment.  Both the son and the doctor indicate they want the marriage dissolved. Arriving at the scene is a mysterious personage (Bela Lugosi) identified as the doctor''s cousin who had been a stage magician in Europe.  He is accompanied by a threatening dwarf (Angelo Rossitto).  
After it is apparent that the wife is terrified of the foreigners, it is disclosed that she is the former wife and stage partner of a Paris magician known as René, who was believed to have been shot by the Nazis. Attempts to draw a confession that she had betrayed her magician husband and had collaborated with the Nazis led to the use of a device employing a death mask of the supposedly dead patriot, which literally frightens her to death.

('tt0139148','free','A Defeated People (1946)','1946','18min','The film opens with a map of the German zones of occupation with the British zone highlighted. Voiceovers in a variety of English class accents offer a snapshot of what is being said about Germany in Britain ("They asked for it and they got it!", "You can''t let them starve", "As far as I can see it''d be a good thing if some of them did die"). A series of images shows the country''s shattered infrastructure, with destroyed roads, bridges, railway lines and factories. This is followed by shots of missing persons noticeboards and posters with the information that 30 million Germans – almost half the population – are still looking for lost relatives and friends.
Destitute children are seen sitting aimlessly in the streets. A shot of a woman nursing a baby is accompanied with the statement "We can''t wash our hands of the Germans, because we can''t afford that new life to flow in any direction it wants". The military authorities are shown mobilising civilians to begin the task of cleaning up and rebuilding, and it is explained that the aim is to prevent not only starvation and epidemics, but also "diseases of the mind", i.e. "new brands of Fascism".
People are shown living in the cellars of bombed buildings, without heat, light, water or sanitation. Coal is singled out as the single most vital resource, with the British "Coal Control" unit organising the output and distribution of the Ruhr coalfield production. A Catch-22 situation is detailed, whereby coal is needed for power and transport, but without the power and transport infrastructure already in place the coal cannot be moved to where it needs to be. There is no coal to spare for civilian use, so the populace have to forage for timber as a power source. Civilian railway travel on what survives of the network is only possible with a permit issued by the military authorities, but the volume of passengers still overwhelms the capacity. A train is seen leaving Hamburg for Kiel with dozens of people riding the buffers or hanging on the outside, ignoring loudhailer announcements that this is forbidden.
The establishment of a new German police force is outlined, with the explanation that henceforth the policeman "must understand that he is the servant of the public, and not its master". Civilians receive food rations of between 1000 and 1200 calories per day. Survey teams from the Red Cross carry out tests on health to check whether the rations are adequate to keep people fit enough to work. Education is mentioned as a particular headache, as "you will never get Nazi ideas out of the heads of some of the adults". Children are seen playing among the ruins, but a new breed of teacher is being recruited to teach the next generation that "there are other things in life beyond Nazism and war". However schools and teachers are too few and children too many. The problem is that children are growing up "and getting more like their fathers".
The Krupp family industrial dynasty is singled out for mention as "just as responsible for killing Allied soldiers as Hitler and Göring". Footage is shown of their destroyed ammunition and armaments factories. Surviving members of the Wehrmacht are seen being processed. These men must be reassimilated into society somehow, "not only their bodies, but also their minds". If so much as one man or woman is appointed to office while still believing in Nazi values and German supremacy, "you have the beginnings of another war". Therefore, they are all put through a rigorous demobilisation screening process. Anyone who is on the wanted list, or otherwise suspect in any way. is rejected for demobilisation and sent "back to the cage".
When the nightly curfew falls, the civilian population must get off the streets and fix for themselves as best they can. Air-raid sirens sound "to remind them that it is up to them to regain their self-respect as a nation". The film ends with images of children dancing in a ring accompanied by the statement that the Allies will remain until they can be sure that the next generation will represent "a Germany of light and life and freedom...truth, tolerance and justice".','["Humphrey Jennings"]',NULL,NULL,'[""]','6.4','["tt0153033","tt0139191","tt0035881","tt0034978","tt0034401","tt0150241"]','["archives.gov;public.resource.org"]','[{"url":"/gov.archives.arc.36087_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/gov.archives.arc.36087_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','gov.archives.arc.36087',3485,'Q4656385','wp',NULL,NULL,'["William Hartnell"]',NULL,NULL,NULL),

However, the restaurant has run out, so he invites her to his apartment. Before they arrive, Abel, another hungry, unemployed person, sneaks in for a chicken leg. Hearing them coming, he hides in a bedroom. When Jennie enters to remove her coat, he begs her not to cause trouble. She sympathizes with his plight and says nothing to Cooper.
Just then, Hugo Brant (Francis L. Sullivan), Cooper’s gangster employer, and his men barge in. They make Jennie leave. When Cooper admits that he is quitting, Brant shoots him dead. To get rid of loose ends, Brant sends Jennie aboard the ocean liner for Southampton, escorted by his sidekick Harrigan. He frames Jennie for robbery.
Meanwhile, Abel, who was caught by the building watchman as he tried to leave, is tried and sentenced to death for Cooper''s murder. The woman he insists can exonerate him is in prison, unaware of his plight. Brant and gang member Mortimer travel to England to deal with Jennie.
When Jennie is released from her prison sentence for robbery, her mother introduces her to her new tenant, a priest named Mr. Mortimer. After reading in the newspaper about Abel''s impending execution, she goes to Scotland Yard, despite Mortimer''s warning that she might become a suspect. She finds that other women have turned up, all claiming to be the missing witness. Inspector Jim Grant is skeptical, and that turns into certainty when Mortimer shows up and discredits her.
Meanwhile, Brant, under the alias of would-be Paraguayan dictator "General Costello", receives a message informing him of developments. The messenger, Spurgeon (Peter Bull), later sneaks back and collects the torn-up pieces to sell to blackmailer Sam Pryor (Frank Cellier). Spurgeon also sells to Inspector Grant the information that Pryor will be flying to New York for blackmail.
With only days before Abel’s execution and insufficient money for airfare, Jennie stows away on the Atlantic Airlines "Lisbon Clipper", a giant transatlantic flying boat. Paying passengers include Brant, 14-year-old violin prodigy Arnold James (Desmond Tester) and his aunt Veronica (Athene Seyler), Pryor and Inspector Grant. Jennie finds an empty compartment which turns out to be Grant''s; while he is deciding what to do with her, the aircraft takes off. After she leaves, he informs a crewman he will pay her fare.
When Pryor tries to blackmail Costello, the latter bluffs him into leaving. Pryor then finds out that Jennie has some connection to the inspector; he poses as a police superintendent and learns from her her involvement in the murder. She remarks that a perpetrator could light a match singlehanded, something he saw Costello perform. He brings Jennie to Costello''s dinner table, but Costello appears unfazed.
Late that night, by chance, Jennie and Costello are alone in the lounge. He lures the unsuspecting young woman on the open-air balcony, intending to push her over, but Pryor is watching. Now in a stronger bargaining position, he demands not £1,000 but £20,000, this time for not interfering with Costello''s plan. Costello seemingly agrees and leads him into the baggage compartment for the money, but instead shoots him dead. There is an unseen witness, however: Arnold. He wakes Grant. Meanwhile, Costello tries to strangle Jennie. When Grant hears her screams, he bursts in, only to be held at gunpoint. Distracted by Arnold, Costello grabs a parachute, makes his way to the cockpit, locks the door, shoots the pilot and jumps out. With the aircraft out of control, Grant goes outside, makes his way over the fuselage clinging to a cable handrail to the cockpit, and unlocks the door for the other pilot, who regains control just in time. When Grant radios for a police cordon for Costello, Arnold sheepishly admits he used part of the parachute to muffle his saxophone.','["Robert Stevenson"]','["Ken Attiwill","Roland Pertwee"]','["John Loder","Anna Lee","Francis L.

To achieve this end, they interrogate a recently shot-down aircrew from a B-99 reconnaissance mission that was shot down over Italy. The aircrew is sent to Dulag Luft POW camp.
The German officers, commanded by Major von Behn (Carl Esmond) use various methods to discover this information, some of them quite subtle. While interviewing Lieutenant Frank L. Williams, Jr. (Don Porter) and Captain James Spencer (James Seay), the two airmen at first resist any probing for information. Other members of the crew include Sergeant Alfred Mason (Arthur Kennedy).
Though no physical brutality is used, the Germans at one point stage a mock execution to scare a prisoner. Another prisoner is subjected to isolation to heighten his fear. Red Cross officers and a nurse (Poldi Dur) use their positions to extract information from the prisoners. Each airman eventually provides useful information because of their arrogance, fear or naivety. Some of what they say, which the enemy finds useful, seems innocuous but is used by the Germans as pieces to solve the larger puzzle.
In the end, the Germans are able to determine the target of the raid and the B-99 bombing mission is intercepted. The intended target is spared heavy damage with 21 B-99s shot down and the loss of 105 aircrew. 
The U.S. intelligence officer (Lloyd Nolan), in his briefing to the surviving members of the raid, stresses not talking under any circumstances because of the danger of talking too much; even innocuous conversation can help the enemy. He also says not to let down one''s guard, that everything in a prison camp is suspect, and not to try to outwit the enemy.','["Bernard Vorhaus"]',NULL,'["Louis Adlon","Rand Brooks","Frederic Brunn"]','[""]','6.8','["tt0041963","tt0037136","tt0042832","tt0041378","tt0036823","tt0038192","tt0214483","tt0031755","tt0055261","tt0037610","tt0009026","tt0023125"]','["WWII","World War, 1939-1945 -- Psychological aspects","World War, 1939-1945 -- Prisoners and prisons, German","Training Film","World War II","World War, 1939-1945","Peter Van Eyck","Interrogation","Lloyd Nolan","Craig Stevens","POWs","United States.

('tt0025373','free','The Lawless Frontier (1934)','1934','59min','The movie opens with a family shooting from the window of their home, as they are robbed of their cattle. John Tobin (John Wayne) arrives home later that night and discovers his family killed and their cattle missing. Tobin sets out in search of Pandro Zanti (Earl Dwire), the local bandito, for all appearances a stereotypical Mexican outlaw, though the script is twice careful to tell us he is half white and half Apache and only pretends to be Mexican.
Zanti plans to kidnap Ruby (Sheila Terry) for his lusty needs. This is an unusual villainous trait for 1930s matinee Westerns, aimed at young audiences who expected villains to be claim jumpers and killers, not rapists. Ruby and her father, Dusty (George "Gabby" Hayes), hightail it out of there before she falls victim of the killer, escaping by a clever ruse (hiding in a large gunny sack) in which Ruby almost drowns in a river. Tobin, tracking his family''s killers, rescues the sack containing Ruby, and she, Dusty, and Tobin join forces.
Sheriff Luke Williams (Jack Rockwell) immediately takes credit for capturing Zanti when Tobin brings him in; he also arrests Tobin for the murder of Dusty, who took a knife in the back and collapsed. Later it is discovered Dusty only received a superficial wound and was knocked out. The sheriff, however, makes a series of mistakes, including handcuffing a bad guy''s boot to a bed, so that all he has to do is take off his boot to escape, especially when Tobin made of point of telling Williams that Zanti can probably get loose.
A chase across the desert, partly on foot, ensues, with Tobin going after Zanti. The villain drinks from a desert watering hole, but in his fatigued state he does not see the sign marked "Poison. Do not drink." He dies soon after. With the chief villain now out of the picture, there is more hard riding and shooting, as Ruby and Tobin flee from Zanti''s gang. When the happy ending finally arrives, Tobin becomes the new sheriff, replacing the inept Williams.','["Robert N.

('tt0043397','free','Chained for Life (1952)','1952','1h 21min','The movie opens with a judge (Norval Mitchell) begging the audience for help in resolving a terrible dilemma. The action moves to a courtroom, where Vivian Hamilton is on trial for the shooting death of her sister''s lover. The story unfolds in flashback as various characters are called to testify.
Conjoined twins Dorothy and Vivian Hamilton (Daisy and Violet Hilton) have a successful vaudeville singing act, but their manager Hinkley (Allen Jenkins) thinks a publicity stunt will reinvigorate their career. He pays stunt shooter Andre Pariseau (Mario Laval) to fake a romance with one of the twins. Vivian, the brunette, dislikes Andre and wants nothing to do with the scheme, but Dorothy, the blonde, quips that she is too old to turn down a chance at love, and agrees to serve as Andre''s love interest.
The ploy works, with "the girls" singing for standing room only crowds. But Dorothy actually falls in love with the scheming Andre, though he is secretly involved with his shooting-act partner, Renee (Patricia Wright).
Andre proposes marriage, but the couple is unable to obtain a marriage license due to allegations that the marriage would constitute bigamy. A desperate Dorothy convinces Vivian to seek separation surgery, even at the risk of their lives, so that she can pursue her dreams of love. Doctors, however, inform the women that such surgery is impossible. But, the doctors stress, there is no physical reason that Dorothy can not marry.
By consulting with a blind minister, Dorothy and Andre are able to obtain their marriage license. The wedding ceremony is performed on-stage before an audience of dignitaries including the mayor.
But the next day, Andre leaves Dorothy, claiming that he could not adjust to life as the husband of a conjoined twin. Vivian knows differently, because she has seen Andre and Renee kissing passionately and her suspicions of Andre are confirmed. Vivian is outraged that her sister was mistreated.
During Andre''s shooting performance, Vivian seizes one of Andre''s guns and shoots him dead before a horrified audience.

The film returns to the judge, who cannot decide how to dispose of the case. Justice for Andre requires that his murderer, Vivian, be executed. But this would cost the life of the innocent Dorothy. The film ends with a plea for the viewer to resolve the dilemma.','["Harry L.

Rather than finding a dour spinster, as he expects, she is a young blonde woman he finds attractive. Her interactions with him lead her to question her feminist convictions, such as it being unsuitable for a woman to illogically fall in love with someone she also loathes. The unbidden thoughts and impulses even invade her subconscious in a dream sequence.
It is a battle of the sexes, and the id and ego, as the two clash. Bill tries to show her that her book is "all rot"; Dorinda tries to prove her theories that love is just an autonomic function and not really worth it. They find that they all have a lot to learn, and forgive. It looks like sometimes the answer is "no", and sometimes "yes".
Mayhem follows, when her errant uncle returns, and they get pulled into the lives of the colorful local characters. A barroom brawl ensues when Bill rebuffs Dorinda''s attempts at seducing him and she proceeds to charm all the single men there. One of those men is a married man named Potsie. Goldie, his wife, confronts Dorinda in the powder room. Talking her way out of the fight, Dorinda asks Goldie if she would be better off without Potsie, and she says yes because she thinks he''s a jerk. 
There is a timeskip and Dorinda learns that Goldie has left Potsie, who''s gone to live with Bill in Bill''s trailer. Dorinda collects Goldie, who has practically memorized Dorinda''s book, and goes to find the men. When they won''t come out of the trailer, Dorinda steals Bill''s car and drags the trailer into the military base, leading to a high speed police pursuit. Still, Potsie won''t come out. A misunderstanding leads to the General being notified of a flying saucer report and coming to the trailer scene. He orders Potsie to exit and talk to his wife, with whom he reconciles after Dorinda tells Goldie that her book is stupid and that she''s sorry that she ever wrote it because Potsie and Goldie love each other and belong together in spite of the fighting.
Dorinda packs her bags and moves out of her aunt''s home while her aunt and uncle reconcile. She''s off in her car to find Bill and confess her feelings. Bill explains away the folly of her feminist views and her book as an obsession with sexual repression that appeals to the sexually repressed. Dorinda throws Goldie''s copy of her book into the ocean and resolves to write a book entitled 27 Ways to Say Yes.','["Frank Ross"]',NULL,'["Joan Caulfield","David Niven","James Robertson Justice"]','[""]','5.5','["tt0042182","tt0030261","tt0034540","tt0051773","tt0039787","tt0027515","tt0038592","tt0045921","tt0056044","tt0031282","tt0043618","tt0059905"]','[""]','[{"url":"/lady_says_no.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/lady_says_no_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/lady_says_no_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','lady_says_no',39923,'Q7745149','wp','["Robert Russell"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

His corrupt political boss, Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold), pressures Hopper to choose his handpicked stooge, while popular committees want a reformer, Henry Hill. The governor''s children want him to select Jefferson Smith (James Stewart), the head of the Boy Rangers. Unable to make up his mind between Taylor''s stooge and the reformer, Hopper decides to flip a coin. When it lands on edge – and next to a newspaper story on one of Smith''s accomplishments – he chooses Smith, calculating that his wholesome image will please the people while his naïveté will make him easy to manipulate.
Junior Senator Smith is taken under the wing of the publicly esteemed, but secretly crooked, Senator Joseph Paine (Claude Rains), who was Smith''s late father''s friend. Smith develops an immediate attraction to the senator''s daughter, Susan (Astrid Allwyn). At Senator Paine''s home, Smith has a conversation with Susan, fidgeting and bumbling, entranced by the young socialite. Smith''s naïve and honest nature allows the unforgiving Washington press to take advantage of him, quickly tarnishing Smith''s reputation with ridiculous front-page pictures and headlines branding him a bumpkin.
To keep Smith busy, Paine suggests he propose a bill. With the help of his secretary, Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur), who was the aide to Smith''s predecessor and had been around Washington and politics for years, Smith comes up with a bill to authorize a federal government loan to buy some land in his home state for a national boys'' camp, to be paid back by youngsters across America. Donations pour in immediately. However, the proposed campsite is already part of a dam-building graft scheme included in an appropriations bill framed by the Taylor political machine and supported by Senator Paine.
Unwilling to crucify the worshipful Smith so that their graft plan will go through, Paine tells Taylor he wants out, but Taylor reminds him that Paine is in power primarily through Taylor''s influence. Through Paine, the machine in his state accuses Smith of trying to profit from his bill by producing fraudulent evidence that Smith already owns the land in question. Smith is too shocked by Paine''s betrayal to defend himself and runs away.
Saunders, who looked down on Smith at first, but has come to believe in him, talks him into launching a filibuster to postpone the appropriations bill and prove his innocence on the Senate floor just before the vote to expel him. In his last chance to prove his innocence, he talks non-stop for about 25 hours, reaffirming the American ideals of freedom and disclosing the true motives of the dam scheme. Yet none of the Senators are convinced.
The constituents try to rally around him, but the entrenched opposition is too powerful, and all attempts are crushed. Owing to the influence of Taylor''s machine, newspapers and radio stations in Smith''s home state, on Taylor''s orders, refuse to report what Smith has to say and even distort the facts against the senator. An effort by the Boy Rangers to spread the news in support of Smith results in vicious attacks on the children by Taylor''s minions.
Although all hope seems lost, the senators begin to pay attention as Smith approaches utter exhaustion. Paine has one last card up his sleeve: he brings in bins of letters and telegrams from Smith''s home state, purportedly from average people demanding his expulsion. Nearly broken by the news, Smith finds a small ray of hope in a friendly smile from the President of the Senate (Harry Carey). Smith vows to press on until people believe him but immediately collapses in a faint. Overcome with guilt, Paine leaves the Senate chamber and attempts to commit suicide by gunshot, but is stopped by onlooking senators. He then bursts back into the Senate chamber, shouting a confession to the whole scheme; Paine further insists that he should be expelled from the Senate and affirms Smith''s innocence, to the delight of Clarissa. The President of the Senate observes the ensuing chaos with amusement.','["Frank Capra"]','["Sidney Buchman","Lewis R.

Her husband, Gus Hillman, a wealthy businessman, would be willing to contribute half a million dollars as capital for the venture.
Doris quickly seems interested in more than a purely professional relationship. Shaw starts an affair with her and accepts the business offer. However, an accidental discovery leaves him convinced that the Hillmans'' interest lies less in the long-term profits of the venture than in the $175,000 key man insurance policy he took on himself as a precondition for the deal, and that an attempt on his life is imminent.
Madge, the younger sister of Doris, develops a romantic interest in Shaw as well. Without knowing what Doris has planned, she reveals to Shaw that her sister was married previously to a man who died in Wyoming when his car crashed over a bridge. Shaw ends up drugged by Gus Hillman and barely keeps his car from going off a cliff.
The police are skeptical about his story and the insurance company refuses to cancel the policy, Hillman having portrayed Shaw as a man who is trying to steal his wife. Madge teams with Shaw to try to foil her sister''s scheme, but Doris lures him to a mountain cabin and shoots him with a gun. A wounded Shaw sees both Hillmans struggle then fall to their deaths through a clifftop doorway, just minutes before Madge and the cops arrive.','["Paul Guilfoyle"]','["Russ Bender","Hank McCune"]','["Angela Lansbury","Keith Andes","Douglass Dumbrille"]','["Drama","Film-Noir"]','5.8','["tt0042707","tt0049621","tt0043142","tt0040472","tt0048412","tt0039730","tt0038346","tt0047877","tt0040779","tt0043390","tt0049629","tt0041187"]',NULL,'[{"url":"/life_at_stake.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/life_at_stake_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/life_at_stake_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','life_at_stake',39064,'Q3819836','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Instead of playing at concerts he becomes a music teacher. He favors his student Dickie Morley''s (Matthew "Stymie" Beard) classical musical preferences over his own son John''s (William Washington), which tends towards modern swing.
Arthur''s daughter Grace (Sybil Lewis) is romantically interested in a man named Gus (Pete Webster), and they both work for the same company that makes hair products, which is owned by a James Stilton. Stilton''s son, Sam (Edward Thompson), has a thing for grace and is jealous of the attention she gives Gus. As a result, Sam refuses to give Grace an advance when she needs to pay for her father''s appointment at a doctor that specializes in neurology, Dr. Charles Matson (Jess Lee Brooks). The doctor promises Grace that she can pay the fee of $1,000 later, when her brother John has raised the money.
Sam goes on to frame Gus for something he didn''t do, and when Gus finds out, both he and Grace quit their jobs at the Stilton company. Fortunately, Johnny is a big success at the Miller Café when he is playing swing.
Arthur is mad and chastizes his son for playing such, in his view, awful music, and punishes him by making him play the violin until he faints. Soon after, Grace tells her father that Johnny only played at the club so that they could pay for the neurologist and support themselves since she is currently between jobs. Arthur feels guilt over how he treated his son.
Johnny and Grace go on to enter a music contest broadcast on the radio. At first it looks like their performance will be stopped when two strings on his violin, but then he gets the idea to play swing, since there are enough strings for that. The rest of the radio musicians all start playing the same way, and the performance is a success. When his son wins the contest, Arthur realizes his talent, and starts to regain sensitivity enough in his fingers to applause his son. Later it turns out that Dickie had sabotaged the violin before the contest, for which he apologizes. Arthur continues his career as a violinist.','["Bernard B. Ray"]','["Bernard B.

Margaret insists they are lost, and Michael claims they are not. They are then pulled over by a local deputy for a broken taillight, but are let go after Michael asks him for mercy since they are on their "first vacation". After long shots of driving through farmland and the desert, intercut with scenes of two teenagers making out in a car and being caught by the deputies, the family finally reach a house, tended by the bizarre, satyr-like Torgo, who says he takes care of the place "while The Master is away". The house seemed to appear out of nowhere, and Torgo acts very strange. Apprehensive, Michael and Margaret ask Torgo for directions to the Valley Lodge; Torgo denies having knowledge of such a place. Frustrated, Michael asks Torgo to let him and his family stay the night, despite objections from both Torgo and Margaret.
Inside the house, Michael and Margaret find a disturbing painting of a dark, malevolent-looking man and a black dog with glowing eyes; Torgo says the man it depicts is The Master. Margaret becomes frightened upon hearing an ominous howl; Peppy breaks away from Debbie and runs outside after the howl. Michael investigates, retrieving a flashlight and revolver from his car, and finds Peppy lying dead on the ground. Michael buries the dog in the desert, and goes back to the house. Meanwhile, Torgo reveals his sudden attraction to Margaret and tells her that although The Master wants her to become his bride, he intends to keep her for himself. Torgo then spends the next few minutes trying to grope her shoulder. Margaret threatens to tell Michael of Torgo''s advances, but Torgo convinces her not to say anything by promising to protect her. Michael returns and is unable to start the car. Torgo tells them there is no phone in the house, so the family reluctantly decides to stay the night.
After another scene of Torgo peeping in on Margaret changing clothes, Michael and Margaret find Debbie is gone and go to look for her. Debbie returns, holding the leash of a big black dog, the same dog from the painting. Following Debbie, Michael and Margaret stumble upon The Master and his wives, sleeping around a blazing fire. The wives are dressed in diaphanous nightgowns, The Master in a robe with two red hands on it. Margaret and Debbie run back to the house to get their things and escape. As Michael runs behind them, Torgo appears and uses a stick to knock him out and then ties him to a pole. The Master awakens and summons his wives, telling them that Michael must be sacrificed to the deity Manos, and Margaret and Debbie will become his new wives. He then leaves.
The other wives argue among each other about whether Debbie should become a wife or be sacrificed as well. This turns into a catfight, where the wives tumble around in the dirt. The Master returns and breaks up the fight, and decides to sacrifice Torgo and his first wife instead. Meanwhile, Michael wakes up and unties himself, going back to the house to collect Margaret and Debbie. The family leaves the house and runs off into the desert to escape. The Master summons Torgo and hypnotizes him, ordering the wives to kill him. Two of the wives attempt to kill Torgo by slapping and lightly shaking him, until he falls to the ground, apparently dead. However, he then regains consciousness and stands up; the Master then severs and burns Torgo''s left hand. Torgo runs off into the darkness with his stump of a wrist in flames, and The Master then sacrifices his first wife.
As Michael, Margaret and Debbie run through the desert, Margaret falls and says she can''t go any farther. Stock footage of a rattlesnake is shown to appear in front of them and Michael shoots it, the noise attracting the attention of the deputies, who think the noises come from Mexico and leave it at that. Margaret convinces Michael to return to the house, as the cult would never think to look for them there. They go back and find The Master and his dog waiting for them. As The Master comes toward them, Michael fires several shots into The Master''s face at point-blank range, but they have no effect.
The film then cuts to another pair of travelers, two women starting their vacation. They drive through a rainstorm, searching for a place to stay. After more driving they end up at The Master''s house. An entranced Michael greets them, telling them "I take care of the place while The Master is away." The ending scene shows Margaret and Debbie have become wives of The Master, and all are asleep.','["Harold P.

Because of war time restrictions, the name of the aircraft carrier was disguised as "the Fighting Lady", although she was later identified as USS Yorktown (CV-10). ("Fighting Lady" was the known moniker of the Yorktown, just as "Lady Lex" for Lexington, "The Big E" for Enterprise, etc...) A few shots of aircraft landing were filmed aboard the Yorktown''s sister ship USS Ticonderoga.
Frequently mentioned is the  adage that war is 99% waiting.  The first half or so of the film is taken up with examining the mundane details of life on board the aircraft carrier as she sails through the Panama Canal and into the Pacific Ocean, finally seeing action at Marcus Island (attacked in 1943). The film provides aerial views of a series of airstrikes at Japanese bases in the Pacific theatre.
Following an attack on Kwajalein in early 1944, intelligence reports that an armada of Japanese ships is massing near Truk, a major Japanese logistical base in the Carolines. The Fighting Lady and some of her task force are sent on a "hit and run" mission to neutralize it and return to Marcus, but not to attempt a landing.
Once the ship returns from the massive, two-day Truk raid, it is then sent to the waters off the Marianas and participates in the famous "Marianas Turkey Shoot".

He sees a doctor, Sir James Aldroyd, who bluntly informs him that he is suffering from too much money, that if he would be cured if he lived for a year on a few pounds per week. Bliss is so insulted that he makes a bet for £50,000 with Sir James that he can survive for a year, supporting himself solely on whatever he earns and not touching his inherited millions.
He takes the Underground to Stepney Green and rents an attic room. He falls behind on the rent, but landlady Mrs. Heath is sympathetic to his plight.
Finally, despite having no experience, he persuades Mr. Masters to give him a job selling Alpha stoves. After three weeks, he has not made a single sale, and Frances Clayton (Mary Brian), Masters'' secretary, tells Bliss that the company, in which Masters has invested his life savings, is in danger of closing down. Then Bliss comes up with an idea to promote the product. He takes £500 of his own money - but not for his own benefit, so the bet is still on - and offers free meals cooked on the stoves to the general public. A wholesale buyer places a trial order for 100 stoves, with the prospect of purchasing 40,000 a year if things work out. Masters is delighted and offers Bliss a partnership, but Bliss instead resigns.
After he finds another job, Bliss takes Frances to dinner. As they dance, she informs him that she too is leaving Masters; he offered her a partnership too, but of the matrimonial kind.
Late one night, Dr. Alroyd engages a car and a chauffeur for a medical emergency. That chauffeur turns out to be Bliss. After Bliss drives the doctor back to Harley Street, Bliss informs him that almost seven months have elapsed on their bet.
Dorrington, another customer, asks him to come to 11 Regents Park Gate, flat 6, which happens to be Bliss''s place. Bliss''s valet Clowes, with too much time on his hands, lost heavily betting on the dogs and let the flat to Dorrington. Dorrington has noticed the "resemblance" between the chauffeur and the absent owner. Dorrington has practiced forging Bliss''s signature and wants the chauffeur to cash a cheque for £30,000 in return for a third share. Bliss gets the cashier to give him blank pieces of paper in an envelope and returns to his flat. He reveals who he is to Dorrington and his henchman, but they do not believe him. In the ensuing fight, Dorrington slips away with the worthless envelope while Bliss struggles with the henchman. Finally a drunk Clowes emerges and hits the henchman with a bottle. Afterward, Bliss forgives his servant.
Frances gets a job with Mr. Montague; he makes it clear that he wants more than a secretary, but she needs the work. When she tells Bliss that Montague wants her to do some work outside the office at night, Bliss disables Montague''s car and has her hire him to take them to Montague''s rendezvous. After confirming that Montague''s intentions are not honourable, he takes Frances away. When his boss sacks him, he is unconcerned, but then the manager discharges mechanic Bill Bronson for standing up for him, so Bliss buys the company and orders that the manager be fired and replaced by Bill.
He persuades Frances to accept his marriage proposal. Then her mother arrives with terrible news; Frances''s sister will die unless she is taken to a winter resort in Switzerland. In desperation, Frances decides to marry Masters for the money she needs. She moves without informing Bliss. He finally tracks her down and, after learning why she broke up with him, fixes everything and marries her himself.','["Alfred Zeisler"]','["E. Phillips Oppenheim","John L.

The bus stops in the town of Hillside, where Muggs and his pals flirt with Margie, a soda fountain waitress (Rosemary Portia). While they are there, a radio broadcast announces that a maniacal "monster killer" is in the area. When they arrive at the camp, the counselor, Jeff Dixon (Dave O''Brien), complains to his girlfriend, camp nurse Linda Mason (Dorothy Short), that he will get no work done on his thesis because of the rowdy juvenile delinquents.
One night, Nardo (Bela Lugosi), a mysterious caped figure, and his dwarf assistant, Luigi (Angelo Rossitto), ask a local gas station attendant for directions to the hilltop Billings house, which has been deserted for years since its owner was murdered. After he leaves, another car arrives and the attendant recognizes the driver from his mystery magazines as Dr. Von Grosch (Dennis Moore). The attendant believes that Nardo is the killer and Von Grosch is hunting him, and he alerts the local constable that Nardo is a suspect. One night, Nardo and Luigi sneak into the local graveyard and are shot at by a grave digger.
That same night, Muggs slips out of camp hoping to rendezvous with the soda fountain girl, and is followed by all his pals. The East Side Kids get lost in the woods, and when they wander into the graveyard, Peewee is also shot by the digger. The boys take Peewee to the nearby Billings house, where Nardo tends to his minor injury and gives him a sedative. Nardo lets the boys spend the night, but Peewee disappears while sleepwalking. The rest of the boys are unable to sleep because of Nardo''s strangeness and Peewee''s disappearance. Linda, meanwhile, also disappears while out searching for the boys, and Jeff goes to the police for help.
When the boys confront Nardo, he claims not to know where Peewee is, but insists that the boys remain in the house. Muggs distrusts Nardo and on his command, the boys attack him and roll him into a carpet. Skinny and Glimpy disappear through a secret passage, and Scruno is spooked when Nardo reappears. At constable Jim''s office, the grave digger recalls seeing the boys, and Jim believes they may have fallen into the killer''s hands at the Billings estate. The boys, meanwhile, search for Peewee, but are continually being surprised by the appearance of coffins and objects that move themselves, and by the disappearance of their pals through walls and closets.
Linda, meanwhile, accepts a ride from Von Grosch, who takes her to the Billings house, ostensibly to help the boys. Muggs and the boys succeed in terrifying Nardo by pretending to be a ghost, and they finally find Peewee back in bed. Just after Linda and Von Grosch arrive at the house, Von Grosch attacks Linda.
The police burst in and accuse Nardo of being a killer, but Muggs has already learned that Nardo is merely a magician. When they all hear Linda screaming inside a locked room, Muggs climbs onto the roof and enters the room through a window. While he struggles with Von Grosch, who is the real "monster killer," Linda opens the door, and the police arrest Von Grosch. Later, Nardo performs magic tricks for Jeff, Linda and the boys, and when Muggs goes into a cabinet after a disappearing girl, he emerges with Scruno in his arms.','["Phil Rosen"]','["Carl Foreman","Charles R.

('tt0033891','free','Meet John Doe (1941)','1941','2h 2min','Infuriated at being told to write one final column after being laid off from her newspaper job, Ann Mitchell prints a letter from a fictional unemployed "John Doe" threatening suicide on Christmas Eve in protest of society''s ills. When the letter causes a sensation among readers, and the paper''s competition suspects a fraud and starts to investigate, editor Henry Connell is persuaded to rehire Ann, who schemes to boost the newspaper''s sales by exploiting the fictional John Doe. From a number of derelicts who show up at the paper claiming to have written the original letter, Ann and Henry hire John Willoughby, a former baseball player and tramp in need of money to repair his injured arm, to play the role of John Doe. Ann starts to pen a series of articles in Doe''s name, elaborating on the original letter''s ideas of society''s disregard for people in need.
Willoughby gets $50, a new suit of clothes, and a plush hotel suite with his tramp friend "The Colonel", who launches into an extended diatribe against "the heelots", lots of heels who incessantly focus on getting money from others. Proposing to take Doe national via the radio, Ann is given $100 a week by the newspaper''s publisher, D. B. Norton, to write radio speeches for Willoughby. Meanwhile, John is offered a $5,000 bribe from a rival newspaper to admit the whole thing was a publicity stunt, but ultimately turns it down and delivers the speech Ann has written for him instead. Afterward, feeling conflicted, he runs away, riding the rails with the Colonel until they reach Millsville. "John Doe" is recognized at a diner and brought to City Hall, where he''s met by Bert Hanson, who explains how he was inspired by Doe''s words to start a "John Doe club" with his neighbors.
The John Doe philosophy spreads across the country, developing into a broad grassroots movement whose simple slogan is, "Be a better neighbor". However, Norton secretly plans to channel support for Doe into support for his own national political ambitions. When a John Doe rally is scheduled, with John Doe clubs from throughout the country in attendance, Norton instructs Mitchell to write a speech for Willoughby in which he announces the foundation of a new political party and endorses Norton as its presidential candidate. On the night of the rally, John, who has come to believe in the John Doe philosophy himself, learns of Norton''s treachery from a drunken Henry. He denounces Norton and tries to expose the plot at the rally, but Norton speaks first, exposing Doe as a fake and claiming to have been deceived, like everyone else, by the staff of the newspaper. Despondent at letting his now-angry followers down, John plans to commit suicide by jumping from the roof of the City Hall on Christmas Eve, as indicated in the original John Doe letter. Ann, who has fallen in love with John, desperately tries to talk him out of jumping (saying that another John Doe, has already died for the sake of humanity), and Hanson and his neighbors tell him of their plan to restart their John Doe club. Convinced not to kill himself, John leaves, carrying a fainted Ann in his arms, and Henry turns to Norton and says, "There you are, Norton! The people!

Drawn and Quartered (Tales from the Crypt #26)
Moore is an impoverished painter living in Haiti. When he learns that his paintings have been sold for high prices by art dealers Diltant and Gaskill after being praised by critic Fenton Breedley, all of whom told him that they were worthless, he goes to a voodoo priest and his painting hand is given voodoo power; whatever he paints or draws can be harmed by damaging its image. Rather awkwardly, these events coincide with his completing a self-portrait, which he keeps under lock and key to prevent the magic from turning on him. Returning to London, Moore paints portraits of the three men who cheated him, and mutilates the paintings to exact his revenge. He is also obliged to put his own portrait out in the open, because leaving it in an airless strongbox nearly suffocated him. A workman subsequently drops a can of paint thinner on the picture through a skylight, and Moore, as a result of the voodoo, suffers a correspondingly messy death.
When the story of the final dream is told, the five ponder the meaning of their nightmares. The lift door opens, and they find themselves looking out onto a graveyard. Rodgers, Critchit, Maitland, and Moore walk out into the graveyard and disappear one by one. Sebastian remains behind and explains that they are all damned souls compelled to tell the stories of their evil deeds for all eternity. He then turns back into the room, which is now a mausoleum, walks towards the casket and disappears himself. Then the door slams shut.','["Roy Ward Baker"]','["Al Feldstein","William M.

Pulling off the blindfold, the first thing he sees is a sculpture high on his building which he takes to be an angel, and he assumes he is in Heaven. However a jazz band on an adjacent rooftop garden soon disabuses him of that notion, and he realises he is high above the city.
After several perilous escapades high on the construction site, he finally makes it to the ground, only to realise that the man Mildred was talking to was her clergyman brother, who has agreed to officiate at their wedding.','["Fred C.

Soon the vehicle gets hopelessly stuck in deep snow forty miles from the nearest town.  Needing shelter, the driver "Gus" (Billy Bevan) and his four passengers find refuge in an isolated one-room log church.  The passengers include "Billie" (Carole Lombard), who is an escaped criminal being escorted back to jail in New York by a deputy sheriff, "Dan Egan" (Owen Moore); a young woman, "The Kid," (Diane Ellis) on her way to Chicago to meet her boyfriend; and "Hickerson," a pompous, ill-tempered banker.  In the church the group finds "Bill" (William Boyd), a self-described "hobo," who had found shelter there earlier.  Tensions quickly arise in the group over their general plight, petty jealousies, and concerns about how six people are going to share the small supply of food that Bill had brought with him.
After a few days being stranded, the group sees a passing mail plane high in the sky.  They try to attract the pilot''s attention, but he is too far away to see them.  More days pass, and the group continues to ration their dwindling supplies and battle the subfreezing temperatures. To keep warm they begin to break up the church''s pews and other furnishings to use as firewood in the room''s potbelly stove. The group''s desperation intensifies, as does a romance between Bill and Billie.  Soon Bill confides to her that he too is a wanted criminal, a fugitive from Saint Paul, Minnesota.  As conditions worsen, The Kid collapses from hunger and become delirious; and the church''s interior becomes almost bare as more furnishings—even the church''s pulpit and pump organ—are consigned to the stove.  Bill and Billie finally commit to leaving to avoid being imprisoned if the group is somehow rescued. They quietly depart during the night, hoping to reach a ranger station ten miles away.  Everyone else is sleeping except Dan, the deputy sheriff, who sees the two leaving; but he does nothing to stop them.  After walking a short distance through snowdrifts, Bill and Billie hear and then see a search plane slowly circling overhead at low altitude.  Realizing that the others inside the church will not hear the plane''s engine, they rush back and awaken them.  The group hurriedly builds a signal fire, which the plane''s pilot sees.  He parachutes a box of provisions to them with a note saying that help will be sent immediately.
The next day the group sees a rescue party heading toward the church.  While awaiting their rescuers, Dan observes Bill and Billie sitting together on the floor.  From his coat pocket Dan pulls out Billie''s extradition papers and a "wanted" notice that includes a photograph of Bill and information about his being a fugitive from Saint Paul.  Dan walks over to the stove, now cold from no fires, and tosses both papers into it.  Bill and Billie see him discard the papers, and they look at one another.  Bill then gets up, retrieves the papers from the stove, gives them back to Dan, and asks him to drop him off in Saint Paul on his way back to New York with Billie.','["Howard Higgin"]','["Elliott J.

('tt0047947','free','Conquest of Space (1955)','1955','1h 21min','Mankind has achieved space flight capability and built "The Wheel" space station in orbit 1,075 miles above Earth. It is commanded by its designer, Colonel Samuel T. Merritt (Walter Brooke). His son, Captain Barney Merritt (Eric Fleming), having been aboard for a year, wants to return to Earth.
A giant spaceship has been built in a nearby orbit, and an Earth inspector arrives aboard the station with new orders: Merritt is being promoted to general and will command the new spaceship, now being sent to Mars instead of the Moon. As General Merritt considers his crew of three enlisted men and one officer, his close friend, Sgt. Mahoney (Mickey Shaughnessy) volunteers. The general turns him down for being 20 years too old. Hearing that Mars is the new destination, Barney Merritt volunteers to be the second officer.
Right after the crew watches a TV broadcast from their family and friends, the mission blasts off for the Red Planet. The general''s undiagnosed and growing space fatigue is beginning to seriously affect his judgement: Reading his Bible frequently, he has doubts about the righteousness of the mission. After launch, Sgt. Mahoney is discovered to be a stowaway, having hidden in a crew spacesuit. Their piloting radar antenna later fails, and two crewmen  go outside to make repairs. They manage to get it working just as their monitors show a glowing planetoid, 20 times larger than their spaceship, coming at them from astern. The general fires the engines, barely managing to avoid a collision, but the planetoid''s fast-orbiting debris punctures Sgt. Fodor (Ross Martin)''s spacesuit, killing him instantly. After a religious service in space, Fodor''s body is cast adrift into the void.
Eight months later, the general is becoming increasingly mentally unbalanced, focusing on Sgt. Fodor''s loss as "God''s judgement". On the Mars landing approach, he attempts to crash their spaceship, now convinced the mission violates the laws of God. Barney wrests control away from his father, landing the large flying wing glider-rocket safely. Later, as the crew takes their first steps on the Red Planet, they look up and see water pouring down from the now vertical return rocket. Barney quickly discovers the leak is sabotage caused by his father, who threatens his son with a .45 automatic. The two struggle and the pistol discharges, killing the general. Sgt. Mahoney, who observed only the last stages of the struggle, wants Barney confined under arrest with the threat of court martial, but cooler heads prevail; Barney becomes the ranking officer.
Mars proves to be inhospitable, and they struggle to survive with their decreased water supply. Earth''s correct orbital position for a return trip is one year away. While glumly celebrating their first Christmas on Mars, a sudden snowstorm blows in, allowing them to replenish their water supply. As their launch window arrives, they hear low rumbling sounds, then see rocks falling, and feel the ground shake violently. The ground level shifts during this violent marsquake. Their spaceship is now leaning at a precarious angle and cannot make an emergency blast off. To right the spaceship, the crew uses the rocket engines'' powerful thrust to shift the ground under the landing legs. The attempt works and they blast off, the spaceship rising just as the Martian surface completely collapses.
Once in space, Barney and Mahoney reconcile. Impressed with Barney''s heroism and leadership while on Mars, Mahoney concludes that pursuing Barney''s court martial for his father''s death would only impugn the general''s reputation, tarnishing what previously had been a spotless military career. Better is the fiction that "the man who conquered space" died in the line of duty, sacrificing himself to save his crew.','["Byron Haskin"]','["Chesley Bonestell","Willy Ley"]','["Walter Brooke","Eric Fleming","Mickey Shaughnessy"]','["Sci-Fi"]','5.7','["tt0049169","tt0042393","tt0042897","tt0044207","tt0047577","tt0058530","tt0064519","tt0051786","tt0049967","tt0050085","tt0050610","tt0051484"]','[""]','[{"url":"/conquest_of_space_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/conquest_of_space_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','conquest_of_space',12820,'Q12109285','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Frankie is an impoverished child of a kindly mother and an alcoholic father who spends what little income the family receives on drink.  He is about to graduate from school and his family cannot afford to clothe him on this occasion. His teacher, Miss Williams, asks him to participate with the class in a performance in front of the school inspector.  While others in the class have academic prowess, he plays the harmonica for him.  Unfortunately the instrument is not his, as he noticed it in a shop window the previous night.  He stole the harmonica along with some money, and the sheriff arrived just after the performance to interrogate him about the crime.  Although his teacher and the sheriff are sympathetic to Frankie''s situation, the severity of the crime means that he has to be sent to reform school.
He gains a tough reputation there and afterwards is sent to the state penitentiary for five years for punching a prison monitor. After this time he is released as an adult with two other inmates, and they spend their first evening of freedom together. Later they go with Frankie back to his home town.  It happens to be Miss Williams'' birthday, and she is opening cards and presents sent by her former pupils, including Frankie. Although she has fond thoughts of all her students, she said to her friends that she cared for Frankie as if he were her own.
Things have changed since Frankie left the town. He returns to his family shack, to find that a black woman and her children are now living there. She tells Frankie that his father had died and that his mother was taken away to an asylum a year previously. He meets Miss Williams and discovers that she has been pensioned off.  He visits the chairman of the school board of governors, who happens to be both an old school colleague and the local bank manager. He asks him to find a position for Miss Williams in the new school, and agrees to consider it.  The visiting trio then leave the town for Cleveland.
Frankie meets up with another classmate Carol and forms a relationship with her. Upon returning to his digs, he finds a note from his two friends saying that they intended to rob an ice cream parlour at a given time. He races to the scene in order to prevent the crime, but arrives just as they kill the proprietor.  He is implicated in and arrested for the crime. During the trial, Frankie is defended by another classmate, John Shelley (Van Heflin). While inexperienced as a lawyer, he delivers a powerful oration to the jury.

Frankie escapes from jail and manages to attend the reunion for a few moments.

('tt0081059','free','Lion of the Desert (1980)','1980','2h 53min','In 1929, Italian Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini (Rod Steiger) is still faced with the 20-year-long war waged by patriots in the Italian colony of Libya to combat Italian colonization and the establishment of "The Fourth Shore"—the rebirth of a Roman Empire in Africa. Mussolini appoints General Rodolfo Graziani (Oliver Reed) as his sixth governor to Libya, confident that the eminently accredited soldier and fascist Grande can crush the rebellion and restore the dissipated glories of Imperial Rome. Omar Mukhtar (Anthony Quinn) leads the resistance to the fascists. A teacher by profession, guerrilla by obligation, Mukhtar had committed himself to a war that cannot be won in his own lifetime. Graziani controls Libya with the might of the Regio Esercito (Italian Royal Army). Tanks and aircraft are used in the desert for the first time. The Italians also committed atrocities: killing of prisoners of war, destruction of crops, and imprisoning populations in concentration camps behind barbed wire.
The film starts by introducing the audience to the historical context of the film. This introductory scene is part of historic records that show us the rise of fascism in Italy, and how it impacted Libya tragically. The scene concludes by telling us that the characters and the events in this film are real and based on historical facts. The first scene after the introduction starts with Mussolini in Italy, who created the Fascist Party in Italy, complaining about his generals’ defeats in Italy. In order to crush the Libyan revolution after twenty years of failure, and after losing five of the best Italian generals, Mussolini sends his most skillful general, Graziani, to Libya. This scene is then contrasted with a scene of Omar Al-Mokhtar, the old teacher who turned into a fighting rebel during the Italian colonization, teaching his young students in Libya. Graziani goes to Libya and starts his campaign to crush the revolution. The Libyans show great resistance and make enormous sacrifices to defend their country. 
Despite their bravery, the Libyan Arabs and Berbers suffered heavy losses, their relatively primitive weaponry was no match for mechanised warfare; despite all this, they continued to fight, and managed to keep the Italians from achieving complete victory for 20 years. Graziani was only able to achieve victory through deceit, deception, violation of the laws of war and human rights, and by the use of tanks and aircraft.
Omar Al-Mokhtar shows great resistance and wisdom in leading the resistance movement. He enters into negotiations with the Italians to liberate Libya, but never reaches a deal with them because they pretend that they want to negotiate only to win time. They ask him for significant concessions and promise him some materialistic rewards to end the resistance movement, but Al-Mukhtar never accepts any of that, even after they captured him. They hang him in public to show the Libyans that resisting them is useless, but the resistance does not stop with his death. 
Despite their lack of modern weaponry, Graziani recognised the skill of his adversary in waging guerrilla warfare. In one scene, Mukhtar refuses to kill a defenseless young officer, instead giving him the Italian flag to return with. Mukhtar says that Islam forbids him to kill captured soldiers and demands that he only fight for his homeland, and that Muslims are taught to hate war itself.
In the end, Mukhtar is captured and tried as a rebel. His lawyer,  Captain Lontano, states that since Mukhtar had never accepted Italian rule, he cannot be tried as a rebel, and instead must be treated as a prisoner of war (which would save him from being hanged). The judge rejects this, and the film ends with Mukthar being publicly executed by hanging.','["Moustapha Akkad"]','["David Butler","H.A.L.

Wilson releases Kindler''s former associate Meinike, hoping the man will lead him to Kindler. Wilson follows Meinike to the United States, to the town of Harper, Connecticut, but loses him before he meets with Kindler. Kindler has assumed a new identity and is known locally as "Charles Rankin," and has become a prep school teacher. He is about to marry Mary Longstreet, daughter of Supreme Court Justice Adam Longstreet, and is involved in repairing the town''s 400-year-old Habrecht-style clock mechanism with religious automata that crowns the belfry of a church in the town square.
When Kindler and Meinike do meet, Meinike, who is repentant, begs Kindler to confess his crimes. Instead, Kindler strangles Meinike, who might expose him. Eventually, Wilson deduces that Rankin is Kindler, but not having witnessed the meeting with Meinike, he has no proof. Only Mary knows that Meinike came to meet her husband. To get her to admit this, Wilson must convince her that her husband is a criminal—before Rankin decides to eliminate the threat to him by killing her. Kindler''s pose begins to unravel when Red, the family dog, discovers Meinike''s body. To further protect his secret, Kindler poisons Red.
Meanwhile, Mary begins to suspect her husband is not being honest with her. She is torn between her desire to learn the truth concerning her husband as a possible murderous monster and the idea of helping him create his new life. Mr. Wilson shows her graphic footage of Nazi concentration camps and explains how Kindler developed the idea of genocide. Not until Mary discovers Kindler''s plot to kill her does she finally accept the truth. She dares her husband to kill her. Kindler tries, but he is prevented by Wilson and his brother-in-law Noah. Kindler then flees into the church belfry, to hide and finish fixing the clock mechanism needed to operate the bell. Shortly afterwards Mary confronts him and a struggle between the two ensues, during this time the clock bell begins to chime, bringing most of the town to the foot of the building. Wilson climbs up to the top of the tower where he too confronts Kindler, and grabs the gun which Mary had managed to dislodge. Kindler is then shot and staggers out of the belfry and onto the clock face, where he is impaled by the clock mechanism he labored to repair, and falls to his death.','["Orson Welles"]','["Anthony Veiller","Victor Trivas"]','["Orson Welles","Edward G.

Others call the police, reporting a murdered woman.
Henry gets picked up by the police and kept for interrogation until the wee hours of the morning; but his troubles are just starting. Effie has overheard the gossip spread amongst her party guests; and seeing Henry come home with one of the mannequin''s shoes and blonde hair on his clothes fears the worst. She is urged on by her friend, Grace Norman (Esther Muir) and an unscrupulous lawyer, Gilbert Wayne (Gayne Whitman) to file for a divorce. Henry and Effie both have their own lawyers who advise that since neither one will leave the family home they need witnesses that the couple are living apart to facilitate the divorce proceedings, and due to Henry''s alleged violent temper Effie''s lawyer also demands she have a bodyguard, a thug named Gooch who stays at the home.
When Effie decides to stop the divorce, a little scene staged by the lawyer, with his girlfriend, Nan, posing as the blonde Henry was supposedly seeing, convinces her otherwise. It is only then that the live in witnesses, her niece Jane Luana Walters and Henry''s friend Bob Grant, Bob Byrd notice that the shoe Henry brought back that night is about a size four; too small for Nan.

Modiste Lucille (Jean Parker) is introduced to Gaston Morrell (John Carradine), a puppeteer and painter, by her friend. They are attracted to each other, and she accepts a commission to design some costumes for his puppets.
At home, Morrell is confronted by a jealous Renee (Sonia Sorel), who performs in Morrell''s puppet show and is his lover. When she wonders what became of the models who had posed for him, he strangles her, then dumps her body in the Seine River.
Art dealer Jean Lamarte (Ludwig Stössel) is aware of Morrell''s homicidal tendencies, but keeps his secret, as Morrell''s paintings fetch high prices. However, the normally discreet Lamarte makes a mistake in selling Morrell''s last work to a duke. When the duke exhibits his collection, a policeman on guard recognizes the portrait as being that of one of Bluebeard''s victims.
Inspector Lefevre (Nils Asther) of the Sûreté calls in one of his best undercover agents, Francine (Teala Loring), who happens to be Lucille''s sister. She and her "father" go to Lamarte to have her portrait done. Lamarte is on his guard, but her father is willing to pay a very large commission to find the man responsible for the duke''s painting, and Lamarte''s greed overcomes his caution.
Morrell has decided to give up painting (which triggers his murderous compulsion) out of love for Lucille, but Lamarte pressures him into one last picture to make him financially independent. However, Francine recognizes him, having met him briefly earlier at her sister''s apartment, and Morrell has no choice but to dispose of her. Certain that Francine and her father were working for the police, Lamarte tries to flee, but Morrell catches him and kills him too, before escaping. The only clue he leaves behind is the cravat he used to strangle Francine.
At Francine''s funeral, Inspector Lefevre shows Lucille the cravat. She knows it belongs to Morrell, as she had mended it for him. When she confronts Morrell, he tells her the story behind his crimes. As a starving art student, he had nursed back to health a woman who had fainted, fallen in love with her, and painted her portrait. She left without warning. When his painting was chosen to hang in the Louvre, he searched for her to tell her the news, only to discover that she was a prostitute. Enraged by her contemptuous response, he strangled her. But ever since then, every model he painted turned into her in his mind, and he was compelled to kill her again and again. When Lucille tells him she is going to the authorities, he starts strangling her too, but the police break in. Lefevre saw that Lucille recognized the cravat and had her followed. After a chase across the rooftops, Morrell falls to his death into the Seine.','["Edgar G. Ulmer"]','["Arnold Lipp","Werner H.

Yvonne goes to Paul''s father for money, but is refused.  Orlac himself then goes to see his father, but finds he has been stabbed to death with the same knife like Vasseur''s. He starts to think he himself committed the murder, and goes to a café for a drink.  There he meets a man who claims he is Vasseur, who tells Orlac the same surgeon who did the hand transplant also transplanted a new head onto Vasseur''s body.   He then tells Orlac he wants money to keep quiet about the murder.
In the meantime, police find Vasseur''s finger prints at the scene of the crime, causing confusion.  Paul and Yvonne Orlac decide to go to the police and try to explain about Vasseur''s hands being on Paul''s arms, but that he had no recollection of killing his father.  He also tells the police about the man claiming to be the executed murderer, and the blackmail money.  It turns out that the man is actually a con man, well known to police.  Orlac''s maid tells the police that he was a friend of Vasseur, and that he had made a set of rubber gloves with Vasseur''s fingerprints.  The gloves were used during the murder.','["Robert Wiene"]','["Louis Nerz","Maurice Renard"]','["Conrad Veidt","Alexandra Sorina","Fritz Strassny"]','[""]','7.0','["tt0011221","tt0014586","tt0013579","tt0017739","tt0199971","tt0017338","tt0003419","tt0014397","tt0019130","tt0011237","tt0011833","tt0012651"]','["orlac;silent;film;wiene"]','[{"url":"/Orlacs.Hande.1924.Wiene.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/Orlacs.hande.1924.wiene-flv-FlashVideoFormat.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Orlacs.hande.1924.wiene-mkv-MatroskaVideo.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Orlacs.hande.1924.wiene-mov-QuicktimeVideo.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/TheHandsOfOrlac1924_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','TheHandsOfOrlac1924',20433,'Q684471','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

He quickly applies the emergency brakes, the train starts screeching to a halt but then derails. Several passengers are killed. An investigation cannot find any trace of the oncoming train that caused the derailment. Smoky is fired for negligence.
We come to find out Smoky has a beautiful daughter, Carolyn Nolan played by Sally Blane.  We also learn the CEO of the Southwest Pacific Railroad, Mr. Harrington played by Hobart Bosworth has a playboy son - Bruce Harrington played by William Collier, Jr..  
Because of the derailment and other ill fortunes, Mr. Harrington has decided to sell the railroad for a fraction of its worth. He will sign the papers at midnight. In the meantime, Bruce meets Carolyn and finds out she is the daughter of the fired engineer. They instantly bond, then decide to set out together and solve the mystery of the phantom express.  
During their investigation, they uncover a diabolical scheme concocted by a network of bad guys.   They find out the President of a rival railroad company played by Huntley Gordon has intentionally caused all of the accidents on the Southwest Pacific Railroad in order to drive the stock price down. The rival president figures after the stock plummets, he can buy all of the railroad''s rolling stock at a reduced price.
Bruce discovers the plot just hours before his father, Mr. Harrington, is going to sign the railroad over to the bad guys. He tried to telegraph his father but a storm has caused the telegraph to fail. In fact, the storm has knocked out all forms of communication.
In a twist of fate, the only way Bruce can advise his father not to sign the papers is to fire-up have train number 101, bring Smoky Nolan and his fireman out of retirement and somehow try to highball back to the central office to prevent his father from signing. The train travels through the storm-savaged countryside encountering floods, landslides, and other hazards.  Bruce arrives just in the nick of time, advising his father to nix the deal.  He exposes the plot by the rival railroad including how the bad guys constructed a piece of equipment and disguised it as an engine with headlights. They placed it on a nearby track causing Smoky to think he was heading towards a collision with an oncoming train.  Hence, the name - the phantom express. 
During their investigation, Bruce and Carolyn fell in love.  They decide to get married.

Gabbo''s gimmick is his astonishing ability to make Otto talk—and even sing—while Gabbo himself smokes, drinks and eats. Gabbo''s girlfriend and assistant Mary (Betty Compson) loves him, but is driven to leave him by his megalomania, superstitions, irritability, and inability to express any human emotion without using Otto as an intermediary. In Otto''s voice, Gabbo accepts the blame for Mary''s leaving and recounts all the things she did for him, but as Gabbo he denies his feelings and tells the dummy to shut up.
Two years later, Gabbo has become a nationally renowned ventriloquist. He is revered for his talent, even as he is ridiculed for his eccentricity: he takes Otto with him everywhere he goes, even dining out with him, providing much entertainment to the restaurant patrons. Despite his success he continues to pine for Mary, who is now romantically involved with another singer/dancer, Frank (Donald Douglas). With both Mary and Frank performing in a show in which Gabbo is the headliner, he attempts to win her back. Mary is charmed by Gabbo''s new romantic behavior, driving Frank to angry fits of jealousy. As his courtship meets with continued success, Gabbo increasingly expresses his emotions to Mary directly, without using Otto.
One day Gabbo finds that in his absence, Mary has straightened up his dressing room the way that she always used to. Convinced that she wants to come back to him, he confronts her with his feelings, admitting his loneliness without her and in the process revealing that he has grown past many of his old failings, such as his superstitions and obsession with his personal success. However, Mary tells him that she loves Frank, and has been married to him since before Gabbo came back into her life. She says that she missed Otto but not Gabbo, and in a last farewell she says "I love you" to Otto.
In profound frustration at this, after Mary is gone Gabbo punches Otto in the face, but immediately apologizes and embraces the dummy, weeping. He then storms onto the stage during the finale and loudly rants at the performers. He is forced off the stage and fired from the show. Mary tries to confront Gabbo afterwards, but he only looks at her sadly and walks away.

In his castle, Old King Cole  is having a long face for some reason. His personal jester tries to brighten him up but to no avail, and therefore leaves the throne room. Oswald then shows up and reads to him a book of comical rhymes. The rabbit''s attempt helps a little and the king''s mood improves slightly. Other entertainers (caricatures of film comedians Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, The Marx Brothers and Jimmy Durante ) also come in for a similar cause. Each of them has a distinctive method in providing comedy. It all comes down when some of them employs an act that involves hurling pies at each other. Eventually, everyone in the room joins the food fight, and so does the king who starts to enjoy it.
Momentarilly, the jester returns to the throne room to see what is happening. Upon noticing the king back in good spirits, the jester grows envious, and decides to take his grudge on one of the entertainers. The jester captures Oswald and brings the rabbit into a torture chamber at a basement of the castle. He then puts a noose around Oswald''s neck, with other end of the rope being pulled by three elephants. Oswald finds this ordeal impossible to get out of.
It appears the experience at the castle was nothing more than a nightmare as Oswald wakes up and sees himself still at the dental clinic. The dentist, at last, succeeds in extracting the tooth, and Oswald is relieved of his dental worries.',NULL,NULL,NULL,'[""]','6.0','["tt0025260","tt0023067","tt0025332","tt0026162","tt0027126","tt0024660","tt0029151","tt0023854","tt0022147","tt0027212","tt0022899","tt0033260"]','["Walt Disney; Vintage cartoons; classic cartoons; Black and white cartoons"]','[{"url":"/OswaldTheLuckyRabbitInAMerryOldSoul_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/oswald_the_lucky_rabbit_80_merry_old_soul_DVDRip.XviD-moonsong.sharethefiles.com.mp4","format":"h.264"}]','OswaldTheLuckyRabbitInAMerryOldSoul',7417,'Q2412800','wp',NULL,'["Walter Lantz","William Nolan"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Halfway there, after surviving their jettisoned and runaway first stage and a meteoroid storm, their engines suddenly quit. Recalculating fuel ratios and swapping fuel tank positions fixes the problem. After its engines ignite, RX-M rapidly careens out of control on a rapid heading beyond the Moon; lowered oxygen pressure also causes the crew to slowly pass out. They gradually revive much later and discover that with their engines still ignited, they have traveled some 50,000,000 miles and are now on a direct heading toward Mars. Quick calculations reveal that RX-M is just 50,000 miles away. Dr. Karl Eckstrom (John Emery) is forced to "pause and observe respectfully while something infinitely greater assumes control".
The RX-M safely passes through the Martian atmosphere and lands. The next morning the scientists, clad in aviation oxygen masks due to the low pressure, begin exploring the desolate surface. They come across physical evidence of a now dead advanced Martian civilization: a partially buried-in-the-sand, stylized, Art Deco- or Tiki culture-like  metal face sculpture and in the distance Moderne architecture-like ruins. Their Geiger counter registers dangerous radiation levels, keeping them well away; from the levels detected, there was once an atomic war on Mars in the distant past.
Finding cave refuge, the scientists notice in the distance the primitive human descendants of that civilization emerging from behind boulders and creeping toward them. Amazed, Dr. Eckstrom comments "From Atomic Age to Stone Age". Soon after leaving, two of the explorers encounter a dark-haired woman who has lost her footing and rolled down a hill toward them; she is blind, with thick, milky cataracts on both eyes. She screams upon hearing their oxygen mask-distorted voices. The radiation burned tribesmen attack, throwing large rocks and stone axes. Armed with only a revolver and a bolt-action rifle, the explorers defend themselves, purposely missing the primitives. Dr. Eckstrom is killed by a stone axe; navigator Chamberlain (Hugh O''Brian) is badly injured by a large thrown rock. The survivors finally make their way back to the RX-M.
As the RX-M nears Earth, the survivors calculate that they have no fuel to make a landing. Col. Graham contacts their base and reports their dire status to Dr. Fleming (Morris Ankrum), who listens intently and wordlessly over headphones. Col. Graham''s report is not heard, but Fleming''s subtle reactions tells of the crew''s odyssey, their discovery of a once advanced civilization destroyed long ago by atomic war, and of the crew fatalities at the hands of Martian descendants reverted to barbarism.
Col. Graham and Dr. Van Horn embrace as the RX-M begins its uncontrolled descent, consoling one another in the moments left to them. Through a porthole, they bravely watch their rapid descent into the wilds of Nova Scotia. The press is later informed by a shaken Dr. Fleming that the entire crew has perished. When they ask if the mission was a failure, he confidently responds with conviction, stating that all theories about manned spaceflight and exploration have now been proven. He continues, underscoring the point that a dire warning has been received from the crew that could very well mean the salvation of humanity, "A new spaceship, the RX-M-2, begins construction tomorrow". The pioneering exploration continues.','["Kurt Neumann"]','["Orville H.

('tt0037811','free','Identity Unknown (1945)','1945','59min','The story begins near the end of World War II in Europe. A soldier, suffering from amnesia, is on a hospital ship being helped by Major Williams, a medical doctor. The soldier was the only one of four infantrymen to survive when Nazi dive-bombers destroyed the farm house they were fighting the Germans from. The soldier and the U.S. Army do not know who he is. This is because when the four men''s dog tags were found afterwards, they had been blown off their bodies, and the Army does not know which of the four the surviving soldier is.
The soldier, now calling himself Johnny March, decides to find his true identity. When the hospital ship comes into port, he decides to visit the homes of the four different soldiers to find out who  he is. However, when he jumps off the train, on his way to an Army hospital, the Army believes he has deserted.
Private Johnny March looks up the first address on his list in Connecticut, and meets Sally, the widow of that soldier, with whom he becomes romantically involved. Since he wasn''t her husband, March goes on to the next address in West Virginia.
Upon his arrival, a young boy, Toddy,  welcomes him and believes it is his father who has come back. The misunderstanding is cleared up when the boy''s babysitter arrives and demands to know who March is. Toddy is disappointed when he finds out that his father hasn''t come home. But before he leaves March tells Toddy how his father died so that children could grow up in a free world.
March then goes on to Chicago, the next address, where he meets that soldier''s brother, a younger man named Joe. Joe works in a bookie joint as a cashier. As they talk, a gangster named Rocks Donnelly enters and demands that Joe pays him $6,000. Joe explains to his boss and March that he stole the money from Rocks to win money to finance a college education. When another rivaling gangster arrives to the scene, there is a shoot-out between the gangsters. Joe is wounded as he takes the bullets meant for Rocks Donnelly.
March accompanies Joe to the hospital and Rocks comes to thank Joe for saving his life. It turns out Joe isn''t interested in joining the mob, but wants to be a physician that his brother hoped to be. Donnelly offers to pay for his education.
Johnny attends Donnelly''s celebration party that same night, and meets Wanda, Donnelly''s girlfriend. After talking to March, Wanda realizes March is in love with another woman, and tells Johnny to call Sally and tell her. Sally tells Johnny to find his identity first, and then return to her to continue their relationship.
Johnny visits the last address on his list, the home of a soldier who lived on a farm in Iowa, but Peter''s parents doesn''t recognize him. They are about to sell their farm, after getting the news that their boy was killed in action. Before they can go through with the sale, March helps them realize the farm is where all their happy memories are, and the auction is stopped.
Sally calls, saying she has arrived at a nearby train station, and Johnny hurries over there. On the way, he is caught by the local sheriff for speeding and then by the military police for being AWOL. He is taken by the MPs to the Army hospital and the Army begin efforts to discover his identity.
Later Sally arrives and the doctors tell her that they now know who March really is, but he needs to discover it himself. After asking March a few questions, related to his pre-war career, March remembers  he is Captain Charles Aldridge. He had not been one of the four in the farm house, but on a mission to try to drop them supplies. Charles and Sally are able to leave the camp together to start a new life.','["Walter Colmes"]','["Richard Weil","Richard Weil"]','["Richard Arlen","Cheryl Walker","Roger Pryor"]','["Drama","War"]','6.1','["tt0035612","tt0036430","tt0042249","tt0037547","tt0089279","tt0044460","tt0045954","tt0043590","tt0034734","tt0037871","tt0036161","tt0035958"]','["Drama"]','[{"url":"/IdentityUnknown.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/IdentityUnknown_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/IdentityUnknown_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','IdentityUnknown',10972,'Q5988328','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

She informs her friends and fellow actors, Lily (Queenie Leonard) and Julia (Edith Barrett), about her plans, but since she does not have any housekeeping references, she convinces former exotic dancer Kitty Goode (Natalie Schafer), who has married into the peerage, to act as a fake reference.
Graham''s butler, Peabody (Reginald Gardiner), interview Molly, but when Kitty shows up, he recognizes her because he himself is former actor Harry Phillips, who left the profession because of a drinking problem he has since conquered. He then remembers Molly from her theatre work. Peabody does not want another former actor in the household.
Desperate, Molly persuades Peabody to join a party at a pub, where he falls off the wagon. She brings the half-unconscious man back to the Graham house, occupies the housekeeper''s room, and in the morning informs Mr. Graham that Peabody has hired her. Peabody has no other alternative but to go along.
Graham''s old friend, Jamie McDougall (Gordon Richards), asks him to stand again for Parliament. Graham is reluctant to do so and shows an old newspaper clipping to McDougall, reminding him that Graham ended his political career to avoid public disgrace after his wife ran off with a "sportsman." McDougall burns the clipping in the fireplace and tells Graham it all happened 15 years ago and will not be remembered.
Graham is convinced to travel to Suffolk to meet a man who could be of great help in his election bid, with Peabody acting as his chauffeur. While they are gone, Molly discovers that the domestic staff all steal from the household. When she confronts them, they threaten to quit en masse, but she sacks them instead. Molly puts the house in order by herself. From a fragment of the clipping she finds in the fireplace, Molly learns the truth about Graham''s ex-wife, who went abroad because of the scandal.
That night, Graham''s teenage son Jimmy (Roddy McDowall) unexpectedly returns home from prep school. Jimmy suffers from a fever and Molly takes care of him. Jimmy confides in Molly his difficulties with his father. While he was young, Jimmy was told that his mother died and is convinced that Graham does not like him because he is a constant reminder of it.
The next day, Peabody sends Molly a telegram telling her to prepare a formal dinner to which influential Sir Arthur Burroughs (Lewis L. Russell), publisher of a big London newspaper, will be a guest. Unable to find professional help on short notice, Molly hires her theatre friends.
Peabody recognizes them, but has to accept their services. Despite their numerous mistakes, the dinner is a success. The new staff celebrates in the kitchen, particularly pleased that the common English fare Molly improvised for dinner instead of food "of subtlety and distinction" impressed Sir Arthur much more. Jimmy joins their celebration. Graham comes down to the kitchen to congratulate them, but overhears Jimmy imitating his gruff pomposity and sour outlook. He sends Jimmy to bed and sacks the staff, including Peabody, when he learns from Molly that they are former entertainers. Molly uses the opportunity to scold Graham for being a poor father to his teenage son. By the next morning, Graham has thought over matters and gives his delighted son permission to re-hire the staff. 
The former Mrs. Graham makes an unexpected appearance to extort £1000 from her former husband. Molly tells her he is asleep, but promises to inform him of the sum she wants. Molly tells Graham that "something has happened," but before she can go into detail, he assures her that he has full confidence in her ability to fix any problem. To keep Graham from ever learning of the extortion attempt and Jimmy from discovering the truth about his mother, Molly uses her friends to fool Mrs. Graham into thinking that she has been a participant in a shooting death. Mrs. Graham flees the country.
Later that same evening, Mr. Graham and Jimmy return home after attending a theater performance and are greeted by the staff.  Mr. Graham comments that he and his son had an exciting night and that probably the staff found theirs dull in comparison. Jimmy promises to tell Mrs. Barry all about it in the morning and everyone but Mrs. Barry and Mr. Graham disperses.
Mr. Graham then remarks that he has been spoiled by Mrs. Barry’s late night snacks and wonders if she could fix him another one.  Obviously delighted, she agrees and asks if he would like it in his study.  He recalls that the kitchen is a cozy space and would like it there if possible and Mrs. Barry says it will be ready in a jiffy.
The final scene shows Mrs. Barry arranging the table and humming a tune.  Mr. Graham comes down the steps and asks for the words to be sung as well.  She happily obliges, with Mr. Graham joining in.  He then gets her a teacup, pulls out her chair and they sit together, singing the final line of the song in duet and promising many more happy times in the future.','["Lewis Seiler"]','["Leonard Praskins","Frances Marion"]','["Gracie Fields","Monty Woolley","Roddy McDowall"]','[""]','6.9','["tt0036009","tt0030261","tt0034976","tt0037330","tt0031593","tt0029861","tt0036395","tt0038948","tt0023960","tt0039595","tt0053143","tt0039101"]','["Gracie Fields;Monty Woolley"]','[{"url":"/Molly_and_Me_1945.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Molly_and_Me_1945_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/Molly_and_Me_1945_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','Molly_and_Me_1945',9170,'Q6896700','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

As they await death the two soldiers eventually realize that they were childhood friends, John Geste (Ralph Forbes) and Otis Madison (Lester Vail), respectively.
Once they recognize one another, they have a series of flashbacks to their boyhood friendship in England. These memories are followed by Otis'' memory of his return to England and discovery that John has joined the French Foreign Legion. While in England, Otis also learns that Isobel Landon (Loretta Young), who he is enamored with, is betrothed to John. Despite his feelings for her, he vows to follow John to Africa and return him to England. He makes arrangements and leaves for the dark continent.
Upon his arrival in Africa, Otis, and his detachment, are ordered to garrison a French fort in the desert. As hardships ensue, his fellow legionnaires begin to mutiny. Otis does not participate in the uprising, instead he attempts to get the other soldiers to cease their rebellion. When the uprising is eventually thwarted, the commanders do not believe Otis'' story, and assume that he was part of the rebellion, and send him to a penal detail. While part of that detail, he is again falsely accused, and is thrown into the pit, along with John, which puts them both in the pit where the film begins.
Back in the present, as they are about to die, they are miraculously rescued by a passing band of Arabs. Unknown to the two friends is that the Arabs intend to use them as bait to draw their fellow legionnaires into a death trap. Fortunately for the friends, the girlfriend of the Emir, Zuleika (Leni Stengel), also known as "the Angel of Death", is attracted to Otis. Otis uses that attraction and agrees to marry her, after which Zuleika informs him of an impending attack by the Arabs on the nearby fort, and then helps Otis and John to escape. The two legionnaires race to the fort, and help to repel the Arab attack, which earns both of them their freedom.
Otis now has to face up to his commitment to Zuleika. However, she has now transferred her affections to Major LeBaudy (Hale Hamilton), which allows Otis to be relieved of his matrimonial duties. Free from any entanglements, the two friends return to England.

Jo is about to step off the train when she hears that a famed Broadway show producer, Arthur Hale, is also stepping off the same train, leading Jo to depart from the other side of the train and make her own way to Sherry''s play.
Arthur also is attending Sherry''s school play. He overhears one of the older girls ridiculing Sherry''s claim that her sister is a stage singer; the girl doubts that Sherry''s sister even exists. Arthur comes to the rescue by praising Jo''s performances on stage.  Arthur, who is casting a new play, appreciates Sherry''s voice but believes she is too young to appear on Broadway.
Jo, Sherry, and Arthur meet after the play but no one is the wiser as to the reasons for Jo''s mysterious entrance. Jo also turns down an offer to audition for Arthur''s play.
On a trip to New York with her schoolfriend, Sherry rings Jo''s hotel where the clerk tells her she is performing in one of the theatres on 42nd Street. Sherry discovers that Jo is not a Broadway star, but a leading burlesque performer. Initially broken hearted, Sherry schemes that if she dresses to look older she will win the part in Arthur''s show and support Jo so she leaves burlesque. Arthur can not believe she can pass for over 18 but a score of servicemen at a nightclub prove Arthur wrong.
When bandleader Morton Gould hears Sherry singing along to the music, he invites her up to sing on the stage. Based on this performance, a radio producer in the audience offers her a contract. He retracts the offer, however, when he learns that Sherry''s sister is a burlesque performer. Meanwhile, Arthur shows romantic interest in Jo, but she coldly rebuffs him.
Stung by this rejection, Arthur retreats to his apartment to work on his upcoming musical, based on the music of Johann Strauss. He feels the show is destined to be a failure because the musical score simply doesn''t work.
As Sherry and Jo discuss Arthur''s musical, Jo expresses the opinion that the show will fail because audiences are looking for something more up-to-date than stuffy old Viennese waltzes. She demonstrates by improvising a jazzy version of a Strauss tune. Sherry then borrows her roommate''s recording machine and secretly makes a record of Jo singing her tune.
Sherry forces her way into Arthur''s apartment and pesters him into listening to the record. He is impressed in spite of himself, and hits upon a new idea for the show.
Soon after, the musical hit "Mr. Strauss Goes To Town" opens on Broadway, co-starring Jo and Sherry. The production mixes the traditional Strauss music (sung by Sherry in an old-fashioned operetta costume) with updated jazz interpretations of the tunes, performed by Jo in a showgirl outfit.

Gray is awakened suddenly by an old man, who enters the room and leaves a square packet on Gray''s table; "To be opened upon my death" is written on the wrapping paper. Gray takes the package and walks outside. Shadows guide him to an old castle, where he sees the shadows dancing and wandering on their own. Gray also sees an elderly woman (later identified as Marguerite Chopin) and encounters another old man (later identified as the village doctor). Gray leaves the castle and walks to a manor. Looking through one of the windows, Gray sees the Lord of the manor, the same man who gave him the package earlier. The man is suddenly murdered by gunshot. Gray is let into the house by servants, who rush to the aid of the fallen man but it is too late to save him. The servants ask Gray to stay the night. Gisèle, the younger daughter of the now deceased Lord of the manor, takes Gray to the library and tells him that her sister, Léone, is gravely ill. Just then they see Léone walking outside. They follow her, and find her unconscious on the ground with fresh bite wounds. They have her carried inside. Gray remembers the parcel and opens it. Inside is a book about horrific demons called Vampyrs.
By reading the book, Gray learns that Léone is a victim of a Vampyr. Vampyrs can force humans into submission. The village doctor visits Léone at the manor, and Gray recognizes him as the old man he saw in the castle. The doctor tells Gray that a blood transfusion is needed and Gray offers his blood to save Léone. Exhausted from blood loss, Gray sleeps. He wakes sensing danger and rushes to Léone, where he surprises the doctor as he is attempting to poison the girl. The doctor flees the manor, and Gray finds that Gisèle is gone. Gray follows the doctor back to the castle, where Gray has a vision of himself being buried alive. After the vision subsides, he rescues Gisèle but the doctor escapes. The old servant of the manor finds Gray''s Vampyr book and discovers that a Vampyr can be defeated by driving an iron bar through its heart. The servant meets Gray at Marguerite Chopin''s grave behind the village Chapel. They open the grave and find the old woman perfectly preserved. They hammer a large metal bar through her heart, killing her. The village doctor is hiding in an old mill, but finds himself locked in a chamber where flour sacks are filled. The old servant arrives and activates the mill''s machinery, filling the chamber with flour and suffocating the doctor. The curse of the Vampyr is lifted and Léone suddenly recovers.

Robinson) and sister Ellen (Judith Anderson) live on an isolated farm with their adoptive daughter, Meg (Allene Roberts). They keep to themselves and are viewed as mysterious by the nearby town. Now a teenager, Meg convinces Pete to hire one of her 12th-grade high school classmates, Nath Storm (Lon McCallister) to come help with chores on the farm. On the first evening, when it is time for him to go home, Nath says he is going to take a shortcut through the old woods.  The woods are part of Pete''s property and he forbids anyone from entering them.  Pete becomes agitated, insisting the woods are dangerous and contain a haunted house which is painted red, and that Nath must stay out.
After traveling though the woods in the dark, Nath returns spooked, after hearing moans and yells. However, a few days later, he is embarrassed at his cowardice and goes through the woods again after dark. Nath is struck from behind and knocked out. He returns to the farm and insists that Pete hit him, but Meg and Ellen say Pete has been in the room with them since Nath left. Soon, both Nath and Meg become obsessed with searching for the mysterious "red house" and agree to go into the woods every Sunday, which is the one day Nath has some free time, to look for it. They have no luck.
In the meantime, Meg begins to fall in love with Nath, but his jealous and shrewd girlfriend Tibby (Julie London) has other plans for him. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Pete has secretly given local handyman and petty thug Teller (Rory Calhoun) rights to hunt on the land, as long as he keeps everyone else off of the property.

One Sunday, Nath cannot get out of a date with Tibby, so Meg goes off on her own to look for the red house.  She finds it located in a small gully a few miles from Pete''s farm along an unused dirt road. Teller fires at her to scare her away. Running away, Meg falls and breaks her leg. That evening, when Meg does not return, Nath ventures into the woods to find her and brings her back to the farm. Pete is furious that both young people defied his warning to stay out of the woods and he outright fires Nath, banishing him from the farm and from seeing Meg again.
Some months later, Nath has been working for his mother at a local general store in town. His mother marries a long-time admirer and goes off for several weeks on her honeymoon, leaving Nath to mind the store. Nath soon takes additional work for the summer at another farm close to town. As Meg recovers from her broken leg, Pete begins to crack up. He starts calling her Jeannie, and becomes controlling and domineering. Ellen and Pete have a conversation about how it was that several years ago they rented the red house to a young couple. Pete was having an affair with the wife, Jeannie.
Nath catches Tibby flirting with Teller. He confronts her and finally learns how vain and selfish she is. Teller beats up Nath, while Tibby watches with satisfaction.
One evening, Ellen decides to burn the red house down, and end Pete''s obsession.  However, Teller fires at her.  Although he meant only to scare her, he hits and severely wounds her. Meg, having heard the gunshot, finds Ellen then rushes back to tell Pete, who refuses to act to help his sister. Meg phones Nath for help and he says he will bring a stretcher after he calls the sheriff and the doctor. Pete fails to dissuade Meg from returning to the woods. By the time Nath arrives, Ellen is dead. In the meantime, Teller goes to Tibby''s home and persuades her to leave town with him. They are pulled over and arrested by the state police.
Meg and Nath bring Ellen''s body back. Meg demands the truth about the red house and who Jeannie is.  Pete finally confesses that Ellen had been keeping the secret for him, about having had an affair with a married woman named Jeannie and what had happened to her and the husband.  After the man discovered the affair, the couple decided to move away. Pete went to the red house to plead with Jeannie to choose between her husband and him.  As they heard her husband returning, Jeannie began screaming. To stop her, Pete covered her mouth, but suffocated her. Pete claims he was just trying to keep her quiet, and her death was accidental. However, he admits that he killed the husband in cold blood. Pete buried the bodies in the basement of the ice house that sits next to the red house, and he lives in fear that they will be discovered. However, since Jeannie''s husband told everyone they were leaving town, no one ever suspected they were murdered. The couple had a baby, Meg, and rather than abandon the infant, Pete and Ellen adopted her.
Pete takes Meg to the red house. By this point, he has completely gone crazy and thinks Meg is actually Jeannie, who is leaving him again. He begins to re-live the experience, puts his hand over her mouth and starts suffocating her.  Nath and the sheriff show up in time. Pete takes off in his truck, but drives into the ice house, where the truck sinks in the large pond formed by the melted ice, and Pete drowns.
The final scene shows Nath and Meg a few days later, talking about starting a new life together, as they watch the smoke from the red house. Nath has burned it down to put it in the past.','["Delmer Daves"]','["George Agnew Chamberlain","Delmer Daves"]','["Edward G.

He goes to see a man in New York, Dan Barker, a songwriter who knew Kate in the past when she lived in the city. Dan tells Paul that Kate changed her name to Kitty Travers, and then continues to tell the story of what he knows about "Kitty":
Dan met Kitty when she was looking for work as a model and she happened to stay at the same boarding house as he and his girlfriend Linda Waring. A friend of Kitty''s told her she could work as co-respondent in alimony cases where the man was framed to up the settlement sum. She started working for a lawyer Burt Crail and became involved in a big scandal, posing in a picture with a married man.
Kitty apparently showed an aptitude for the work and made a good chunk of money. In the end she became interested in Dan, just when he was about to break through as a songwriter.
Dan fell in love with Kitty and wrote her a song, breaking up with his girlfriend Linda. When Kitty found out that Dan wasn''t going to be the success they expected, she left him and he resumed his relationship with his ex Linda. They married, and then came his real breakthrough, when the song he wrote for Kitty became a successful hit.
Kitty returned and wanted a piece of the cake, demanding to sing the song on Dan''s tour around the country. Again, Dan fell in love with Kitty and eventually left his wife. The relationship only survived long enough for the royalty money to be spent and then Kitty left Dan again. He again returned to Linda, who took him back.
Kitty went on to bigger fish, marrying a millionaire named George Griswold, but secretly working for Crail again. Crail arranged for Griswold to be photographed with another woman, but before they got a settlement, it turned out Griswold had set them both up by sending a double, Curtis Carter.
Both Crail and Kitty was arrested for fraud, together with several other accomplices. This concludes Dan''s story about Kitty. When he is done, Paul gets news that Kate, who is out on parole from her prison sentence, has been involved in a car crash and lies in a hospital.
Paul goes to the hospital and visits his daughter. They reconcile and he promises to help her start a new and better life.','["Alfred Zeisler"]','["George Bricker","Royal K.

In addition to blaming him for causing her accident, she resents that he has somehow avoided military service, but when he goes to get some gas, she discovers a uniform (with many decorations) in his suitcase and becomes friendlier to him. They reveal their odd names, but nothing else about themselves: he is Marion and she is "Willie".  He is sure that she is a spoiled rich girl, and in fact Wilhelmina "Willie" Hammond is indeed a member of a wealthy high society family, running from an arranged marriage to another socially prominent type, stolid Alvin Bailey.  
Acting on the reported theft of Bailey''s car, the police stop the pair and put them in jail.  After the police talk to Bailey on the telephone, the two are released. Willie takes Marion to the family mansion, telling him that she is the family''s secretary. Having lost her key, she has him crawl through a window, causing the pair to be taken into custody again. Reporters at the police station eventually recognize her, revealing her identity to Marion. They are again released. 
Willie initially thinks that Marion is an Army deserter, but after he explains he received a medical discharge, she gives him a job as the family chauffeur, even though Wiggins, the eccentric old caretaker of the estate, has misgivings.
Willie''s widowed mother, Mrs. Hammond, "old maid" Aunt Harriet and younger sister Patricia all return from New York, along with Alvin Bailey and Bailey''s physical trainer and sidekick, Champ. Mrs. Hammond and Bailey strongly disapprove of Willie''s association with a presumed gold digger. Mrs. Hammond tries to buy Marion off, while Bailey sends Champ to get the police. Marion, however, is determined to win Willie''s heart.
After a series of family arguments and complications, Marion is revealed to be a nationally known war hero. He was hitchhiking simply because he does not like publicity. He is warmly welcomed by the mayor and the governor, and honored with a parade by Plainfield. His killed-in-battle friend described his hometown so vividly to Marion and later bequeathed it to him, so, having no real ties to any other place, he decided to settle there. As Marion is being driven away, Willie sets out after him in her wedding dress, and, in a role reversal, he gives her a ride.','["Christy Cabanne"]','["Christy Cabanne","Robert Lee Johnson"]','["Dave O''Brien","Kay Aldridge","Walter Catlett"]','[""]','5.9','["tt0025921","tt0031038","tt0037972","tt0029695","tt0032576","tt0040868","tt0047178","tt0041503","tt0034711","tt0037932","tt0039947","tt0041733"]','["Dave O''Brien;Kay Aldridge;Guinn \"Big Boy\" Williams;PRC;P.R.C."]','[{"url":"/Man_Who_Walked_Alone.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Man_Who_Walked_Alone_1945_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/Man_Who_Walked_Alone_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','Man_Who_Walked_Alone_1945',26627,'Q7749981','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Tired of losing gigs to the Perennials, Artie Shaw, playing himself, comes to woo Ellen away to be his booking manager. She tries to get Danny and Hank an audition for Shaw''s band, but their jealous hi-jinks get them fired.
Ellen talks Shaw into letting rich wannabee musician J. Lester Chisholm (Charles Butterworth) back a concert.

('tt0072937','free','Encounter with the Unknown (1972)','1972','1h 30min','The film presents three allegedly true stories of the supernatural. The first story, "The Heptagon", opens on a somber note at the funeral of college student Johnny Davis. His friends Dave, Frank and Randy are in attendance at the burial. It is revealed that they played a seemingly innocent phone prank on Johnny, telling him to go to a certain address where a date was waiting. The old woman who lived at the address accidentally shot Johnny to death. As the funeral service ends, Johnny''s mother (who is the seventh daughter of a seventh son) recites a cryptic message to the three young men she blames for the death of her son: "One by land, two by sky...seven times around go the three of you, and may your reward be just and true." Later Frank relates this story to a priest, Father Duane, sitting next to him on a plane. He says that Dave was run over and killed seven days after the funeral. The priest tries to ease Frank''s anxiety,  assuring him that it''s all a coincidence. However, after Father Duane exits the plane, it crashes upon takeoff. On the runway Father Duane attempts to comfort a dying Frank, who tells him that exactly fourteen days have passed since Johnny''s burial. The troubled priest--beginning to suspect that there might be more to this pattern of deaths than mere chance--speaks to his superior, who suggests telephoning the remaining young man at the state university. Father Duane tries to call Randy but instead reaches his roommate, who tells him that Randy has gone skydiving. It is now twenty-one days after Johnny''s burial, the narrator reminds us, and according to Mrs. Davis''s prophecy, two of the young men would perish by sky. 
The second story, "The Darkness", is set in rural Missouri during the early twentieth century and involves the disappearance of a boy''s dog in the vicinity of a mysterious hole in the ground. Concerned about the inexplicable moaning sounds coming from the hole, the boy''s father agrees to be lowered in on a rope to see if he can recover the dog and to find out what''s making the noise. Suddenly a terrifying scream emerges from the depths of the pit and the boy''s father, now a raving lunatic, is hoisted back up. The mystery of the hole is never solved, and the story closes with the narrator''s revelation that the father spent the rest of his life in an insane asylum. 
The final segment, "The Girl on the Bridge", involves a strange disoriented girl and the Arkansas state senator who attempts to give her a ride home. Most of the story unfolds via the girl''s flashbacks; as the senator and his wife arrive at the address the girl had given them, they find that she has mysteriously vanished from the back seat of the car. The girl''s elderly father answers the door, telling the senator that his daughter died in a car accident many years earlier when she and her boyfriend were leaving town to get married. The father had disapproved of the relationship and told his daughter that he would rather see her dead.  
According to the opening narration, the stories are based on research conducted by Dr. Jonathan Rankin, a parapsychologist, but this is evidently a fictional device as no record of the name "Jonathan Rankin" exists in the annals of parapsychological research. One of the segments, "The Girl on the Bridge", is simply a version of the Vanishing hitchhiker, a widespread and very popular urban legend. The stories themselves are narrated by Rod Serling, but the opening and closing portions of the film feature a second, uncredited narrator. The film was shot in Little Rock, Arkansas, at locations which include the Capital Hotel and Mount Holly Cemetery.','["Harry Thomason"]','["Jack Anderson","Joe Glass"]','["Rod Serling","Robert Ginnaven","Gary Brockette"]','["Horror","Mystery"]','4.9','["tt0058403","tt0076853","tt0096046","tt0122722","tt0075334","tt0401696","tt0069994","tt0059125","tt0052442","tt6158692","tt0067503","tt0100156"]','["full movie ; horror ; mystery ; witches ; prank ; anthology ; Rod Serling ; urban legends ;"]','[{"url":"/EncounterWithTheUnknown.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/EncounterWithTheUnknown_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/EncounterWithTheUnknown_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','EncounterWithTheUnknown',41586,'Q5375586','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

While performing the procedure, however, he falls in love with her.  As the treatment begins to fail, he determines to save her appearance, regardless of how many women he must kill for her sake.
Despite the implication of its American title, the film does not feature an actual vampire.  The titular Seddok is actually the brilliant but deranged scientist Dr. Levin, mutated by a chemical formula created using radiation.  Dr. Levin studied the effects of radiation on living tissue in post-Hiroshima Japan, and created an imperfect and teratogenic serum, "Derma 25", which he later refined into the miraculous healing agent "Derma 28" which he uses to treat the heroine.  When his supply of Derma 28 runs out, he realizes he must kill to obtain more, and injects himself with Derma 25 in order to become monstrous and remorseless, so that he may seek these victims without hesitation.
Because many of the murders take place near the docks where shiploads of Japanese refugees are arriving, and leave behind the victims'' bodies with holes in the neck where Dr. Levin has extracted the glands, the refugees claim that a vampire (whom they call "Seddok", though this is not a Japanese name) is responsible for the attacks.  During a meeting with police, a restored-to-humanity Dr. Levin speculates that the Hiroshima survivors'' tales of a mutated killer are due to psychological strain from the radiation damage to their bodies...but also wonders aloud whether the "vampire" these witnesses describe might simply be a disturbed man wishing to be normal again.','["Anton Giulio Majano"]','["Piero Monviso","Gino De Santis"]','["Alberto Lupo","Susanne Loret","Sergio Fantoni"]','["Horror","Sci-Fi"]','3.8','["tt0083959","tt0055902","tt0034521","tt0054691","tt0035784","tt0028174","tt0054673","tt0060097","tt0054768","tt0094860","tt0056633","tt0037084"]','["1960s;foreign films;horror"]','[{"url":"/AtomAgeVampire.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/AtomAgeVampire_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/AtomAgeVampire_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','AtomAgeVampire',137652,'Q4817209','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Their friend and colleague, Gail Tempest (Suzanne Kaaren), is a dancer at the Black Bottom cafe where the Stooges are musicians. She is accused of killing Kirk Robin (a play on "Who Killed Cock Robin?").

When the Stooges are called to the witness stand, they are nowhere to be found. The defense attorney (Bud Jamison) goes out into the hall only to find the Stooges playing jacks and tic-tac-toe simultaneously on the floor. After considerable mutual frustration, the court finally swears in Curly, who begins to describe the events that took place on the night of the murder. He offers to show the court exactly what happened. The Stooges and Gail are part of a musical act; and the Stooges break into their musical routine to prove this, with Larry on violin, Moe harmonica, and Curly on both spoons and upright bass. Gail Tempest shrugs off her coat and reveals her dancer costume, to the great surprise of the jury.
The act is interrupted when Larry unknowingly mistakes a man''s toupée for a tarantula and Moe subsequently takes the guard''s gun and starts shooting the toupée, causing pandemonium in the court. After the song ends, Curly slaps Moe on the back and makes him swallow his harmonica, briefly turning him into a musical instrument that Larry and Curly comically play a song with before Curly helps Moe spit the harmonica back out. Curly is then seen chewing gum and sternly told by the judge to get rid of it. He throws it away, but it accidentally lands on Moe''s face. Larry then takes a napkin and  removes the gum, twisting Moe''s nose in pain. Larry then stomps on it and bellows out in a loud exaggerated Tarzan yell. Moe slaps him and tells him to get out. After everything is brought under control, Moe and Curly re-enact the actual murder (with Curly on the receiving end). Moe then looks at the parrot, who was at the murder scene, and sees a note tied to the parrot''s foot. He opens the parrot cage, and the parrot flies out after it scratches Moe''s finger. The Stooges eventually capture the bird by shooting water at it through a fire hose. Moe then reads the letter out loud and reveals that it is a confession from the real murderer, Buck Wing, which finally proves Gail''s innocence. The note also said that Buck Wing will disappear. Just when they are going to get their picture taken at the front page, the water hose (which had to be tied in a knot to stop the flow of water when the bailiff broke the fixture trying to turn it off) explodes, wetting everyone in attendance.','["Jack White"]','["Felix Adler","Felix Adler"]','["Moe Howard","Larry Fine","Curly Howard"]','[""]','8.1','["tt10356010","tt0033312","tt0036381","tt0037813","tt0032270","tt0058832","tt0051189","tt0383010","tt0047460","tt0045710","tt0057624","tt0019688"]','["comedy;short;three stooges"]','[{"url":"/disorder_in_the_court.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/disorder_in_the_court_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/disorder_in_the_court_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','disorder_in_the_court',220854,'Q2789524','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

A sister, Laura (Mala Powers), who has inherited the family home, serves as a housekeeper and cook to the brothers. Some of them served in the Civil War, which has given them a hardened attitude toward violence. One brother is killed when they go after a bank in a nearby town, leading them to draw the conclusion that someone that they know is an informant, as the men of the town appeared to have been waiting for them. They soon learn that it was Murphy, a local bartender, whom they then murder by knocking him out, and tying him up in his barn, which they then set ablaze. The bartender was in fact an agent employed by the Peterson (in real life, Pinkerton) Detective Agency sent to investigate and provide information about the Reno Brothers'' crimes.
His replacement is Scott''s character, James Barlow, a former secret agent for the Confederacy, who determines to join the gang by posing as a train robber, a ploy which is aided by his being allowed to pull off a staged train robbery (with the full cooperation of the train crew) in the area.  (He also begins courting the sister.)  Grudgingly accepted by the brothers (led by Tucker''s character, Frank Reno), he soon learns that they have corrupted local officials, including a judge (played by veteran character actor Edgar Buchanan), allowing them to operate in that part of the state with near-impunity.  The brothers plan a train robbery with Barlow, but this proves to be a setup in which they are captured following a shootout and taken to an area jail outside the jurisdiction of the corrupted officials.  (In the shootout, Barlow''s fellow Peterson agent, Monk Claxton, is killed.)  Townspeople are incited to mob violence and break into the jail and lynch the brothers before they can be brought to trial despite Barlow''s best efforts to stop this.

His dad is strict with Johnnie and is constantly criticizing him. Johnnie has a girlfriend, Betty Palmer, who works as a waitress at the local drive-in. Maurie Weston, the town bully, owns a fancy hot rod and teases Johnny about him not being allowed to have a car. One night at the drive in, Maurie makes a move on Betty, but she rebuffs his advances, and ends up letting Johnnie drive her home in her brother''s car. On the way there, Johnnie gets stopped by the police for speeding and driving recklessly. The police drive him home and give his dad a summons to appear in court with his son. His father berates him for his careless behavior, while Aunt Martha suggests that maybe he should spend more time with his son.
Later, Johnnie gets a summer job at a gas station, without telling his dad. The owner of the station is building a hot rod to race and encourages Johnnie to help him with it. After his father finds out about his new job, he demands that he quit and come to work for him in his real estate office. Later that night, Johnnie and Betty are having dinner together when Maurie again tries to make a move on Betty, and Johnnie gets mad and challenges him to a fight. Maurie suggest that they race instead, and although Johnnie doesn''t have a car, he agrees to meet him in an hour. Betty refuses to lend him her brother''s car again, so Johnnie asks her to take him to a used car lot where he persuades the salesman to let him test drive a hot rod. Johnnie promises to return the car the next morning.
When the two meet up to race, Maurie takes him to a deserted stretch of highway, where he suggests they drive towards each other in a "chicken contest". The winner being the one who doesn''t chicken out and swerve away. Betty and a crowd of other teenage friends follow them to the location. After the race starts and when the two boys are about to collide, Betty runs right into the middle of their path, which causes both of them to swerve to avoid hitting her. Unbeknownst to the two boys, Betty called the police on her way there, and upon arrival Maurie takes off. The police take Johnnie and Betty to the station where their parents are called to come pick them up.
After feuding with his father, Johnnie tells Betty he is leaving town and goes to the gas station and steals the hot rod.  The owner calls the police and Johnnies father and tells them what has happened. Later, Johnnie calls Betty and admits he has stolen the car. Betty then informs him that the owner has entered the car into a race that afternoon. The gas station owner has a hunch that Johnnie will show up to race the car and invites Johnnies father and Betty to join him at the race. Sure enough, Johnnies shows up and the owner asks him to race the car, and he competes against Maurie. Johnnie wins the race, has a confrontation with Maurie and beats him up. Johnnie is now back on good terms with his father, Betty and the owner. Johnnies dad offers to buy the hot rod for him, and on their way home in the newly purchased hot rod, the three get stopped by the police and this time it''s his dad who gets the speeding ticket.','["Paul Helmick"]','["Rudy Makoul","Paul Helmick"]','["Chuck Courtney","Melinda Byron","Robert Fuller"]','["Drama"]','5.7','["tt0051139","tt0051724","tt0051725","tt0050545","tt0050210","tt0062365","tt0051432","tt0051555","tt0027087","tt0050294","tt0051380","tt0052077"]','["Drama"]','[{"url":"/TeenageThunder.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/TeenageThunder_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/TeenageThunder_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','TeenageThunder',15500,'Q7694457','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Confronted by him wielding a short sword, the gang decides to come back at night but find him dead.  Their father figure Police Lieutenant "Pops" Stevens tell them they should be ashamed of themselves as Keno, the owner of the shop, was Chinese, an ally of America and that Danny should be especially ashamed as his brother is in the service.
The boys buy some flowers and go to the shop to apologize to the widow and notice a Japanese man take a pen from a locker the widow opened for him.  Glimpy steals the pen and find that it contains a message written in Japanese.
They visit a Japanese shop run by Mr. Matsui to have it translated. He tries to steal the message but the gang threatens him, whereupon Mr. Matsui commits hara-kiri in their presence.  The boys run to the police.
Matusui''s son (Philip Ahn) successfully disguises himself as his late father to impersonate him and discredit the boys to the police.  The boys take the law in their own hands to discover that Matsui is in league with German residents of the neighborhood (such as Gabriel Dell, who would play a different role in each film of the series) who are in a sabotage group called the Black Dragon Society. In a subplot, Danny''s brother Phil (Tom Brown) has supposedly been dishonourably discharged from the US Navy but is working undercover to infiltrate the Black Dragons. Danny''s brother''s girlfriend Nora (Florence Rice), (who is in the WAVES) has a Japanese friend she went to high school with whom she seeks help from to translate the message. However he turns out to be Matsui''s son, the leader of the spy ring and has her locked up in a cell in the basement of the shop.
The gang breaks into Matsui''s shop that is filled with haunted house type secret passageways and trapdoors where they discover the Black Dragon Society dressed in hooded costumes that Glimpy refers to as "Japanese Halloween".  The gang frees Nora and revenges the attack on Pearl Harbor by beating up the saboteurs. The film ends with Nora and Phil getting married but as they walk down the church steps with a sabre arch of East Side Kids holding their captured Japanese swords (that are quickly confiscated by the police at the end of the ceremony!).

Charlie opportunistically happens upon a man in a rowboat who is preparing for a swim.  Charlie steals the man''s swimsuit and heads to shore.  He hears cries for help as a woman (Edna Purviance), her mother, and the woman''s suitor (Eric Campbell) have all fallen into the water and are poor swimmers.  Charlie rescues them all, but carelessly allows the enormous suitor to fall back into the water while he is attempting to carry him on a stretcher.  Charlie rescues him once again, but the angry suitor kicks Charlie senseless into the water.  Charlie wakes up in a bedroom in the lavish home of the grateful girl and her mother.  He is wearing striped pajamas and for a moment he believes he is back in prison.  He identifies himself as a yachtsman and is given a set of evening clothes to wear to a party. Charlie''s luck begins to run out, however.  The girl''s father turns out to be the judge who sentenced Charlie to a prison term.  Charlie looks vaguely familiar to the judge, but he cannot quite place him.  The suitor, now especially miffed at Charlie because of the attention the girl is giving him, sees Charlie''s photo in a newspaper as a prison escapee.  Meanwhile, a house employee is feeding her beau a meal in the kitchen; the beau happens to be one of the guards who was chasing Charlie on the beach.  The suitor summons the authorities who pursue Charlie on a merry chase up and down the two-story house where Charlie''s acrobatic skills save him from arrest several times.  Just as it looks like Charlie will finally be apprehended, he cleverly escapes again and the chase is renewed.  
The film also stars Henry Bergman and Albert Austin, and marked the final film of his co-star Eric Campbell who died on December 20, 1917 in a drunk driving accident. Campbell, who was 37 at the time of his death, had appeared in 11 comedies with Chaplin in 1916 and 1917.
Toraichi Kono, who was Chaplin''s personal chauffeur for many years, plays a small part in the film.

The miserly Grandet, despite being the wealthiest man in his province, forces his family to live in poverty and schemes to cheat his nephew out of his inheritance from his father.
Charles falls in love with Grandet''s daughter Eugenie (Alice Terry) but Grandet condemns their love, and sends Charles away. While Charles is away, Grandet kills Eugenie''s mother, which sends him further into a maddened state. Later, it is revealed that Eugenie is not really Monsieur Grandet''s daughter; if she knew, then she could reclaim all of the gold that originally belonged to her mother, leaving her father penniless. Monsieur Grandet has a violent argument with Eugenie, after she finds letters sent by Charles that her father had hidden, and Monsieur Grandet accidentally locks himself in a small room where he keeps his gold. He starts hallucinating and is eventually killed after becoming frantic.
Eugenie is now left an extremely wealthy young lady, which only intensifies the pressure put on her by two competing families to marry one of the suitors. She announces her engagement, but shortly after is reunited with Charles.','["Rex Ingram"]','["June Mathis","Honoré de Balzac"]','["Alice Terry","Rudolph Valentino","Ralph Lewis"]','[""]','6.8','["tt0012190","tt0012952","tt0012675","tt0013404","tt0015772","tt0013515","tt0017416","tt0012938","tt0015693","tt0015145","tt0011130","tt0012408"]','["Drama; Silent"]','[{"url":"/TheConqueringPower_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/TheConqueringPowerrexIngram1921RudolphValentinoAliceTerry.mp4","format":"h.264"}]','TheConqueringPower',8543,'Q3060270','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

One exception, they agree, is Danny Breslin (Bobby Jordan), a young boxer who is studying economics and destined for success. While Danny''s future looks bright, the future of his former best friend, Muggs McGinnis (Leo Gorcey), appears to hold little more than troubles with the law and juvenile probation. One day, when Danny learns that Muggs has been speaking poorly of his schoolteacher sister Mary (Charlotte Henry), he marches over to Clancy''s Pool Hall, their favorite neighborhood haunt, and punches Muggs. The fight eventually turns into a pool hall riot, which results in Muggs''s arrest. Officer Tom Brady (Warren Hull), Mary''s sweetheart, believes that many of the boys can be reformed, and when he learns that Muggs has been involved in another fight, he tries to enlist Danny''s help in determining the reason behind Muggs'' propensity to fight. Danny surprises his mother, sister and Tom when he violently protests Tom''s request, saying that he hates "coppers," and vows never to return to the police gym for his boxing practice. While Tom lays plans to reform Muggs by entering him as a fighter in the upcoming Golden Glove Tournament, Danny unwittingly gets involved with notorious thug Monk Martin (Bobby Stone). Unknown to Danny, Monk has used him to drive his getaway car in a grocery store holdup. After paying Danny for his "services," Monk manages to persuade him to quit school and join his racket. Meanwhile, Muggs, having made great strides at the Whitney reform school, goes to live with Tom and his mother (Martha Wentworth), much to the dismay of Mary, who promptly breaks off her relationship with Tom. Muggs eventually wins the respect of the entire neighborhood and earns the police department''s sponsorship of his fight in the Golden Glove Tournament. So completely has Muggs given up his delinquent ways that he curses Monk when the racketeer offers him $1,000 to take a fall in the tournament fight. Later, after overhearing Tom''s mother blaming his arrival for the break-up of Tom and Mary''s relationship, Muggs becomes despondent and decides to move out. Just before the fight, crooked fight promoter Slats Morrison (Eddie Foster) plants the intended bribery money in Muggs''s gear and tries to frame him. Danny, meanwhile, is wounded by Tom as he and Monk are caught fleeing from a robbery. Hospitalized and in desperate need of blood, Danny''s life hangs in the balance until Muggs volunteers his blood and saves his best friend. Mary has a change of heart and returns to Tom, and Tom announces that Monk made a full confession before dying. Danny''s family gathers around a radio and listens with pride as Muggs knocks out his opponent at the tournament. Following the fight, Slats and his boss Dorgan are arrested, and Tom and Mary look forward to their wedding.','["Wallace Fox"]','["Brendan Wood","Donn Mullahy"]','["Leo Gorcey","Bobby Jordan","Huntz Hall"]','["Comedy","Crime","Drama","Romance","Sport"]','6.2','["tt0032277","tt0035092","tt0034224","tt0037074","tt0035345","tt0034420","tt0035741","tt0033144","tt0033613","tt0034064","tt0034973","tt0036073"]','["Comedy;East Side Kids"]','[{"url":"/bowery_blitzkrieg.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/bowery_blitzkrieg_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/bowery_blitzkrieg_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','bowery_blitzkrieg',67922,'Q4950929','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

So does his boss, Lackey (Charles C. Wilson). Confident in his abilities and knowing that he is the airline''s best pilot, he pays neither any mind.
Federal agent Brownell (Henry O''Neill) urgently requests Lackey''s cooperation: Clement Williams (Edward McWade) must be flown from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C., with a cylinder full of a revolutionary new explosive he has invented. However, Lackey''s assistant Jason (Arthur Pierson) is eavesdropping on him for Taggart (Russell Hicks), a spy.
He eavesdrops again when Lackey chooses Bob as pilot and Judy''s brother Tom (Robert Light) as co-pilot. Taggart sends three men to provoke Bob into a fistfight. While Bob is knocked out, another pilot, George Wexley (Gordon Westcott), chats casually with Tom, "learns" that Bob is late for the special trip, and offers to protect Bob''s job by taking over.
Over the lower Sierras, the Ford Trimotor airliner explodes.
Bob and Lackey fly to the crash site and talk to Brownell. Tom''s cap is there. Back in Los Angeles, they report that there are no survivors.
Frantic for news of her brother, Judy drives to the site before they return, evading the police roadblock. She is recognized by Jason, who is traveling with the spies to a nearby house they are using. Improvising a plan, they pose as federal agents and stop her.
At the house she is surprised to see Wexley, who tells her the saboteur ordered him and Tom to parachute out, then set a bomb and himself parachuted out with the cylinder—all nearly true, except that Wexley was the saboteur and Tom is dead. They want to hide the cylinder in Judy''s car and trick her into driving to Mexico, so Wexley says that Tom has gone to Tijuana to identify a suspect. She agrees to leave in the morning. But then the radio reports the recovery of Tom''s body. Realizing her predicament, Judy pretends not to have heard. That night, finding some paint, she paints Bob''s three-star personal logo on the porch roof of the house.
Next day, back at Los Angeles, Bob learns Jason has left the office—with the three men who knocked him out. He and Lackey then discover Jason''s eavesdropping device. Bob flies back to the crash area. As his co-pilot he takes Wings, who works as the airline''s mechanic because when he got his pilot''s license he learned he was afraid to fly. They see the three stars and land.
Bob tells Wings that if there is any sign of trouble he must fly away and alert the Air Patrol. When shots are fired, Wings does just that—not seeing Bob and Judy running for the plane. The spies capture them both.
Wexley and Taggart depart in Wexley''s armed biplane, taking Judy and the cylinder. Wings then arrives with the Air Patrol, who capture the rest of the gang after a brief gunfight.
In a dogfight between biplanes, Taggart is killed but the Air Patrol plane is shot down. Now rescued, Bob takes off with Wings. He finds Wexley''s plane and executes risky maneuvers to force him to land. Wexley tries to run away and Wings throws a rock at him. Both Judy and the cylinder are recovered.

The Raiders rustle the stagecoach and Pony Express horses from the various relay stations to cut all lines of communication to and from the east. Bill Hickok is sent out to one of the relay stations in hopes that he would be able to keep the ponies from the raiders. Calamity and Gabby, horse traders for the relay stations, ride up with their Indian helpers just as Bill finishes off the last few Raiders that had attacked his post. Bill has been severely hurt so Calamity and Gabby stick around for a while.
During this time, Bill''s old fiancée, Louise Mason, shows up. She wants to make up after their breaking their engagement over her support for the Confederacy and Bil''s for the North.  They agree to forget the war; she and Bill are soon planning a wedding. However, Marshal Evans, head of the communication lines, wants Bill to take a shipment of gold through to the east to support the Federal war effort.

The plan backfires when Louise tells Tower that Bill isn''t taking the gold to protect Bill from attack. The Raiders attack Gabby and get away with the gold.

While waiting for a train to London, Neale visits a village fête hosted by the Mothers of Free Nations charity. He guesses the weight of a cake for a shilling, apparently failing to guess the cake''s true weight, and is urged to go to the palm reader''s tent to have his fortune told by Mrs. Bellane (Aminta Dyne), an older woman. He asks her to ignore the past and tell the future, which startles her. She cryptically tells him to take another guess at the weight of the cake at 4 pounds 15½ ounces. Neale does so and wins the prize, the cake itself. Then a young blond man hurries to see Mrs. Bellane. People try to persuade Neale to give the cake to the blond man, but Neale refuses, as his initial guess was closer to the cake''s true weight than the blond man''s guess, by a few ounces.
Neale departs Lembridge with only a blind man (Eustace Wyatt) sharing his train compartment. Neale offers him some cake. Neale sees the blind man crumbling his portion. When the train stops during a Luftwaffe air raid, Neale''s companion turns out not to be blind after all. He strikes Neale with his walking stick, steals the cake, and flees, with Neale in pursuit. The man shoots at him, but is killed by a German bomb. Neale finds the man''s revolver and continues on to London.
Neale hires private detective George Rennit (Erskine Sanford) to help him investigate the Mothers of Free Nations. Neale meets Willi Hilfe (Carl Esmond) and his sister Carla (Marjorie Reynolds), refugees from Nazi Austria who run the charity. Willi takes him to Mrs. Bellane''s London mansion (followed by Rennit). Neale is shocked to discover that this Mrs. Bellane (Hillary Brooke) is a beautiful young medium. She invites them to stay for her séance. Among the other attendees are artist Martha Panteel (Mary Field), psychiatrist Dr. Forrester (Alan Napier), and Mr. Cost (Dan Duryea), the blond man at the fête. After the lights are dimmed, a mysterious voice claims she was poisoned by Stephen, disconcerting Neale. Then a shot rings out – Cost is found shot dead. Neale admits to having the blind man''s gun. He flees with Willi''s help.
Neale goes to Rennit''s office, only to find it ransacked. He talks to Carla. An air raid forces the two to shelter in an Underground station, where Neale reveals that he had planned to euthanize his terminally ill wife. He changed his mind, but she committed suicide anyway, using poison he had bought. Due to the circumstances, Neale received a light sentence of two years at the asylum. He confides that he is still unsure if in buying the poison for his wife he had made the right decision.
The next morning, Carla hides Neale at a friend''s bookstore. Neale spots a book by Forrester, The Psychoanalysis of Nazidom. Carla reveals that Forrester is one of her volunteers as well as a consultant for the Ministry of Home Security. Neale is convinced that Carla''s organization is a front for Nazi spies. Carla finds out that almost all the people Neale suspects are charity volunteers, but all recommended by Forrester. She tells Willi about her discovery, and admits that she loves Neale.
That afternoon, Neale goes to Panteel''s flat, only to find Mrs. Bellane. The two verbally spar. He flees when Panteel returns and begins screaming for the police.
Later, Carla tells Neale what she has learned. The bookseller asks the couple to deliver some books in a suitcase since they are leaving. When they arrive at the address, they discover that no one lives there. Suspicious, Neale opens the suitcase. The bomb inside explodes, but Neale''s quick reaction saves them both.
Neale awakens in the hospital, the prisoner of Scotland Yard Inspector Prentice (Percy Waram). Neale persuades Prentice to search the bombed-out cottage for evidence. About to be taken to jail, at the last minute Neale finds a microfilm of military secrets inside a portion of the cake hidden in a bird''s nest. Officials insist that the top secret documents have only been taken out of a safe twice, the second time when Forrester''s tailor, a man named Travers, was present. Neale recalls that the empty flat was leased in Travers'' name.
Prentice and Neale go to the tailor''s shop, and find that Travers is Cost. Travers pretends not to recognize Neale, and calls a client about a suit. Then, seeing he is trapped, he commits suicide. When Neale dials the number he saw Travers use, Carla answers.
Neale slips away to confront Carla. Willi emerges, armed with a pistol, and admits he is the head of the spy ring. Another copy of the microfilm is sewn into the suit he received from Travers. Carla throws a candlestick, striking her brother''s gun hand. The two men struggle, and Carla picks up the gun. When she refuses to hand it over to Willi, he tries to flee, but she shoots him dead. Forrester and several other Nazi agents chase Neale and Carla onto the roof. Inspector Prentice arrives and kills the remaining Nazis.
Later, Carla and Neale drive in the country, talking about their wedding.  Neale is comically horrified when she mentions planning the "cake".','["Fritz Lang"]','["Seton I.

Years later in Rome, psychic medium Helga Ulmann (Macha Méril) holds a lecture in a theater where she senses that there is a killer in the audience that she cannot identify. Later that night, while Ulmann is in her apartment someone kicks the door in and murders her with a meat cleaver. Helga''s slaying is prefaced by a child''s doggerel song, which serves as the murderer''s calling card. British jazz musician Marcus Daly (David Hemmings), out drinking with his gay best friend Carlo (Gabriele Lavia), is walking home when he sees Helga being attacked through the window of the apartment building both live at. Marcus rushes inside to help, but he''s too late as she bleeds to death after her neck pierces the broken shards of a window.
After the police arrive, Marcus realizes he had seen a certain painting among a group of portraits on the walls of the victim''s apartment, which seems to have disappeared. Further complicating issues is the presence of female reporter Gianna Brezzi (Daria Nicolodi). Gianna has been sent to cover the murder and snaps a photo of Marcus, much to his annoyance. The next day, Gianna''s article on the murder is on the front page of the paper - complete with a photo of Marcus and a headline proclaiming him the chief witness to the murder. 
That evening, Marcus hears music playing in his house that he doesn''t recognize. Marcus barely escapes the murderer (who seeks to kill the "star witness") by locking himself in his study. Later, he plays the song to Professor Giordani (Glauco Mauri), a psychiatrist and boyfriend of Helga, who theorizes that the music is important because it played an integral part in a traumatic event during the killer''s past. Gianna (who is now following Marcus due to guilt about causing the killer to target him) hears about a folktale involving a haunted house in which a singing child is heard, followed by the shrieking of someone being murdered.
Investigating the source of the both song and folktale, the search leads Marcus and Gianna to a story from a book written by Amanda Righetti (Giuliana Calandra), titled House of the Screaming Child, which describes a long-forgotten murder. Marcus tries to find Amanda to talk to her about the book, but the unseen killer arrives at her villa first and kills Amanda by drowning her in a bathtub filled with scalding hot water. The dying Righetti manages to write a message on the wall of her steam-filled bathroom before expiring. The two find the body but are afraid that the police will think Marcus did it and leave without calling anyone. Thanks to a picture from the book, Marcus locates the house where the folktale originated and learns from the caretaker that no one has lived in the house since 1963, when the previous owner disappeared. Marcus searches the house by himself, removing plaster from a wall that uncovers a child''s drawing of a little boy holding a bloody knife next to a murdered man and a Christmas tree. Only after Marcus leaves the room, more plaster falls off, revealing a third figure in the drawing. Marcus confides in Carlos the information he has gathered in hopes that the native Italian might be able to provide more information on the drawing and the "House of the Screaming Child" urban myth. The drunken Carlo becomes aggressive with Marcus, demanding Marcus stop his investigations and just leave town with Gianna. 
Meanwhile, Giordani investigates the Righetti murder scene. On a hunch, he turns on the hot water in the bathroom and sees part of the message left on the wall by the murder victim. When Giordani returns to his office that night, he''s distracted by a mechanical doll toy someone has snuck into his office. The unseen killer then breaks in and fatally stabs him in the neck after bashing his teeth in on a mantelpiece/table. Marcus and Gianna (both of whom have fallen in love with each other by this point) also discover a clue that the former initially overlooked in the photo of the deserted house, realizing a window on one of the walls is missing. Marcus returns to the deserted house after dark and uses a pickaxe to knock down an end-wall in a hallway. Soon, he discovers a secret room with a skeleton by a Christmas tree. The unseen figure arrives and knocks Marcus unconscious. The house is set on fire, but Marcus is dragged out by Gianna.
Marcus and Gianna go to the caretaker''s house to call the authorities. There, Marcus discovers the caretaker''s young daughter Olga has drawn an identical drawing of the little boy with a bloody knife standing next to a murder victim. Olga tells them she copied the drawing from an old file in the archives at her junior-high school. Marcus and Gianna then break into the school to search the archives for this drawing. Marcus finds the painting, which has the name of Marcus''s friend Carlo on it. He looks for Gianna and finds she has been stabbed. Carlo suddenly appears before Marcus holding a gun and threatens to kill him for getting too close to the truth. Just as the police arrive, Carlo flees and climbs over a wall only to get hooked onto a rebar transported by a passing truck and is dragged down the street until he is gruesomely killed by having his head run over by a speeding car.
The case is apparently wrapped up with Carlo being the killer. After Marcus drops off the wounded Gianna at the hospital, he heads back to the scene of the crime. Suddenly, he realizes that Carlo couldn''t have killed Ulmann because they were together right before the murder took place, as well as seeing Carlo looking at the killer walking away. Marcus then enters the Ulmanns'' apartment and, after looking around, finally remembers what he saw that night in a mirror reflection, which he thought was a portrait, was the face of the killer. When he turns back, the killer appears in front of him, finally revealed to be Carlo''s insane mother, Martha (Clara Calamai). In a flashback to the Christmas scene, a young Carlo witnesses his mother stabbing her husband because he tried to have her committed to a psychiatric hospital. Carlo, traumatized, picks up the bloody knife and stares at it, then Martha entombs her husband''s body in a room of the house.
Martha confronts Marcus and tries to kill him by wielding a meat cleaver as she chases him out of the apartment to an elevator. He is then struck in the shoulder by the meat cleaver, but manages to kick Martha toward the elevator shaft. When the long necklace she''s wearing gets caught in the bars of the shaft, Martha is decapitated after Marcus pushes the elevator button. He is left staring into a deep red pool of Martha''s blood.','["Dario Argento"]','["Dario Argento","Bernardino Zapponi"]','["David Hemmings","Daria Nicolodi","Gabriele Lavia"]','["Horror","Mystery","Thriller"]','7.6','["tt0065143","tt0084777","tt0093677","tt0080923","tt0087909","tt0076786","tt0065761","tt0066735","tt0058567","tt0117658","tt0069019","tt0104053"]','["Horror;Profondo rosso;Movie Powder;avi"]','[{"url":"/DeepRed.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/DeepRed1975_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/DeepRed_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','DeepRed1975',178617,'Q1516994','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

('tt0022827','free','Doctor X (1932)','1932','1h 16min','Reporter Lee Taylor (Lee Tracy) is investigating a series of pathological murders that have taken place over a series of months in New York City. The murders always take place at night, under the light of a full moon, and each body has been cannibalized after the murder. Witnesses describe a horribly disfigured "monster" as the killer.
Doctor Xavier (Lionel Atwill) is called in for his medical opinion, but the police have an ulterior motive behind this: they wish to investigate Xavier''s medical academy, as the scalpel used to cannibalize the bodies of the victims is exclusive to that institution. Aside from Xavier, the other suspects are: Wells (Preston Foster), an amputee who has made a study of cannibalism; Haines (John Wray), who displays a sexual perversion with voyeurism; Duke (Harry Beresford), a grouchy paralytic; and Rowitz (Arthur Edmund Carewe), who is conducting studies of the psychological effects of the moon.
The police give Xavier 48 hours to apprehend the killer in his own way. During this time, Taylor investigates the doctor''s intentions and in the process, meets Joan Xavier (Fay Wray), the doctor''s daughter. Joan is exceedingly cold to Taylor, particularly after finding out that it was his story that pointed a finger at her father and ruined his first attempt at locating the killer. Taylor, however, takes a romantic interest in Joan.
At Xavier''s beach-side estate, all of the suspects gather for an unorthodox experiment: each member (excluding Wells, because it is known that the killer has two hands and he has but one) is connected to an electrical system that records his heart rate. When a re-enactment of the murder of a cleaning woman appears before them, the detector will expose the guilty man. Dr. Xavier''s butler and maid, Otto (George Rosener) and Mamie (Leila Bennett), carry out the reenactment.
During the experiment, a blackout occurs. When power is regained, it is discovered that Rowitz, whose monitor supposedly revealed him as the guilty party just before the blackout, has been murdered using a scalpel to the brain. Later that night, it is discovered that Rowitz''s body has been cannibalized.
The following evening, Xavier asks Otto and Mamie to re-enact another of the murders. Mamie is too frightened to play her part, so Joan takes her place. All of the men, save for Wells, are this time handcuffed to their seats. It is during this that we find out that it is, in fact, Wells who is the killer. After strangling Otto, Wells reveals to his handcuffed "guests" that he has invented a "synthetic flesh" composition, and has been creating artificial limbs and a horrific mask to carry out his crimes in order to collect living samples of human flesh for his experiments. Then, he declares his intention to collect Joan as his victim.
As Wells is about to strangle Joan, Taylor – concealed among a series of wax figures representing the killer''s victims – jumps Wells. After an extended fight, Taylor grabs a kerosene lamp and hurls it at Wells, setting him on fire. Wells crashes through a window and falls, in flames, down a cliff to the ocean shore. Reporting his story into the paper, Taylor tells his editor to make space in the marriage section for Joan and himself.','["Michael Curtiz"]','["Robert Tasker","Earl Baldwin"]','["Lionel Atwill","Fay Wray","Lee Tracy"]','["Comedy","Crime","Horror","Mystery","Sci-Fi","Thriller"]','6.4','["tt0031851","tt0024368","tt0026663","tt0023194","tt0027521","tt0026685","tt0028478","tt0023249","tt0024727","tt0024360","tt0024188","tt0023238"]','["trailer;horror;mystery"]','[{"url":"/DoctorX-Trailer_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/Trailer-DoctorX_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','DoctorX-Trailer',897,'Q1233890','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

However, he is continually reminded that he is still a boy, "tol''able" enough, but no man.
David eventually gets a chance to prove himself when outlaw Iscah Hatburn and his sons Luke and "Little Buzzard", distant cousins of the Kinemon''s Hatburn neighbors, move into the Hatburn farm, against the will of Esther and her grandfather.  Esther initially tells David not to interfere, saying he is no match for her cousins.  Later, the cousins kill David''s pet dog and cripple his older brother while the latter is delivering mail and taking passengers to town in his hack.  Out of a sense of honor, David''s father intends to visit vigilante justice on the Hatburn cousins rather than rely on the local sheriff, but is prevented by an abrupt and fatal heart attack.  David is determined to go after the Hatburns in his father''s place, but his mother pleads with him, arguing that he will surely die and that with his father dead and brother crippled, the household, including his brother''s wife and infant son, depends on him.  
The now fatherless Kinemon family is turned out of the farm and are forced to move into a small house in town.  David asks for his brother''s old job of driving the hack, but is told he is too young.  However, he does find work at the general store.  Later, when the hack''s regular driver is fired for drunkenness, David finally has a chance to drive the hack.  He loses the mailbag near the Hatburn farm, where it is found by Luke.  David goes to the Hatburn farm to demand the mailbag.  He is refused and gets into an argument with the cousins, during which he is shot in the arm.  David then shoots Iscah and the younger son and later, after a prolonged fight with the older brother (meant to recall the story of David and Goliath), emerges victorious.  Esther flees for help and makes it to the village, telling that David has been killed.

As the gang try to steal fruit from a fruit warehouse, Marty starts a fire to distract the watchmen, unfortunately it turns into a real blaze and he is caught by the police. Even though the police give him a rough time in questioning, he refuses to say the names of any other gang members, thus saving his friends and accomplices from capture. Marty is sent to a reformatory for delinquents.
Many years go by after that, and now Marty is the proud owner of the Cigarette Club, which is a cabaret and casino in Manhattan. In tending to his business, he sends men to strong-arm a customer reluctant to pay a gambling debt. The goons, Sam and Frank Diamond, beat the customer up, accidentally killing him. They try to make his death look as if a neon sign fell on him.
The police emergency squad investigating the death includes brothers Joe and Mike O''Mara, who graduated from Marty''s childhood gang. Authorities dismiss the death as an accident, but Joe, eager to become a police detective, believes it was murder when he finds evidence that the support that gave way allowing the sign to fall was clearly cut rather than breaking with age.
That evening there is a reunion dinner at Marty''s Cigarette Club, with the boyhood friends attending, including the O''Mara''s. Jerry Donovan is now a priest, and Helen McCoy has become a performer at the club. Helen has spurned Marty''s many proposals because she loves Mike O’Mara. Mike dances with Helen all evening.
Brother Joe, striking out with the ladies, exits the dinner, returns to the scene of the murder, impatient to solve the crime he believes was committed. Diamond and Sam, having realized he may expose them, corner him and push him off the roof to his death.
Later that evening, Marty arrives on the scene and is upset his incompetent thugs have perpetrated the murders. The homicide bureau dismisses Joe''s case as an accident, but Mike is unconvinced, and believes Joe''s death is connected to the previous one. He is also guilt stricken he didn''t accompany his brother to investigate his hunch on the incident that brought his death.
Diamond and Sam rob a jewelry store, set off a bomb next to Marty''s club, and send notes to Mike incriminating Marty. Mike takes the bait, loses control and tries to kill Marty, but Jerry stops him, and Mike is arrested. Marty refuses to press charges, and also confesses his involvement to Jerry. He explains to Jerry that he never intended any deaths to occur.
Diamond and Sam plan to rob the Polar Gardensa popular ice skating ring, and force Marty to participate through kidnapping Helen who wisely informs Jerry of where she is going. Diamond and Sam alert Mike of the plan who they hope will kill Marty. Mike again goes berserk, but Jerry again prevents Mike from killing Marty. In a shootout with the criminals, Marty dies taking a bullet intended for Mike. His death brings Mike and Helen together, and as Marty had requested, there is a playground built at Jerry''s boys club in Marty''s name.','["Ray McCarey"]','["Roy Chanslor","Borden Chase"]','["Victor McLaglen","William Gargan","Paul Kelly"]','["Crime","Drama"]','5.6','["tt0023935","tt0023117","tt0040472","tt0043390","tt0038409","tt0039101","tt0046001","tt0042313","tt0034637","tt0039372","tt0038126","tt0037749"]','["Crime; Drama"]','[{"url":"/the_devils_party.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/the_devils_party_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/the_devils_party_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','the_devils_party',35202,'Q7729941','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

A card with a large black ace (of spades) is put on his chest. Another “Black Ace” victim. The killer sends his victims a Black Ace card, warning them they are to die and then kills them, his way of taunting the police. Neil Broderick, an author, intends writing a book about him and is on his way to see Thornton Drake to get more information about him. Austin Winters is his secretary and Neil met his daughter Martha on the train, on the way to Chicago.
Drake has just received a Black Ace, with the words: “At seven tomorrow night”, the time he is to be killed. Two plainclothes cops arrive from police headquarters, having had a call, Clancy and Dugan (both incompetents). Martha suggests that they leave for Drake’s Louisiana plantation tomorrow morning and be far away from there at seven tomorrow night. Drake agrees and suggests they all go. On the flight, the lights go off for some seconds and when they come on again, Austin Winters is dead without a mark on him.
At the plantation, Clancy ineptly questions the suspects till Neil points out that they are now in another state, so out of their jurisdiction. Neil goes to another room and makes a phone call, then signals to someone outside. After he finishes his call, the line is cut. Meanwhile one of the pilots has taken off in the plane, leaving the other pilot, Henderson, behind who claims he does not know anything though he was out of the cockpit when Winters was killed.
The coroner finds a letter on the dead man which is to be read if Winters dies. It will reveal the identity of the Black Ace. Clancy starts reading it aloud and unsurprisingly the lights go off and the letter has vanished when the lights are turned on again. People locked in their rooms that night and Neil has a hidden car outside signal to him.
Later that night, the coroner turns up, the real one. Neil goes to Martha’s room and asks her what she did with the letter, guessing that she had taken it because was afraid her father might implicate himself with the Black Ace. The letter is gone from where she hid it and all there is, is two sheets of plain paper and a Black Ace card. Clancy and Dugan appear and blame Neil.  Clancy and Neil at gunpoint go to Drake’s room and while Clancy is hurling accusations, there is a groan from next door and they find a dead man there (Henderson). A search of Neil reveals he has a skeleton key so might have been able to enter the dead man’s room.
Downstairs, Dugan has been talking to Martha with his back to her, turns and sees she has gone (a mysterious hand reached out for her only moments before). The housekeeper (Mrs Quincy) is seen leading the fake coroner (Jerry Simons) who is carrying Martha. Drake left with Neil threatens him with a gun, demanding Winters’ confession but Neil has signalled Simons (of the Bureau of Criminal Investigations) who disarms Drake who has Winters’ confession implicating him. However, the gardener (Pompey) comes into the room with a gun in his hand and now the villains have the upper hand till there is a knock at just the right moment. Two fights ensue. In trying to kill Simons, Pompey kills Drake with the hidden spike in the walking stick. Pompey is subdued and the two cops arrive to take the credit.','["Ray Enright"]',NULL,'["Chester Morris","Vivienne Osborne","Frank McHugh"]','["Comedy","Crime","Drama","Mystery","Romance","Thriller"]','5.6','["tt0023385","tt0023479","tt0025163","tt0026895","tt0020668","tt0019630","tt0024217","tt0020686","tt0028367","tt0027466","tt0037554","tt0020744"]','["Mystery"]','[{"url":"/TomorrowatSeven.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/TomorrowatSeven_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/TomorrowatSeven_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','TomorrowatSeven',9404,'Q7820297','wp','["Ralph Spence"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

They approach an anomaly, identified as a "maggot hole". On the bridge of the C.P.P. Potkustartti, Captain James B. Pirk (Samuli Torssonen) reminisces about his experiences since the end of the previous film, Star Wreck V: Lost Contact. Pirk was stranded on Earth at the end of the 20th century, his spaceship destroyed, his crew dispersed to avoid changing Earth''s history.
Years later, Pirk realized that Earth''s history had not developed as expected since first contact with the Vulgars. Instead of helping Mankind to conquer space, the Vulgars were corrupted by rock star Jeffrey Cochbrane, who sold their spaceship to the Russians. Pirk takes matters into his own hands, and with his old crew members Commander Dwarf (Timo Vuorensola) and Commander Info (Antti Satama), he locates the spaceship of the Vulgars. Gaining the trust of the Russian President, he builds the spaceship C.P.P. Potkustartti and subsequently the "P-Fleet". Due to his monopoly on superior technology, Pirk takes control of the Earth and becomes its emperor.
Pirk desires further conquest. He takes the fleet through the maggot hole to a parallel universe, in which history has taken a different path. Pirk announces his intent to conquer the parallel universe to Captain Johnny K. Sherrypie, the commander of the Babel 13 space station. Sherrypie resists and sends his fleet to counter Pirk''s. Babel 13''s fleet is devastated. Sherrypie surrenders to the P-Fleet''s forces and lures Pirk and his security detail with promises of shore leave and sexual encounters with the Babel 13''s female personnel.
Sherrypie and his crew later try to assassinate Pirk, but he and his men escape. Battle resumes with the arrival of the Excavator, commanded by Festerbester. In a bitter fight, the P-Fleet suffers considerable losses, and the Excavator inflicts heavy damage on the Potkustartti. Crippled, the Potkustartti is set on a collision course, and the bridge personnel evacuate to Fukov''s ship, the C.P.P. Kalinka. The destructive force of the Potkustartti ramming the Excavator during a "twist core split" (a parody of Star Trek''s "warp core breach") destroys both ships. The remaining five P-Fleet ships approach Babel 13, preparing to destroy it, but Sherrypie''s security officer Mikhail Garybrandy (Jari Ahola) has primed the station''s reactor to blow up. The blast destroys the other ships, but the Kalinka escapes through the maggot hole, spiraling out of control and crashing into what appears to be ice age Earth. Pirk, Info and Dwarf beam down to safety as the ship crashes. The ending mirrors Pirk''s initial predicament: he is stranded without a ship during an uneventful time in history. Info suggests he go into power save mode and revive himself in the distant future to stop the fleet from entering the maggot hole. The scene shifts to Earth''s orbit where a cloud of high tech debris exists, suggesting that they are trapped in a post-apocalyptic future, not the prehistoric past.','["Timo Vuorensola"]','["Rudi Airisto","Samuli Torssonen"]','["Antti Satama","Tiina Routamaa","Samuli Torssonen"]','[""]','6.6','["tt10086816","tt1034314","tt6142094","tt0978717","tt3038708","tt0969670","tt1401143","tt0369131","tt0323551","tt0909388","tt0168123","tt0388318"]','["Finland; Scandinavia; Cult; Comedy; Parody; Sci-Fi; Science Fiction; Independent Film"]','[{"url":"/StarWreck.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/StarWreckInThePirkining_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/StarWreck_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','StarWreckInThePirkining',234340,'Q2005954','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

In Manieka, British East Africa, Bill Crawford (Bruce Cabot), District Commissioner, contacts the governor at Nairobi, requesting a month-long furlough to study the Senshi, a local tribe. His colleague, Lt. Roddy Turner (Reginald Gardiner), sends a message to the governor to cancel the furlough as the Senshi are becoming hostile. 
Two aircraft land at Manieka, bringing both rifles and Major Coombes (George Sanders), the Governor''s agent. Coombes tells Crawford that he is taking control of the outpost. When he finds Pallini (Joseph Calleia), officially an Italian prisoner of war, but unofficially the chef, Coombes wants Pollini put into restraints. He then asks Crawford why he wants a furlough, saying that someone is smuggling rifles to the Senshi.
Dutch engineer Jan Kuypens (Carl Esmond), working with the Italian government, is making a mineral survey of the area. Coombes suggests that Kuypens instead file his report with the British; he agrees.
A local trader named Abdi Hammud (Marc Lawrence) sets up an ambush of the British troops, but Crawford and his men are able to stop the attack. Zia, the daughter of the late Abu Kalli, who now runs the family network of trading posts in East Africa, arrives at the outpost. 
Pallini has known Zia for many years, and on Pallini''s birthday, the outpost decides to throw him a party. The men make sure they invite Zia, but when she arrives, she must sit at a segregated table because by native custom she is considered a half-breed. Crawford sits with her and discovers that she is African. 
The locals believe that one of the six white men will die that night. But there are only five of them at the party. When the white hunter, Dewey (Harry Carey), arrives, everyone else suddenly disappears. Two locals shoot at Crawford, but they miss, while Zia is grazed by a bullet. One of the attackers is killed and turns out to be the trader Hammud, responsible for the earlier ambush. 
The suspicious Coombes orders Zia to leave the outpost, despite her slight wound. Kuypens confronts Zia in her quarters, who quickly recognizes his German accent. Kuypens is a Nazi agent who is bringing in rifles to arm the Senshi. She agrees to go with him, but passes a warning message to Pallini to give to Crawford. Before Pallini is able to deliver it, Kuypens kills him. Pallini becomes the one (of the six) fated to die that night. 
The men find his body and Crawford decides to pursue Kuypens. Crawford confers with Dewey on where Kuypens will go. His rock samples, being volcanic, lead Crawford and Dewey to a geographic area they know. Their armed reinforcements follow shortly behind.
Zia is taken to a large cave complex where the rifles are being prepared. Crawford and Dewey find one of the arms stores and manage to blow up some rifles and ammunition. They also find the large cave complex; Dewey goes back to bring up their reinforcements.
Kuypens informs Zia that he knows that she is actually the daughter of Graham Fletcher, who, along with her mother, died when Zia was just two years old. Abu Kalli adopted her and raised her as an Arab. 
Crawford is captured, and is placed in a large cell with Zia, who tells him that the Senshi will attack Marieka the following day. Crawford suspects that she is working with Kuypens, but she finally convinces him that he is wrong. The two escape by tricking their guards, but a shoot-out between them, Kuypens, and the guards ends with Zia being captured. Crawford plays dead, then overpowers the guard sent to finish him off. 
Coombes and Dewey arrive with the British reinforcements, foiling the attack on Marieka. During the battle, Coombes is able to shoot Kuypens, but not before the Nazi agent fatally wounds him.
Later in London, Zia and Crawford are married before attending a large memorial service for Major Coombes. Afterward, they make their plans to return to Africa.','["Henry Hathaway"]','["Charles G.

The passengers include the Japanese Colonel Yamura, who is on his way to Manila to face war crime charges. Also on board is a couple, the Hartleys who were married on the day they were liberated from a Japanese prison camp.
During the flight, the colonel tricks a guard and breaks away from his guards, grabbing a gun and shooting a crew member and the co-pilot. The colonel struggles with Allen at the controls and causes the aircraft to plummet into the sea. Once the aircraft is declared missing, Air-Sea Rescue pilot Captain Jim Willis, Susan''s fiancé, begins a desperate search over the Pacific Ocean. He flies countless missions until, running a fever due to malaria, he is grounded.
The eight survivors of the crash have managed to inflate a life raft. After carefully assessing their situation, Allen, who has suffered a head wound, declares that they may have to attempt the 600-mile journey to the nearest island while hoping for rescue. In the first day at sea, Mrs. Hartley realizes that the amnesia victim, called Mr. Smith, is really her former husband, Philip Thompson, who was thought to be dead. The Hartleys now face a dilemma as they may not be married legally.
During the evening of the third day, Smith slips overboard without anyone noticing, but suspicion is cast on Mr. Hartley, who was supposed to be on watch. In the ensuing argument fomented by Yamura, the boat capsizes and the seven survivors fight for their lives in the ocean. After losing the sail and oars, the survivors realize that without food or water, their chances for survival are slim. When repairing a leak with chewing gum, Sergeant Blair is attacked by a shark, but Lt. Martin Pinkert jumps into the water to distract the shark and allow Blair to get back onto the raft.
On the fifth day, Susan discovers Allen is blind from exposure to the sun, and the two conspire to keep the raft drifting on course. Air-Sea Rescue is about to cancel further searches when Jim sneaks onto a Boeing SB-17G "Dumbo". He locates the survivors, dropping a motorized boat nearby, but the seven in the raft are too emaciated and weak to paddle to the boat. Jim parachutes into the water, inflates a small raft and then steers the rescue boat to the life boat, eventually bringing everyone on board to safety.
The rescue is complete when a Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boat airlifts the survivors back to their base. While Jim thinks that Susan has fallen in love with Allen, she reunites with him as they both bid Allen goodbye.','["William H.

('tt0044789','free','Kansas City Confidential (1952)','1952','1h 39min','A nameless, ruthless man (Preston Foster) who identifies himself as Mr. Big is timing to the minute the arrival of two trucks. One is an armored car routinely picking up bags containing lots of money from a bank. The other truck delivers to a flower shop next door.  The man''s timing shows that, for a very few minutes, the schedule of both trucks coincidentally parks them next to each other. He is casing the armored car. He needs a gang to help him rob it.  He selects three men for the gang—the addictive gambler Peter Harris (Jack Elam) wanted for murder, gum-chewing thug Boyd Kane (Neville Brand) and the womanizing Tony Romano (Lee Van Cleef). When interviewing them, he wears a mask so they cannot identify him. He has selected them because each has a reason for fleeing the US. They will fit perfectly into Mr. Big''s complex plan, which appears to be an ordinary robbery but is much more.
Part of his plan involves making an innocent patsy out of the floral truck driver and ex-con Joe Rolfe (John Payne), a look-alike getaway truck that the police will pursue instead of Mr. Big''s truck, to buy time to successfully escape the country. The robbery and pursuit go just as Mr. Big has planned. Each wearing a mask so none can identify each other, he and his gang arrive in a look-alike floral truck as Rolfe, unaware, drives away. Big and his gang subdue the armored car guards in four minutes, grab bags containing $1.2 million and flee, knowing that his distinctive getaway truck will be mistaken for Rolfe''s. Escaping, Mr. Big gives each gang member a torn king playing card.  He tells them “Hang on to those cards. We''ll cut up the money when I think it''s had time enough to cool off. I''ve got everything covered, but in case something does go wrong, and I can''t make the payoff myself, the cards will identify you to whoever I send with the money.” When the gang members object, Big tells them, intensely, “You can''t even rat on each other because you''ve never seen each other without those masks. I''ve made you cop-proof and stoolpigeon-proof and it''s going to stay that way. Keep those masks. You''ll be wearing them at the payoff.” The mystery man sends the other three to other countries to wait for the final payout.
As Mr. Big has planned, the police, brutal, corrupt and somewhat stupid, run down Rolfe and, wrongly concluding that since he''s an ex-con he must have been one of the robbers, submit him to third-degree grilling, but he maintains his innocence. Finally, he is released when his alibi checks out and the real getaway truck is found, and the bank''s insurance company tells him that, if he should happen to run across the stolen money, they will pay a 25% reward. As he''s released, Rolfe, a Bronze Star and Purple Heart-earning former Soldier accustomed to hardship, sees that he''s lost his job; he''s broke and everything he''s worked for since he got out of prison is ruined. After three weeks of unemployment and the prime suspect on the pages of every newspaper, he is at the end of his rope. He decides that, with nothing to lose, he will find the criminals and clear his name. Confiding his plan to a bartender friend with ties to the underworld, the friend tells of rumors that gambler Peter Harris, wanted and with no money or way of escape, suddenly has money and has fled the city. Believing Harris must be one of the robbers, Rolfe pursues him to Tijuana and looks for him in illegal gambling joints.
Finding Harris, Rolfe follows him to his hotel room and, finding the mask Harris wore, beats him into revealing the Mexican resort of Barados as the gang''s meeting place. He tells Harris, “I''m moving blind, but I got you for a bird dog to point the way as we go along.” At the airport, waiting for the flight to Barados, the police recognize Harris and, thinking he is reaching for a gun, kill him. Rolfe, not sure what to do next, realizes he can impersonate Harris when the airport clerk hands him Harris’ claim checks. In Harris’ luggage, he finds the mask and the torn playing card.
Arriving in Barados as Harris, Rolfe meets Kane, whom he identifies as one of the robbers because he chews gum constantly, and Romano, who Rolfe decides is a gang member because he has arrived almost simultaneously at the same time as Kane. Unknown to Rolfe, Mr. Big is there, too.  His name is Tim Foster, and a conversation with a friend, Scott the insurance investigator, reveals his reason for the robbery. Foster never intended for the three goons to split the money and get away with their shares. He was planning to spring a trap on them—as though he had solved the robbery himself—and so reclaim his job with the Kansas City police. His plan is to double-cross his gang, turn them and the money in, collect the 25% reward, and get his job back. The conversation reveals that he was a 20-year police captain who was forced to retire prematurely by political opponents.
But Foster''s plan suddenly is skewed when his daughter Helen (Coleen Gray) arrives unexpectedly. She meets Rolfe while registering for a bungalow and takes a liking to him. She''s studying law and ready to pass her attorney''s exam. She tells her father that, like a courtroom argument, she has presented his case of premature retirement to Kansas City''s mayor and the mayor has agreed to reconsider putting Foster back on the force. Foster, seeing his plan threatened, tells Helen he doesn''t want to return, but will consider her proposal. She then shocks him by telling that she''s met Peter Harris and likes him.
That night, in a poker game, Rolfe sits in and deliberately drops the torn king card, sarcastically saying, “My good luck piece. Souvenir of the biggest pot I ever sat in on.” Kane and Romano react, but Foster does not, because only he knows that the man pretending to be Harris, isn''t. Rolfe catches Romano searching his room and, after Rolfe beats him and he submits, the two men identify each other as gang members and agree to cooperate until the money is split.
In the meantime, Rolfe has met Helen and likes her. They tease each other, with Helen threatening to cross-examine him because he will not tell her much about himself. Later, Rolfe meets Foster and tells him he can''t join the poker game because he''s taking Helen to dinner.  Returning to his room, he''s beaten by Romano and Kane, who reveals he knows Rolfe is an imposter because he and the real Harris were in prison together. They are about to take Rolfe into the jungle to torture and possibly kill him when Helen knocks on the door and saves him.  Later, Foster appeals to Helen to forget Rolfe, but she refuses.
Foster is now ready to carry out the double-cross. He writes individual notes to Rolfe, Kane, and Romano to meet him on his boat, the Mañana, where the three will all coincidentally be, ripe for pickup by the police. Before that can happen, Kane and Romano try to ambush Rolfe, who gets the drop on them, admits he''s Rolfe, not Harris, and makes them believe he''s after Harris’ share. At the same time, Helen tells her father she knows Rolfe is in trouble. Once again, he fails to persuade her to stop seeing Rolfe.
Kane and Romano are not finished with Rolfe. They waylay Rolfe and discover he''s going to the boat. All three are driven there by Foster, who they still don''t know is Mr. Big.  On board the boat, Rolfe escapes and finds the stolen money in a cabinet. Romano, gun in hand, confronts him.  Rolfe shows him where the money is. Romano, greedy, kills Kane and is ready to take all the money and kill Rolfe, but Foster, trying to save his unraveling plan, intervenes. But he slips and reveals he is Mr. Big. In a resulting gun battle, Foster kills Romano but not before Romano shoots him. As Foster is dying, he tells Rolfe his one wish is that Helen doesn''t find out his duplicity. With his dying breath, he tells insurance investigator Scott that Rolfe deserves the 25% reward of $300,000.
Rolfe and Helen comfort each other after her father''s death. Later, Rolfe asks Scott how she''s taking it. Scott gestures at Helen and says meaningfully to Rolfe, “Why don’t you ask her?” She smiles in emotional release, and they kiss.','["Phil Karlson"]','["George Bruce","Harry Essex"]','["John Payne","Coleen Gray","Preston Foster"]','["Crime","Drama","Film-Noir","Thriller"]','7.4','["tt0045465","tt0047878","tt0040427","tt0041968","tt0042369","tt0043142","tt0045877","tt0046187","tt0045124","tt0041958","tt0038988","tt0044954"]',NULL,'[{"url":"/KansasCityConfidential1952-720p.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/KansasCityConfidential1952-720p_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/KansasCityConfidential720p_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','KansasCityConfidential720p',46998,'Q1056727','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

A traveling dentist calling himself Dr. "Painless" Potter visits the town, and McTeague''s mother begs Potter to take her son on as an apprentice. Potter agrees and McTeague eventually becomes a dentist, practicing on Polk Street in San Francisco.
Marcus Schouler brings Trina Sieppe, his cousin and intended fiancée, into McTeague''s office for dental work. Schouler and McTeague are friends and McTeague gladly agrees to examine her. As they wait for an opening, Trina buys a lottery ticket. McTeague becomes enamored with Trina and begs Schouler for permission to court Trina. After seeing McTeague''s conviction, Schouler agrees. Trina eventually agrees to marry McTeague and shortly afterwards her lottery ticket wins her $5,000. Schouler bitterly claims that the money should have been his, causing a rift between McTeague and Schouler. After McTeague and Trina wed, they continue to live in their small apartment with Trina refusing to spend her $5,000.

Schouler leaves the city to become a cattle rancher. Before he goes, he secretly, in order to ruin his former friend, reports McTeague for practicing dentistry without a license. McTeague is ordered to shut down his practice or face jail. Even though she has saved over $200 in addition to the original $5,000 from the lottery ticket, Trina is unwilling to spend her money. Money becomes increasingly scarce, with the couple forced to sell their possessions. McTeague finally snaps and bites Trina''s fingers in a fit of rage. Later, he goes fishing to earn money, taking Trina''s savings (now totaling $450).
Trina''s bitten fingers become infected and have to be amputated. To earn money she becomes a janitor at a children''s school. She withdraws the $5,000 from the bank to keep it close to her, eventually spreading it on her bed so she can sleep on it. McTeague then returns, having spent the money he took, and asks Trina for more. The following day McTeague confronts Trina at the school. After a heated argument McTeague beats Trina to death and steals her $5,000.
Now an outlaw, McTeague returns to Placer County and teams up with a prospector named Cribbens. Headed towards Death Valley, they find a large quantity of quartz and plan to become millionaires. Before they can begin mining, McTeague senses danger and flees into Death Valley with a single horse, the remaining money and one water jug. Several marshals pursue him, joined by Schouler. Schouler wants to catch McTeague personally and rides into Death Valley alone.
The oppressive heat slows McTeague''s progress. Schouler''s progress is also beginning to wane when he spies McTeague and moves in to arrest him. After a confrontation, McTeague''s horse bolts and Schouler shoots it, puncturing the water container. The water spills onto the desert floor. The pair fight one last time, with McTeague proving the victor; however, Schouler has handcuffed himself to McTeague. The film ends with McTeague left in the desert with no horse and no water, handcuffed to a corpse and unable to reach the remaining money.','["Erich von Stroheim"]','["June Mathis","Erich von Stroheim"]','["Gibson Gowland","Zasu Pitts","Jean Hersholt"]','[""]','8.1','["tt0013140","tt0015624","tt0018806","tt0018192","tt0015064","tt0014417","tt0015361","tt0018737","tt0006864","tt0019585","tt0019558","tt0065180"]','["pdmovies"]','[{"url":"/greed.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/greed1924_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/greed_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','greed1924',39712,'Q690583','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

After completing his college studies a few months later, Harold meets with Mr. Waggleberry at his advertising office for the job offer. Although Harold dreams of becoming an "ideas man," Waggleberry assigns him to a lowly position in the bookkeeping department.
Jumping forward 22 years later to the year 1945, the now middle-aged Harold, who has been stuck in his dull, dead-end book-keeping job, is let go by Waggleberry for old age and not being an ideas-man.

When Harold tells the bartender, Jake (Edgar Kennedy), that he has never had a drink in his life, the barkeep creates a potent cocktail he calls "The Diddlebock", one sip of which is enough to release Harold from all his inhibitions. The effects of the alcohol causes Harold to yowl uncontrollably. Gazing at himself in the bar mirror, Harold suddenly declares himself a loser and races out to remake himself. Soon Harold is getting his hair cut and his nails manicured at a local tailor shop and salon, and is trying on a gaudy plaid suit supplied by tailor Formfit Franklin (Franklin Pangborn). In the midst of his transformation, Harold overhears Wormy talking with his bookie Max (Lionel Stander), and impulsively bets $1,000 of his money on a 15-to-one long shot horse named Emmaline. To everyone''s surprise, Emmaline wins, and the now-rich Harold, with $15,000 in his pockets, begins to celebrate all around town on a day-and-a-half binge of spending, gambling, and carousing.
A few days later, Harold wakes up on the sofa inside the house of his widowed sister Flora (Margaret Hamilton) where she chastises him for his wild, irresponsible behavior. He finds that he has a hangover, but he also has a garish new wardrobe and a ten-gallon cowboy hat. Unable to remember much about his drunken binge, particularly about what he did on Wednesday which is a total blank, Harold wanders outside to return the plaid suit where he is surprised to learn that he now owns a hansom horse-drawn cab complete with an English driver named Thomas (Robert Greig). A worried Wormy then rushes up and informs Harold that, with winnings from a second bet, Harold also bought a bankrupt circus. After a meeting with the animal handlers and circus freaks, Harold first seeks help from the Kitt-Poo Home for Cats to feed the circus'' starving lions and tigers. Seeing no future with the ownership of the circus, Harold then gets the idea to sell the circus to a Wall Street banker.
Harold and Wormy visit the circus-loving Wall Street banker Lynn Sargent (Rudy Vallee) to ask him to purchase their circus, but he turns them down because he is trying to unload his own bankrupt circus. When the rest of the town''s bankers follow suit, Harold comes up with an idea. To get past the bank guards, Harold dresses up in his plaid suit and brings along Jackie, a tame circus lion, who incites panic. Carrying a filled Thermos, Wormy gives shot drinks of the potent "Diddlebock" cocktail to each of the bankers they visit so their inhibitions will fade and convince them to put in bids for ownership of the circus. Things take a turn for the worse when the lion gets loose, in which Harold, Wormy, and the lion end up on the ledge of a skyscraper, but narrowly avoid plunging to certain death.
According to Harold''s plan, the three (Harold, Wormy, and Jackie the Lion) are arrested and thrown in jail. Miss Otis bails them out the following day, and they find that the publicity has attracted a mob of bankers at the jail who want to buy the circus – but Ringling Brothers outbids them. Harold celebrates with another "Diddlebock", and again has another relapse. In the final scene, Harold wakes up another day or two later in the horse-drawn cab with Miss Otis where he learns that he received $175,000 for the sale of the circus, he is now an executive at Waggleberry''s advertising agency, and that he and Miss Otis are married. Reassuring Harold that she truly loves him, Miss Otis gives him a big kiss, and Harold finally remembers what he was doing all day on Wednesday. The final shot shows Wormy tagging along with them by riding on the back bumper of the cab.','["Preston Sturges"]',NULL,'["Harold Lloyd","Frances Ramsden","Jimmy Conlin"]','["Comedy"]','6.5','["tt0024961","tt0041165","tt0027969","tt0036891","tt0015002","tt0032338","tt0014945","tt0036880","tt0047921","tt0013075","tt0037077","tt0030631"]','["Comedy; Preston Sturges; Harold Lloyd"]','[{"url":"/harolddiddlebock_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/harolddiddlebock_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','harolddiddlebock',46746,'Q2364840','wp','["Preston Sturges"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

It pays homage to the Romanian troops who freed Bessarabia from the Red Army, which occupied it in 1940. The movie won the great prize at the Festival of Venice in 1942. It includes footage from contemporary newsreels, with refugee columns running away. 
Maria Cebotari played the role of Maria Teodorescu, an opera singer from Bessarabia, who is in Chisinau with her 8-year-old son at the time of the invasion. The boy is taken somewhere in Odessa. The mother is told that he will be maintained in a camp where he will be educated as a man and a Soviet. To get her son back she agrees to sing Russian songs in theaters and taverns. There, she shares pictures of her past. One such image is found by chance by her husband, who is in the Romanian army with the rank of captain. In the end, the family reunites.
Because of the invasion of Bucharest by Soviet troops in 1944 the movie was banned and the actors were arrested.  Many such movies were either destroyed or censored. Nothing was heard of this movie for more than 50 years. However, it was rediscovered in the Cinecittà archives in Rome and was shown for the first time in Romania in December 2006.','["Carmine Gallone"]','["Nicolae Kiritescu","Gherardo Gherardi"]','["Maria Cebotari","Carlo Ninchi","Filippo Scelzo"]','[""]','6.7','[]','["Odessa in fiamme;Odessa in fiamme 1942;Odessa in flacari; odessa in flacari 1942;catuse rosii; catuse rosii 1942;deportarea din Basarabia; republica moldova"]','[{"url":"/OdessaInFlacaricatuseRosii1942subtitrarePeFilm.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Odessa_in_flacari--Catuse_rosii--1942--Odessa_in_fiamme_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','Odessa_in_flacari--Catuse_rosii--1942--Odessa_in_fiamme',2229,'Q2054220','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

His mother Molly (Martha Wentwroth) then becomes distraught when she gets a letter from his "uncle" Pete Monahan (Noah Beery), a rancher friend of his late father, stating that he will soon visit them in New York. Molly explains to her only child that ever since his father lied to Pete that he had seven children, Pete has been sending birthday checks for each child. Pete is unaware that the McGinnises are so poor that they could never afford to return the checks.
Just then, Pete and his grown daughter Judy (Amelita Ward) ride up to the McGinnis apartment on horseback. Mugs declares that the rest of his supposed brothers and sisters are working at a defense plant, and later, forces his gang to pretend to be his siblings. Glimpy (Huntz Hall) is dressed up like a girl, and Scruno (Sammy Morrison), who is black, is introduced as an adopted child. Pete is delighted by the brood and takes them all out to a nightclub for fun.
The next day, local opportunist George Mooney (Rick Vallin) tells Pete that he is being duped by Mugs. Pete is offended when he learns the truth about the McGinnis brood, and tells Mugs to forget he ever had an uncle. The next day, Mugs and the gang go to the hotel to return the gifts and apologize to Judy, and learn that Pete has disappeared. When George, who has arranged Pete''s kidnapping, comes to the hotel for a visit, the boys hide in another room, but overhear him say that Pete has had an accident, and that he will take Judy to him.
Judy pockets her gun before she leaves with George, and East Side Kid Danny (Bobby Jordan) hops onto the bumper of George''s car. When the car stops, Danny gets off and calls Mugs to tell him the location of the kidnappers, but is then caught himself and held hostage along with Pete and Judy. The Cherry Street gang joins with the East Side Kids in fighting against the kidnappers, and when policeman Flanagan (J. Farrell McDonald) investigates the ruckus, he arrests the kidnappers.

('tt0036905','free','Hell-Bent for Election (1944)','1944','13min','The film is an allegorical campaign film, designed to inspire viewers to register and to vote for Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Democratic Party candidate, Roosevelt, is depicted as a modern streamlined steam train engine, the "Win the War Special", pulling a high-speed freight train of war materiel, whereas his Republican opponent Thomas E. Dewey is depicted as an old creaky steam train engine, the "Defeatist Limited" (numbered 1929 as a nod to the 1929 stock market crash) pulling cars variously representing hot air, high prices, taxes, business as usual (a sleeper car), poor housing for war workers, a hearse wagon for labor legislation, a small two wheel cart with just a few apples inside for unemployment insurance, and finally a caboose named "Jim Crow."The conflict in the film centers on Joe, a railroad switch operator who represents the American voting public. He is warned by the station master, Sam (a representation of Uncle Sam), not to fall asleep at the switch as he did in November 1942. Joe must then decide whether to listen to the influence of a cigar smoking gnome-like Dewey supporter and wrecker who tries to make him fall asleep at the switch, or to fight that influence and make sure that the Roosevelt "Win the War Special" stays on the track towards Washington. At one point, the phantasmagoric saboteur briefly metamorphosizes into Adolf Hitler whilst trying to beguile Joe into neglecting his duties. After a notable nightmare sequence, in which Joe fights his way through sales taxes (tacks), ''frozen'' wages, and rising prices (depicted by a boxcar always increasing in height so that he is never able to climb on to the roof), he pulls the switch to sideline the Defeatist Limited. The train tries to stop by running into reverse, which damages many of its cars, but when he is not able to slow down and hitting the switch which is against him, the train engine and his cars derail and crash. The "Win the War Special" advances down the track toward Washington, full steam ahead.
The film ends with a paean to the bountiful post-war world to come; the Win the War Special''s caboose is the "Post War Observation Car", and constituencies such as Joe Soldier, Joe Farmer, J. Industrialist, Joe Industrialist, Jr., and Joe Worker are shown examining fold-out brochures depicting the benefits of the American post-war world, including the benefits of the GI Bill and Social Security.','["Chuck Jones"]','["Robert Lees","E.Y.

While collecting aerial data on a United States Air Force (USAF) atomic blast at Soledad Flats, he loses control of his aircraft and crashes. He appears to have survived, unhurt, walking back to the air base with no memory of what happened. On his chest is a strange scar that was not there before the crash.
At the base hospital, Martin acts so strangely that the USAF brings in the FBI to investigate, thinking he might be an impostor. He is eventually cleared but told to take some time off. Martin protests being excluded from his project while on leave.
When an atomic test is set off without his knowledge, Martin steals the data, then goes back to Soledad Flats and places the information under a stone. An FBI agent follows him, but Martin is able to elude him until he crashes his car. Now back at the hospital, he is given truth serum. Deep under the drug''s influence, Martin tells a story about being held captive by space aliens, led by Denab, in their underground base. The aliens, with large, bulging eyes, are from the planet Astron Delta, ruled by a being called The Tala. They had revived his lifeless body as he had died in his aircraft.
The aliens plan to exterminate humanity using giant insects and reptiles, grown with the radiation absorbed from our own atomic bomb tests. Martin intuits that the aliens use stolen electric grid power to control their powerful equipment. This so that the A-bomb''s released energy levels can be predicted and then balanced. The aliens wiped his memory and hypnotized him into collecting the data for them.
The FBI agent (Steve Pendleton) and the base commander (James Seay) are skeptical of this incredible story and keep him confined at the hospital. Nevertheless, the attending physician says that Martin genuinely believes that what he told them is true.
With calculations made using a slide rule, Martin determines that if he shuts off the power to Soledad Flats for just 10 seconds, it will create an overload in the aliens'' equipment. So he escapes from the hospital and goes to the nearby electrical power plant, where he forces a technician to turn off the power. After 10 seconds, the alien base is destroyed in a massive explosion, saving the Earth from conquest.','["W.

However, at a New York City burlesque show, several protagonists are more intent on engagement in sexual pleasure, regardless of the subsequent costs. They include Paul''s own son Tom, burlesque dancer Sheila Wayne (who has syphilis), and two secretaries, lesbian Peggy and Betty, whom she is trying to seduce. However, one figure is not amongst them- Millicent Hamilton, a reformed former burlesque dancer. Millicent won a beauty contest in her hometown, which led her to New York, but a "casting couch" sexual encounter led her to contract syphilis. Millicent is told by her physician, Dr. Hamilton, that her condition can be cured, but only after slow, and painstaking treatment, and she should reject quack pseudo-cures. Millicent consents to this, eager to return to her home town and marry her boyfriend, Wendell- but will she heed the doctor''s warnings? And what will the consequences be if she does not?
Wild parties, lesbianism, and premarital sex are some of the forms of ''madness'' portrayed. The educational aspect of the film allowed it to portray a taboo subject which was otherwise forbidden by the Motion Picture Production Code of 1930, and its stricter version imposed by Hollywood studios in July 1934.','["Dwain Esper"]','["Joseph Seiden","Vincent Valentini"]','["Vivian McGill","Rose Tapley","Al Rigali"]','["Drama"]','2.6','["tt0026683","tt0028074","tt0041865","tt0025465","tt0121377","tt0028346","tt0028589","tt0046416","tt0121587","tt0029989","tt0204454","tt0121730"]','["exploitation;melodrama"]','[{"url":"/sex_madness.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/sex_madness_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/sex_madness_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','sex_madness',3207967,'Q135284','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Intended as a cinematic proof for the shared destiny of the German woods and the German people beyond the vicissitudes of history, it portrayed a perfect symbiosis of an eternal forest and a likewise eternal people firmly rooted in it between Neolithic and National Socialist times.
In accordance with Rosenberg''s anti-Christian beliefs, the first section on prehistory displayed various customs and rituals of an asserted pagan forest religion like a maypole dance or funerals in treetrunk coffins. Further, it depicted the forest sheltering ancient Germanic tribes, Arminius, and the Teutonic Knights, facing the German Peasants'' War, being chopped up by war and industry, and being humiliated by black soldiers from the French occupation army. The years of the Weimar Republic appeared to be disastrous for people and forest alike to legitimize the assumption of power and thus the film culminated in a National Socialist May Day celebration filmed at the Berlin Lustgarten.',NULL,'["Albert Graf von Pestalozza","Carl Maria Holzapfel"]','["Günther Hadank","Heinz Herkommer","Paul Klinger"]','[""]','5.3','[]','["Drittes;Reich"]','[{"url":"/1936-Ewiger-Wald_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/1936-EwigerWald-BedeutungDerNaturImDrittenReich54m19s416x320_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','1936-Ewiger-Wald',20665,'Q5419031','wp',NULL,'["Hanns Springer","Rolf von Sonjevski-Jamrowski"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

He admires and woos a young woman, Angela More (Mary Pickford). As she is celebrating her birthday on the Fourth of July of 1914, she receives flowers from the French Count Jules De Destin (Raymond Hatton). They are interrupted by Karl, who also gives her a present, and they compete for Angela''s favor. Karl is unexpectedly summoned to Hamburg to join his regiment, and Angela is crushed when he announces he has to leave. The next day, Angela reads in the paper the Germans and French are at war and 10,000 Germans have been killed already.
Three months pass by without a word from Karl. Angela is requested by her aunt in France to visit and take her to the USA. Word spreads that Germany will sink any ship which is thought to be carrying munitions to the Allies. Angela is aboard one of those ships when it is torpedoed, and saves herself by climbing onto a floating table, begging the attackers not to fire on the passengers. She is eventually rescued.
After weeks of ceaseless hammering from the German guns, the French fall back on Vangy, the home of Angela''s aunt. At the same time, Angela arrives at Chateau Vangy to visit her aunt, only to discover she has died. The Prussians are bombing the city and Angela is requested to flee. However, she is determined to stay to nurse the French wounded soldiers. A French soldier tries to help Angela escape, but she is unwilling to. He next asks her to let a French soldier spy on the Germans and inform the French via a secret hidden telephone. Angela is afraid, but gives them permission. The Germans attack the chateau and the remaining French soldier is killed.
German soldiers enter the chateau with the intention of getting drunk and enjoying themselves with the women who work there. After discovering the other young women, the Germans are intent on also raping Angela, who is the only person in the mansion not to be hidden. To save herself, she reveals herself to be a neutral American, but they are not interested in her nationality. Angela attempts to run away and hide, but is discovered by a German soldier who turns out to be Karl. Angela begs him to save the other women in the house, but Karl responds he cannot give orders to his superior officer, who says his men deserve their ''relaxation''. She realizes there is nothing she can do. With permission to leave the mansion, she witnesses the execution of French civilians. She is heartbroken and decides to go back for revenge.
Angela secretly calls the French with the hidden telephone and describes three gun positions near the chateau. The French prepare themselves and attack the Germans. The Germans realize someone is giving the French information and Karl catches Angela. He tries to help her escape, but they are caught. The commander orders that Angela be shot as a spy. When Karl tries to save her, he is sentenced to be executed for treason. As the couple face death, the French shell the chateau, enabling Angela and Karl to escape. They are too weak to run and collapse near a statue of Jesus in the ruins of a church. The next day, they are found by French soldiers. They initially want to shoot Karl, but Angela begs their commander, Count De Destin, to set him free.

His mysterious employer, estate agent Herr Knock, sends Hutter to Transylvania to visit a new client named Count Orlok who plans to buy a house in Wisborg. Hutter entrusts his loving wife Ellen to his good friend Harding and Harding''s sister Annie, before embarking on his long journey. Nearing his destination in the Carpathian Mountains, Hutter stops at an inn for dinner. The locals become frightened by the mere mention of Orlok''s name and discourage him from traveling to his castle at night, warning of a werewolf on the prowl.
The next morning, Hutter takes a coach to a high mountain pass, but the coachman declines to take him any further than the bridge as nightfall is approaching. A black-swathed coach appears after Hutter crosses the bridge and the coachman gestures for him to climb aboard. Hutter is welcomed at a castle by Count Orlok. When Hutter is eating dinner and accidentally cuts his thumb, Orlok tries to suck the blood out, but his repulsed guest pulls his hand away.

Hutter wakes up to a deserted castle the morning after and notices fresh punctures on his neck which, in a letter he sends by courier on horseback to be delivered to his devoted wife, he attributes to mosquitoes. That night, Orlok signs the documents to purchase the house across from Hutter''s own home in Wisborg and notices a photo of Hutter''s wife, remarking that she has a "lovely neck."
Reading a book about vampires that he took from the local inn, Hutter starts to suspect that Orlok is Nosferatu, the "Bird of Death." He cowers in his room as midnight approaches, but there is no way to bar the door. The door opens by itself and Orlok enters, his true nature finally revealed, and Hutter hides under the bed covers and falls unconscious. At the same time this is happening, his wife awakens from her sleep, and in a trance walks towards the balcony and onto the railing. Alarmed, Harding shouts Ellen''s name and she faints while he asks for a doctor. After the doctor arrives, she shouts Hutter''s name, remaining in the trance and apparently able to see Orlok in his castle threatening her unconscious husband. The doctor believes this trance-like state is due to "blood congestion".
The next day, Hutter explores the castle. In its crypt, he finds the coffin in which Orlok is resting dormant. Hutter becomes horrified and dashes back to his room. Hours later from the window, he sees Orlok piling up coffins on a coach and climbing into the last one before the coach departs. Hutter escapes the castle through the window, but is knocked unconscious by the fall and awakens in a hospital.
When he is sufficiently recovered, he hurries home. Meanwhile, the coffins are shipped down river on a raft. They are transferred to a schooner, but not before one is opened by the crew, revealing a multitude of rats. The sailors on the ship get sick one by one; soon all but the captain and first mate are dead. Suspecting the truth, the first mate goes below to destroy the coffins. However, Orlok awakens and the horrified sailor jumps into the sea. Unaware of his danger, the captain becomes Orlok''s latest victim when he ties himself to the wheel. When the ship arrives in Wisborg, Orlok leaves unobserved, carrying one of his coffins, and moves into the house he purchased. The next morning, when the ship is inspected, the captain is found dead. After examining the logbook, the doctors assume they are dealing with the plague. The town is stricken with panic, and people are warned to stay inside.
There are many deaths in the town, which are blamed on the plague. Knock, who had been committed to a psychiatric ward in care of Professor Sievers, escapes after murdering the warden. The townspeople give chase, but he eludes them by climbing a roof, then using a scarecrow. Meanwhile, Orlok stares from his window at the sleeping Ellen. Against her husband''s wishes, Ellen had read the book he found. The book claims that the way to defeat a vampire is for a woman who is pure in heart to distract the vampire with her beauty all through the night. She opens her window to invite him in, but faints. When Hutter revives her, she sends him to fetch Professor Bulwer, a physician. After he leaves, Orlok comes in. He becomes so engrossed drinking her blood that he forgets about the coming day. Knock, who has been recaptured, senses what is happening to Orlok (who is evidently his master), but is restrained from breaking out of his cell to warn him. When a rooster crows, Orlok vanishes in a puff of smoke as he tries to flee, which Knock senses as he quietly dies. Ellen lives just long enough to be embraced by her grief-stricken husband. The last scene shows Count Orlok''s ruined castle in the Carpathian Mountains, symbolizing the end of his reign of terror.','["F.W.

Archeologists tell us they are the remains of a once great temple, abandoned by the Aztecs when they migrated south to the Valley of Mexico, where they founded a rich empire. To defeat the greed of Cortez and his Spanish adventurers who had inaugurated a campaign of loot and murder, the wiley Emperor Montezuma hid his fabulous treasure far to the north and implored his native gods to guard it. Among these gods was the feathered serpent---Quetzalcoatl."The first scene shows Dr Forbes (George Zucco) driving to the cave in which Quetzalcoatl lives. Here he taunts the serpent and, in doing so, explains that Quetzalcoatl has guarded Montezuma''s treasure for 300 years. The creature has been imprisoned behind bars by Dr Forbes; it is revealed that this has been the case for 5 years. Forbes takes a feather from Quetzalcoatl and antagonises the beast, remarking that it will kill to have its feather back.
In the next scene, Forbes pretends to unintentionally give the feather to Dr. John Lambert by dropping it on the ground. Lambert, who has recently written an article entitled, "Aztec carving of the legendary bird Quetzalcoatl.", recognises the feather and acknowledging its worth, keeps it. Forbes returns to the cave and releases Quetzalcoatl which then flies in search of its feather. The beast finds Lambert, who by this point has left his office, it kills him, and returns to its cave. 
It is revealed that Richard Thorpe (Ralph Lewis) will be undertaking an investigation into the death of Dr. Lambert. Upon hearing this Forbes resolves to plant a feather on Thorpe in order to have him killed. In conducting his investigation Thorpe brings up the point that Forbes'' late wife died under similar circumstances to Lambert, suggesting that the two murders may be linked and that Forbes may be implicated in them. Forbes plants the feather with the hope that Thorpe will take it, however, Sheriff Bill Hayes (Henry Hall) spots it first and retrieves it.

('tt0047507','free','The Snow Creature (1954)','1954','1h 9min','The film has a two-act structure, the first act taking place in the exotic locale of the Himalayas and the second occurring in Los Angeles, California.  While the first act takes place in an undisclosed Himalayan country (presumably bordering India) the actors portraying the locals speak Japanese. The movie starts with a scientific expedition intent on collecting botanical samples, led by Dr. Frank Parrish (Paul Langton) and encounters difficulties when the wife of the expedition''s chief guide is kidnapped. The guide, a sherpa named Subra (played by Teru Shimada), seizes the expedition''s guns and takes control of the team when he is unable to convince Parrish to pursue the Yeti and save his wife. Parrish, a man of science, is skeptical of the Yeti''s existence, but is forced to participate in Subra''s march.  Along with his fellow westerner (a photographer named Peter Wells, played by Leslie Denison), Parrish awaits his opportunity to overthrow the renegade sherpa.  However, as the team draws closer to the Yeti, evidence emerges that begins to change Parrish''s opinion regarding the creature''s existence (such as the tell-tale “giant footprints”).  Finally, the team makes contact with the snow creature, who hurls stones at them from atop his mountain refuge.  The expedition tracks the creature to his cave, where they encounter the creature, along with two other Yetis - a female and young one.  The team also discover Subra''s wife, who is guarded jealously by the snow creature.  Parrish forcibly prevents the enraged Subra from shooting the Yeti, reasoning that the creature is more valuable for science alive.  This delays the capture long enough to enable the creature to create a cave-in (presumably to keep his family safe from the humans).  However, the cave-in works against the Yeti, killing the female and young Yetis and knocking the snow creature himself unconscious.  The cave-in also enables Parrish and Wells to take control of the sherpa''s guns.  Having regained control over the expedition, and successfully capturing a live Yeti, Parrish declares that he is intent upon bringing the creature to the U.S. where it will be studied.
The Yeti is eventually sedated and placed in a telephone booth-sized freezer for transport.  Locked inside this freezer, the Yeti is transported to Bombay and thence to California.  In an odd geographic twist, the return flight heads west from India to California (via TWA) – beginning the second act.  Upon reaching Los Angeles, Parrish is greeted by reporters who have been made aware of the creature''s existence.  A U.S. Customs official informs Parrish that the admission of this creature to the U.S. has been made difficult by a newspaper article published by Peter Wells that refers to the creature using the term “man”.  The issue is raised whether the snow-creature is actually human and the officials decide to keep the creature in quarantine until an anthropologist can determine the question of the creature''s humanity.  It is during this delay at the airport''s customs station that the snow creature manages to escape the ice box (which was apparently meant to confine him temporarily only).  The snow creature roams the city, terrorizing a woman and finding refuge in the cool temperature of the city''s sewers as well as meat-lockers (where it can also feed).  The police, aided by Parrish, manage to track the Yeti through the sewer system to where the creature is caught in a net and grabbed by 5 men.  As the creature resists it starts to choke one of the men through the mesh.  One of the men shoots the creature once who then stops choking the man.  There''s a pause after the choked man had been released and then the man with the gun decides to shoot the rare creature with three more slugs just for good measure. Thus, one of the greatest finds of all time is dead.','["W.

('tt0037547','free','Blood on the Sun (1945)','1945','1h 38min','In 1929, the existence of the “Tanaka Memorial,” a Japanese plan devised by Baron Giichi Tanaka (John Emery) to conquer the world, is published in the Tokyo Chronicle. The Japanese secret police visit the Chronicle’s headquarters, interrogating editor Nick Condon (James Cagney) about the source, which he refuses to disclose. Intrigued at the heavy-handed response to the rumor, Condon assigns Ollie Miller (Wallace Ford), a Chronicle reporter, to further research the plan.
Some time later, Ollie and his wife Edith (Rosemary DeCamp) make plans to leave Japan on a ship. Believing he discovered the details of the plan, the secret police arrange to have him killed. When Condon goes to his cabin on the ship, he finds Edith strangled, and narrowly misses another woman exiting the cabin; he glimpses a ruby ring on her hand. Later that night, Ollie is shot outside Condon’s house. Before he dies, he gives to Condon a copy of the Tanaka Memorial plan. As the secret police, led by Captain Oshima (John Halloran), arrive, Condon hides the document behind a portrait of Emperor Hirohito. Revering the portrait, Oshima does not search it, but ransacks the rest of his house and subdues him when he resists.
Condon wakes the next morning in a prison cell. The Japanese police have fabricated a story about him having a drunken party the previous night and fixed his house to hide the damage, and the document is missing. Condon’s search for it is interrupted by a courier inviting him to Baron Tanaka’s home. At Tanaka’s home, the Baron subtly threatens Condon to return the document, and Condon realizes that Tanaka does not have it and someone else took it.
Suspecting that the other party consists of Japanese anti-war liberals interested in sneaking the document out of the country, Condon publicly announces his intention to return to the United States. That evening, he meets Iris Hilliard (Sylvia Sidney), a half-Chinese woman. Seeing a ring on her finger, he suspects she was the woman he saw fleeing Edith’s cabin, but the two are attracted to one another. Unbeknownst to him, Iris is a spy for Baron Tanaka, tasked with retrieving the plan.
Disgruntled at being passed over as Condon’s replacement as editor, Cassell (Rhys Williams), an unscrupulous reporter, inadvertently reveals that Tanaka ordered him to introduce Iris to Condon. Armed with this knowledge, Condon confronts Iris, who confesses that, while she works for Tanaka, she is loyal to Japan’s liberal faction and, having no fear of the Emperor’s portrait, she herself took the Tanaka Memorial from his house. Condon takes the document and leaves. Eavesdropping on their conversation, the secret police imprison Iris, but she escapes. Disgraced by his failure, Tanaka commits seppuku.
Before Condon leaves for the United States, Iris contacts him, asking to meet on a fishing dock. Evading the secret police tailing him, Condon meets her on the dock. She is accompanied by Prince Tatsugi (Frank Puglia), a liberal within the Japanese government. Aware that the government will claim the document is a forgery, Tatsu places his seal on it, legitimizing it. The police arrive and kill Tatsugi; Condon gives the document to Iris, who flees in a fishing boat, and stays behind to delay the policemen.
Defeating Captain Oshima at judo and evading the secret police, Condon arrives outside the embassy. He is shot and incapacitated, but when the Japanese search him, they are unable to find the document. As an American diplomat arrives to help Condon, the head of the secret police asks him to forgive his enemy. As he enters the embassy, Condon replies, “Sure, forgive your enemies – but first, get even!”','["Frank Lloyd"]','["Lester Cole","Nathaniel Curtis"]','["James Cagney","Sylvia Sidney","Porter Hall"]','["Drama","Romance","Thriller","War"]','6.1','["tt0036057","tt0038279","tt0042249","tt0053272","tt0034578","tt0042648","tt0037449","tt0035612","tt0027697","tt0035153","tt0029588","tt0031260"]','["Action; Drama; War; Romance; James Cagney"]','[{"url":"/BloodontheSun.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/BloodontheSun_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/BloodontheSun_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','BloodontheSun',265774,'Q3040419','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

There enters a traveler, slightly intoxicated, accompanied by a porter, who carries his baggage. The traveler takes off his hat, his coat and his shoes. The servant places these things upon a clothes-rack in such a way that they resemble the outlines of the back of an old codger. The servant withdraws. A comedic scene follows when the drunken chap tries to light his pipe from a candlestick. The candlestick rises in the air, and the flame is put out by a portrait placed in a frame on the wall. The guest lights the candle, and he tries to light his pipe again. A second time the candlestick rises up, and the personage in the picture having become animated swallows candle and candlestick. The fellow jumps backward, bumps up against the clothes-rack. Taking his clothes for an intruder he kicks at them. The boots become animated, and kick him in return. The fellow, enraged, throws himself upon the clothes-rack, which he imagines to be a person, struggles with it and rolls upon the floor, entangled among all his clothes.
He restores everything to its former place, but his boots began to dance about the room. The poor drunk man chases after them, but the boots ascend the wall and disappear in the ceiling. 
Tired he goes to bed. Immediately the bed begins to dance wildly about the room, then falls upon him, burying him among the covers, mattress and the pieces of the bed. He extricates himself in a rage, restores everything to order again, but just as he attempts to get into bed he finds himself suddenly thrown under it.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police assures the United States Treasury officials that they will cooperate fully in helping to apprehend the criminals. RCMP Constable MacDonald is sent out to assist in the investigation. While riding near Deer Lake, he sees a suspicious Indian rowing a canoe. When he calls to him, the Indian flees into the woods. MacDonald investigates the strange block of ice left behind and soon discovers the counterfeit money hidden inside the frozen trout. The Indian Pierre, who works for the counterfeiters, sees what has happened and kills MacDonald with a deadly throw of a knife.
Meanwhile, RCMP Sergeant Renfrew (James Newill) arrives with his men at the Deer River Annual Picnic where he competes against the Greek owner of the Totem Pole Lodge George Poulis (William Royle) to see who makes the best barbecue sauce. Renfrew meets nineteen-year-old American Virginia Bronson (Carol Hughes) and invites her to join the picnic festivities and barbecue. Their fun is interrupted by news of the killing of Constable MacDonald. Later Inspector Newcomb challenges his men to do everything they can to bring the killers to justice. That night Renfrew comforts MacDonald''s grieving family, especially his son Tommy (Dickie Jones).
At the Deer River Hotel, Virginia returns to her room and finds Pierre, who gives her a note from her father asking that she meet him at the Totem Pole Lodge. Unknown to her, Virginia''s father was tricked into coming to the lodge, which is being used as a center of operations for the counterfeiters, to provide new counterfeit plates for the gang. Bronson, who was once a counterfeiter, just returned from serving a five-year sentence in prison. The next day, while Virginia and Pierre are rowing to the lodge by canoe, the Indian spots Renfrew following them. When he reaches for his rifle, Virginia struggles to take away the gun and the two end up in the water. Renfrew jumps in after them and is able to rescue Virginia, but Pierre manages to escape.
While they dry off around a campfire, Renfrew and Virginia get to know each other. While attracted to the Mountie, Virginia discovers her father''s picture in his possession and does not mention that he is staying at the Totem Pole Lodge. Later that night while Renfrew is asleep, Pierre shows up and Virginia sneaks away with him to the lodge. Meanwhile, her father is being forced to complete a set of counterfeit plates. He finally meets the head of the counterfeit gang—the Greek lodge owner, George Poulis.
Meanwhile, Pierre and Virginia make their way slowly to the lodge. On the road they''re met by two of Poulis'' thugs, and Virginia tells them they are being pursued by an officer named Renfrew. Shortly thereafter, the two thugs encounter Renfrew and try to kill him, but the Mountie and his trusted dog Lightning are able to disarm the criminals and arrest them. When Renfrew examines their new counterfeit bills, he discovers a secret message from Bronson etched in the bill''s design indicating that he is being held prisoner at the Totem Pole Lodge.
Soon after, Renfrew obtains an aircraft, flies over the Totem Pole Lodge, and parachutes down to the lodge property. Poulis is surprised to see his "friend" and offers him a room. Later when Renfrew sees suspicious men loading up a car with blocks of ice, he chases after them on motorcycle.

('tt0014538','free','Three Ages (1923)','1923','1h 3min','Three plots in three different historical periods—prehistoric times, Ancient Rome, and modern times (the Roaring Twenties)—are intercut to prove the point that man''s love for woman has not significantly changed throughout history. In all three plots, characters played by the small and slight Buster Keaton and handsome bruiser Wallace Beery compete for the attention of the same woman, played by Margaret Leahy. Each plot follows similar "arcs" in the story line in which Keaton''s character works for his beloved''s attention and eventually wins her over.
In the Stone Age story line, Keaton competes with the bigger, brutish Beery for a cavewoman Leahy. After observing another caveman drag away a woman by the hair in order to "claim" her, Keaton tries to become more assertive, but is continuously pushed back and bullied by Beery. An attempt to make Leahy jealous by flirting with another woman ends in failure. Nevertheless, Keaton grows closer to Leahy, and Beery challenges him to a fight at sunrise. Keaton wins thanks to hiding a rock in his club, but is caught and tied to the tail of an elephant to be dragged around the dirt as punishment. Upon his return, he finds Leahy about to be claimed by Beery and attempts to make off with her. Beery catches him and the two battle by tossing boulders at each other from afar, with Keaton and Leahy on a cliff together. When Beery climbs up to reclaim Leahy, Keaton dispatches Leahy''s cronies and finally defeats him. He drags a smitten Leahy off by the hair. In the epilogue, they go off for a walk with their huge family of children following them.
In the Ancient Rome segment, Keaton attempts to attract the attention of the wealthy Leahy, but is continually pushed back by Beery. Beery challenges him to a chariot race after a hard snow — Keaton wins by using sled dogs instead of horses. In revenge, Beery forces him into the lion pit belonging to Leahy''s family. Keaton survives by befriending the lion and manicuring its claws. Keaton is rescued by Leahy''s parents while Beery kidnaps Leahy. Keaton rescues her and tries to seduce her in her palanquin, which takes off without them. In the epilogue, they also go out for a walk with many children in tow.
In the "modern times" story line, Keaton is a poor man yearning for Leahy, who has rich parents. Leahy''s mother, unimpressed with Keaton''s bank account but interested in Beery''s, decides on Beery as a match for her daughter. Keaton accidentally gets drunk at a restaurant where Beery and Leahy are dining, and Beery tricks the male half of another couple into punching Keaton, who stumbles home drunk. Later, Keaton impresses Leahy by playing a football game, whereas Beery is only a coach; Beery decides to play opposite Keaton. Keaton is overwhelmed by the bigger Beery, but ends up winning the game with an impressive touchdown. An irritated Beery frames Keaton for possession of alcohol and gets him arrested, simultaneously showing him a wedding announcement between him and Leahy — Keaton will be unable to stop the wedding while in jail. While shadowed by a guard, Keaton finds a criminal file showing that Beery has been charged with bigamy and forgery. He attempts to call Leahy to warn her. He accidentally escapes when the phone booth he''s using is taken out for replacement. Keaton evades the police chasing him and makes it to the church in time to drag Leahy away from the wedding and into a cab. After showing her Beery''s criminal file, he takes Leahy home and prepares to leave, but she kisses him. He declares to the cab driver that they''re going back to the church. In the epilogue, they also go out for a walk — this time with their dog instead of children.',NULL,'["Clyde Bruckman","Joseph A.

Later on Earth, a Boy Scout troop is visiting an aquarium to see the scientists working on a small two-man submarine. Masao and Jim, two of the scouts, manage to talk their way aboard the sub. While in the water they spot Gamera, who engages in a little race with the boys. However, their hijinks come to an end when the second alien vessel envelops the both of them in a super-catch ray. Gamera helps the boys to escape, but he remains trapped in the force field while the aliens scan his memories. They learn of Gamera''s one weakness, his soft spot for children. Soon after, the field weakens and Gamera is free. The aliens capture Jim and Masao, threatening to kill the boys. Powerless to help them, Gamera lands. Attaching a brainwave control device to Gamera''s head, the aliens force the turtle kaiju to do their bidding.
While aboard the spaceship, the boys continually try to escape. Gamera, however (under the influence of the aliens), is destroying dams and cities by the handful. Jim and Masao discover a squid-like creature, thinking that he is another captive of the aliens. In fact, he is the leader of the aliens. The boys help Gamera break free from the brainwave device and he begins to attack the spaceship. Grounded by Gamera, the aliens reveal that their human forms were just disguises. The aliens all merge to form the giant monster Viras.  Gamera and Viras duke it out in a big beachside battle. Gamera manages to pull Viras into the upper atmosphere, freezing him to death.

('tt0052602','free','The Bat (1959)','1959','1h 20min','Cornelia Van Gorder (Agnes Moorehead) is a mystery author who rents a summer home in a small town from local bank president John Fleming (Harvey Stephens). Over $1 million in negotiable securities is discovered missing from the bank while Fleming is on a hunting trip with his physician, Dr. Malcolm Wells (Vincent Price). In a cabin in the woods, Fleming confesses to Wells that he stole the securities. He offers to split the money with Wells in return for help faking his own death and threatens to kill him if he doesn''t agree to help. When a forest fire breaks out nearby, Wells shoots Fleming and uses the fire to cover up the murder.
Meanwhile, the town is being terrorized by a mysterious murderer known as "the Bat". The Bat is said to be a man with no face who murders women at night by ripping out their throats with steel claws. Van Gorder''s maid Lizzie (Lenita Lane) tells her that most of the household servants have quit in fear of the Bat. As they lock up the house, Lizzie sees the Bat''s clawed hand reaching through an unlocked door. Van Gorder calls the police, who promise to send officers to investigate. The Bat breaks into the house and releases a bat, which bites Lizzie. Lizzie fears she may have contracted rabies. Van Gorder calls for Dr. Wells to treat the bite.
Wells is in his laboratory, doing experiments on bats. The local chief of detectives, Lieutenant Andy Anderson (Gavin Gordon), is watching through a window. When Wells leaves to answer Van Gorder''s call, Anderson breaks into the laboratory and searches it. Wells checks Lizzie''s wound and catches the bat that bit her. Anderson arrives shortly after and says an officer will watch the house for the rest of the night.
Van Gorder is visited by Wells, Dale Bailey (Elaine Edwards), and Judy Hollander (Darla Hood). Dale''s husband, Victor Bailey (Mike Steele), is a clerk at the bank and a suspect in the theft of the securities; Judy works at the bank and is a witness in his defense. While Anderson is visiting Mark Fleming (John Bryant), the nephew and heir of John Fleming, Van Gorder has Dale call him about blueprints that may show a hiding place in the house. He promises to help her look for them that evening. While Van Gorder, Judy, and Dale are having dinner, Mark sneaks into the house to look for the blueprints on his own. The Bat kills him and takes the blueprints. Anderson and Wells (who is the local coroner) arrive to investigate the murder. Anderson questions the women and Van Gorder''s new butler, Warner (John Sutton). Anderson tells the women to lock themselves into their rooms for the rest of the night; he will stay to watch for the Bat.
After the women go to bed, Anderson goes into the woods behind the house with a flashlight; Warner follows him. Soon after, the Bat enters the house again. He cuts the phone line and goes to the third floor, where he begins chiseling a hole one of the walls. Hearing the noise from his chiseling, Dale and Judy go to investigate. The Bat kills Judy and flees the house. Anderson returns, saying he saw a man in the woods. He accuses Warner, whom he recognizes as a suspect for a robbery in Chicago. Warner says he was acquitted. Wells comes to the house, saying he had an accident in his car nearby; Anderson casts suspicion on him as well.
Van Gorder investigates the room the Bat was in, and realizes there is a secret room behind the wall where he was chiseling. She accidentally traps herself in the room, but is freed by Detective Davenport (Robert Williams), the officer assigned to watch the house that evening. Meanwhile, the Bat kills Wells in his laboratory and leaves a fake suicide note to frame Wells as the Bat. The Bat returns to Van Gorder''s house, where he sets the garage on fire to draw the occupants outside. Van Gorder sees through this ruse; she has Dale, Lizzie, and Davenport hide and wait for the Bat. When confronted, the Bat shoots Davenport and is about to kill the others, when Warner returns and shoots him. Warner unmasks the Bat, who is revealed to be Lieutenant Anderson.','["Crane Wilbur"]','["Crane Wilbur","Crane Wilbur"]','["Vincent Price","Agnes Moorehead","Gavin Gordon"]','["Horror","Mystery","Thriller"]','6.1','["tt0016629","tt0051744","tt0038937","tt0053363","tt0053925","tt0058700","tt0057128","tt0056993","tt0045888","tt0059821","tt0055304","tt0047200"]','["mystery; murder; killer; Vincent Price; Agnes Moorehead;"]','[{"url":"/The_Bat.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/The_Bat.mpeg_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/The_Bat_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','The_Bat.mpeg',36979,'Q3224357','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Hal, a friend of the Dixon family, does not go inside, feeling it would be too difficult to take. Hal finds it hard to believe that, only a few days ago, the Dixons were a relatively regular family. In flashback, he recounts what led to Frank Jr.''s death. Frank Jr. has returned home for the summer to aid his father, Frank Sr. (Harold Agee), on the family farm. He also visits his girlfriend Betty Hutchins (Christine Lynch). When Frank Sr.''s new tractor arrives at the local train station, Frank Jr.''s brother Alan (Tim Bosworth) wishes to drive it, having recently taken a driver''s test. His father disallows it, so Frank Jr. drives it home.
The next day, Alan discovers that his license has arrived in the mail. Ecstatic, he wishes to drive immediately, asking his family members if they need help with any errands. Later, Hal shows up at the Dixon home. Knowing that Alan''s license had been scheduled to arrive, he begins to talk to Alan, telling him about things he should know in order to be able to drive safely, the primary emphasis being on railroad crossings: heeding signal lights, listening for train horns and being wary around double-track crossings. As Jackson finishes giving the advice, Frank Jr. and Betty return home. Alan asks his father if he can drive the car into town. His father lets him, and Frank Jr. and Betty agree to go with him to make sure he arrives safely.
Alan begins driving the car down the road, and sees Frank Jr. and Betty in front of him. They look behind to wave to Alan, and he waves back. However, the pair keep driving while looking backwards. Observing that a railroad with an oncoming train is near, Alan desperately tries to signal to them to stop waving and look ahead. When they do not pay attention to him and continue waving, Alan shields his eyes as the two drive right into the path of the train and are killed. Back in the present, at the funeral, Hal enters his police car, and decides to go back on the road in order to prevent more traffic accidents from occurring.
While the primary focus is on driver safety near railroad crossings, other basic driving safety rules are reinforced, such as not passing on hills or curves, not driving or pulling over when fatigued or sleepy and not being a distracted driver. Alan is also shown a police report of an accident where an acquaintance of his had died in an accident due to his reckless driving. Filling out the film is a nostalgic look back at the early 1900s, when such things as horseless carriages were parts of everyday life and four-lane superhighways—in the late 1950s still a relatively new concept—weren''t even thought of, and slower and less congested roadways meant fewer dangers in driving; however, Hal cautions that his point is that the human body hasn''t changed and that even more attention to safety must be heeded.','["Robert Carlisle"]',NULL,'["William Boyett","Harold Agee","Mrs. Harold Agee"]','[""]','2.8','[]',NULL,'[{"url":"/0845_Last_Clear_Chance_The_08_29_26_00_3mb.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/Last_Clear_Chance_The_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','Last_Clear_Chance_The',6416,'Q16159156','wp','["Leland Baxter"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

('tt0023956','free','Don Quixote (1933)','1933','1h 13min','The film condenses the novel significantly and scrambles up the order of Don Quixote''s adventures. There are several changes. Don Quixote is "dubbed" a knight not by an innkeeper, but by a traveling actor who is appearing as a king in a play that Don Quixote mistakenly believes to be real. As in the later 1957 Russian film version of the novel, the attack on the windmills is moved to near the end of the film. The mill workers are seen returning from their labor, and unlike the novel, Don Quixote is caught up by the windmill but not thrown. The windmill is stopped by the mill workers, who then assist Sancho in carrying Quixote down.
The final scene is the most radically changed of all. Totally defeated, and brought home imprisoned in a cage, Don Quixote sees that his niece, the village priest, and Sanson Carrasco (who in this version is the niece''s fiancee, as in Man of La Mancha) have burnt his beloved books of chivalry. The shock literally kills Don Quixote; he collapses and dies in Sancho''s arms, while the townsfolk, who only a few moments prior, were laughing and jeering at him as he sat in the cage, are deeply moved and now kneel in respect for the dead "knight". In a bit of trick photography, the pages of the original 1605 edition of Cervantes''s novel arise from the flames rather than being consumed by them - a sign that Don Quixote has achieved immortality.
Dulcinea, who appears in the film, is depicted as a not-too-bright milkmaid, and cruelly, she is among those who laugh the hardest when Don Quixote is brought back in a cage.
Don Quixote''s name is Don Quixote in this version. He is never referred to as Alonso Quixano.','["Georg Wilhelm Pabst"]','["Miguel de Cervantes y Saavedra","Alexandre Arnoux"]','["Feodor Chaliapin Sr.","George Robey","Oscar Asche"]','[""]','6.5','["tt0040714","tt0033796","tt0050326","tt0031508","tt0204285","tt0039330","tt0104121","tt0181212","tt0048295","tt0020570","tt7350986","tt0015842"]','["1933, Classic, Feodor Chaliapin"]','[{"url":"/DonQuixote.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/DonQuixote_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/DonQuixote_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','DonQuixote',79968,'Q3415590','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The head of the town women''s club, Mrs. Browning, is charmed by the questionable professor. Parker and invites him to her home and to have a lecture when the club is meeting. He is welcome to use the club as his forum for his teachings.

Dr. Christian, on the other hand, begins to warn the women about the dangers with wholesale diets, claiming that all diets should be tailored to fit the individual and advising the women not to listen to the professor.
The professor''s teachings result in the disruption of the town women''s eating routines. They also disrupt the peace and quiet in the Browning family life, causing Mrs. Browning and her husband to argue about the professor''s teachings and intrusions on the town life. The Browning''s daughter, Kitty, has taken an interest in the professor''s assistant, Bill Ferris, and started an extreme diet to seem more pleasing to him. Kitty soon collapses from starvation.

Widower Sir George Fenwick (Paul Cavanagh), after a romantic night at the apartment of Lydia Marlowe (Hillary Brooke), is hypnotized into believing that he is responsible for the crimes. He is certain that he is guilty after he awakes from a stupor and finds a woman''s forefinger in his pocket. His daughter comes to Holmes and Watson without realizing that Moriarty''s henchman is following her. She tells Holmes and Watson that she found her father burying a forefinger under a pile of soil. She has dug up the forefinger and shows it to them.
Fenwick is then found dead, obviously murdered by someone to keep him from talking. Holmes theorizes that Moriarty, who was supposed to have been hanged in Montevideo, is alive and responsible for the crimes. Watson is then called to help a woman who fell over while feeding her pet bird. He leaves, and minutes later, Moriarty appears and explains that he faked the phone call so he could talk to Holmes. When Moriarty leaves, Watson returns. Holmes explains what Moriarty did, notices that a window shade that was shut in the empty house across the street is now open, and tells Watson to investigate.
Inside the empty house Watson, looking through the window, believes that he sees a sniper shoot Holmes in his apartment. Holmes then appears at the house and explains that he put a bust of Julius Caesar there because of the bust''s resemblance to his own face (Holmes realized that as soon as he sat there, Moriarty would have him killed). Inspector Gregson takes the sniper, a hypnotized ex-soldier, away, but the sniper is later killed on Holmes''s doorstep.
Holmes now realizes that Moriarty''s plan involves:

1) killing women and cutting off their forefingers,
2) making rich, single men believe they have committed the crime,
3) using this fake information to blackmail them, and
4) counting on the victims being too terrified to expose the scheme.He befriends Lydia, whom he had seen with Sir George at a restaurant, suspecting that she is in cahoots with Moriarty. She takes him to her house, where he is apparently hypnotized. Moriarty enters and has one of his men cut Holmes with a knife to verify that he is hypnotized. He then tells Holmes to write a suicide note (which he does), walk out of Lydia''s apartment onto the ledge, and jump to his death.
Watson and the police then appear and grab the criminals. Holmes then reveals he was never really hypnotized, but secretly ingested a drug to make him appear as if he had been hypnotized and also insensitive to pain. Moriarty then escapes from the hold of a policeman and jumps from the top of Lydia''s house to another building. However, he hangs onto a pipe which becomes loose from the building, causing him to fall to his death.','["Roy William Neill"]','["Bertram Millhauser","Arthur Conan Doyle"]','["Basil Rathbone","Nigel Bruce","Hillary Brooke"]','["Drama","Mystery"]','6.7','["tt0038494","tt0038008","tt0039017","tt0037168","tt0037794","tt0037303","tt0036349","tt0035317","tt0036348","tt0035318","tt0037248","tt0031022"]','["Mystery; Murder; Crime; Thriller; Sherlock Holmes"]','[{"url":"/TWIG1945_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/The_Woman_in_Green.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/The_Woman_in_Green_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','TWIG1945',16493,'Q1212662','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

As Gene approaches the ranch, he comes across a fight between Garland and the rancheros, who rent part of the land. Garland is in the process of forcing them off the property. Gene stops Garland from shooting the unarmed men. Garland offers Gene the job of ranch foreman and tells him that he plans to marry Estrellita.

This leads to his feeling constant pangs of guilt from his sister-in-law Martha Douglas (Diane Ladd), who has become his assistant.
One night, Holliston runs over a pregnant Doberman Pinscher. The dog is fatally injured, but Holliston manages to save one of her unborn puppies by gestating it in an artificial uterus. Because the device still requires nutrients to be supplied by the mother, he must drastically shorten the gestation period: to this end, he uses an experimental growth hormone made from human placental lactogen, which speeds up the embryo''s growth. The dog grows to adult size in a few days, and Holliston passes it off as the mother to disguise his secret experiments. Thanks to the serum, it learns incredibly fast and soon becomes a well-trained dog. However, Holliston fails to notice that the animal''s aggression is increasing commensurately: while he is out on an errand, it kills an annoying small dog and conceals the carcass.
Eager to use his discovery for the good of mankind, Holliston applies the same technique to an unborn human extracted from a suicide victim. However, the subject''s cells age uncontrollably, so Holliston uses the drug methotrexate to counter the effect. It works, and the embryo grows into a 24-year-old woman he names Victoria (Barbara Carrera).
Holliston educates Victoria, and she soon gathers photographic encyclopedic knowledge of science, literature and culture. He begins introducing her to his friends and coworkers as a University of Colorado graduate, and she wows them with a riveting game of chess against chess champion Riley (Roddy McDowall), infuriating him when she deliberately lets him win the final move at Holliston''s subtle urging. Holliston completes Victoria''s education by engaging in sex with her at her encouragement.
Soon afterwards, Victoria discovers the rapid aging of her cells has resumed and becomes addicted to the methotrexate to stave off her deterioration. Thanks to a chance meeting with the manager of Teletex International computer systems at a party, Victoria is able to access the most advanced computer system in the state which informs her that she can counter the aging with pituitary gland extract from a 5 to 6 month old human fetus. In addition, Martha has grown jealous of Victoria''s success, and finds out the University of Colorado has never heard of her. Before she leaves for Minneapolis, Victoria poisons her with methotrexate in order to keep her origin secret. Shortly after Martha''s departure, Holliston is informed of her fatal heart attack.
Holliston leaves to meet with Martha''s coroner. Meanwhile, Victoria destroys all of Holliston''s research records and tapes concerning his experiments. Victoria murders a prostitute to get her unborn child. However, the records indicated the child was already dead in the womb and unviable for her needs. When the autopsy reveals that Martha''s death may have been a homicide, Holliston hurries home and alerts his son Gordon to meet him there to go after Victoria. He finds Victoria, now middle-aged, having surgically removed his daughter-in-law Helen''s baby. When he attempts to capture her she stabs and kills Gordon, sending the gestating tank containing the baby crashing to the floor.
Now determined to kill Victoria, Holliston gets in a car chase after her. When a now-elderly Victoria crashes her car, Holliston pulls her out to finish her off, but paramedics intervene and discover the geriatric victim is in labor. As she is being carried away, she reveals that she is pregnant with his baby, causing Holliston to cry out for her death in despair.

At Sevastopol the officers on board a battleship are looking forward to its return to port when they will be allowed to fraternise with local girls. Kostja, one of the officers, is particularly excited. He is in love with Marija, the daughter of Sevastopol''s Governor.
The deck of the ship is being prepared to become a dance-floor for a party. However, revolutionaries led by the Governor of Sevastopol''s disloyal valet, Boris, plan to take over the vessel. They have infiltrated the ship''s crew and are waiting for the upcoming party. When the unsuspecting guests arrive for the dance, the rebel crew surround and murder many of them with the now-unarmed officers. The mutineers also kill the loyal crew members. Kostja falls overboard after a struggle with a mutineer. The mutineers then turn the ship''s guns on the town. The authorities are forced to surrender to the revolutionaries, who then indulge in an orgy of rape, murder and looting.
Marija and her parents have escaped from the battleship with the help of Kostja''s loyal batman, Iwan. Her mother dies from wounds, but Marija and her father hide in a dockside tavern-cum-brothel run by Iwan''s girlfriend Sinaida. The former Governor is a confused and broken man, unable to accept what has happened. Meanwhile, Boris is looking for Marija, for whom he has long had a hitherto hopeless desire. Now he wants her for himself. He tracks her down at the tavern. He reveals to her that he is the leader of the revolutionaries, and tells her of his desire for her, but says he only wants her if she agrees of her own free will.
After he leaves Marija gets a message from Kostja, who has survived. He is organising a counter-revolution. Boris lures Kostja into a trap and captures the leading counter-revolutionaries. However, Kostja later escapes. He and a group of supporters retake the battleship and launch a raid on the fortress in which the revolutionaries are holding the prisoners. Believing Kostja is still in captivity, Marija visits Boris to plead with him for Kostja''s life. Drunk, Boris attempts to rape her, but Marija''s father suddenly enters, kills Boris, and then collapses dead. In a battle between the revolutionaries and their opponents, the prisoners are freed and taken to the battleship. Before leaving port, they blow up the fortress, killing most of the revolutionaries. Marija and Kostja look back on the town, realising they must leave their country, but have the world before them.','["Karl Anton"]','["Charlie Roellinghoff","Karl Anton"]','["Theodor Loos","Gabriele Hoffmann","Camilla Horn"]','[""]','6.8','[]','["Sebastopol"]','[{"url":"/1937-Panzerkreuzer-Sebastopol_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/1937-PanzerkreuzerSebastopol-WeisseSklaven107m09s416x320_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','1937-Panzerkreuzer-Sebastopol',20853,'Q1674134','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

During the raid, Bill takes money from a wealthy passenger and gives it to a poor woman passenger, then rides away. Having lived an outlaw life for the past twenty years, and still wanted for a murder he did not commit, Pecos Bill, whose real name is Ben Wade, decides to return to his home town disguised as a regular cowboy to see his now grown daughter.
Meanwhile, Jack Bellounds (Weldon Heyburn), the son of the corrupt rancher William Bellounds (Stanley Andrews) who stole Ben''s White Slider ranch, returns from prison and is given a ride back to the ranch by Ben''s beautiful daughter Collie Wade (Charlotte Field), who was raised by his father. When Collie refuses his offer of marriage, the arrogant Jack races their horse-drawn carriage wildly through the desert. Seeing the runaway carriage, the gallant ranch forman Wils Moore (Russell Hayden) chases them down and stops the horses. As Wils rides off, Jack notices that Collie is attracted to Wils.
When Ben and Frosty arrive at White Slider ranch, they get hired on as saddle makers, with Ben going by the name of Red Johnson. No one recognizes him—not even his daughter who hasn''t seen him since her childhood. After settling in, Ben learns that 200 head of cattle have been stolen, and that Bellounds seems uninterested in finding the thieves. With the help of Frosty and Wils—one of the few honest men at the ranch—Ben intends to put a stop to the cattle rustling and restore the ranch to his daughter, the rightful owner.
Meanwhile, Jack meets with Cap Folsom (Monte Blue), the leader of the cattle rustlers and Jack''s former boss. Cap is also the man who murdered Ben''s partner and framed him for the crime. Jack complains about the timing of the recent raid, but Folsom dismisses him, saying he can never turn his back on his outlaw past. At the ranch, Ben is tasked with working with the dogs on the ranch, and soon he uses his position to guard the cattle. One afternoon, Ben meets his daughter on the range and they talk about her future. Concerned that she may end up with a lout like Jack, he tells her that she will need to decide between Jack and Wils. Soon after, Ben is alerted by his barking dogs to rustlers in the area, and dressed in black as Pecos Bill, he rides after them. The rustlers recognize the approaching outlaw and take cover. During the ensuing gunfight, Wils arrives with his trustworthy men, sees Pecos Bill, and chases after him instead of the rustlers.
Back at the ranch, Wils attempts to capture Ben, but is thwarted by a well-placed knife throw by Frosty. Knowing that Wils is on the right side of the law, Ben reveals his true identity and the truth behind how he lost his ranch—that he left his foreman William Bellounds to look after things, but he stole the ranch for himself, and now is rustling his own cattle for profit. Convinced he is on the level, Wils pledges to help Ben. When the other ranchers get together to search for the rustlers, Ben dresses up in black like Pecos Bill, draws their attention, and leads them to the rustlers'' hideout. The plan backfires when the ranchers discover that Wils helped Pecos Bill to escape. Just as the mob prepares to lynch Wils, Pecos Bill rides in to the rescue.
When Bellounds figures out that Pecos Bill is in fact Ben Wade, his former boss, he reveals his discovery to the leader of the rustlers, Cap Folsom. Soon, Bellounds is gunned down in cold blood. Jack goes after Cap to avenge his father''s death, and is himself soon killed. Ben, Wils, and Frosty go after Cap and they meet in a fierce gunfight. During the battle, Ben tracks down Cap in the rustlers hideout, gives him a chance to draw, and then shoots him dead. Sometime later, Ben and Frosty say their goodbyes to Collie and Wils and ride away into the Arizona desert.','["Lesley Selander"]',NULL,'["Douglass Dumbrille","Sidney Toler","Russell Hayden"]','["Action","Crime","Drama","Romance","Western"]','6.4','["tt0031419","tt0033351","tt0040946","tt0027789","tt0024366","tt0032706","tt0034586","tt0040851","tt0033683","tt0022999","tt0032326"]','[""]','[{"url":"/mark_of_the_avenger.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/mark_of_the_avenger_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/mark_of_the_avenger_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','mark_of_the_avenger',13781,'Q7752859','wp','["Maurice Geraghty"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The Nirvano Gas works, but the dirigible is buried in an avalanche and is not found until 500 years have passed. When Buck and Buddy are found, they awaken in the year 2440 to a world ruled by the ruthless dictator, Killer Kane (Anthony Warde), and his army of "super-racketeers".

He then weds a German princess, Anne of Cleves (played by Laughton''s real-life wife Elsa Lanchester). This marriage ends in divorce when Anne deliberately makes herself unattractive so she can be free to marry her sweetheart. (In an imaginative and high-spirited scene, Anne "wins her freedom" from Henry in a game of cards on their wedding night.) After this divorce, Henry marries the beautiful and ambitious Lady Katherine Howard (Binnie Barnes). She has rejected love all her life in favour of ambition, but after her marriage, she finally falls in love with Henry''s handsome courtier Thomas Culpeper (Robert Donat) who has attempted to woo her in the past. Their liaison is discovered by Henry''s court and the two are executed. The weak and aging Henry consoles himself with a final marriage to Catherine Parr (Everley Gregg) who proves domineering.

The car stops at a police station, and the officers inside it transport their drunk prisoner to the station. Inside the station, Marilyn Gregor (Dolores Fuller) meets  Inspector Johns (Lyle Talbot) and Lt. Bob Lawrence (Steve Reeves). Through their discussion, the viewers learn that her brother Don Gregor (Clancy Malone) had been arrested for carrying an unlicensed handgun. She has just posted bail for him, and the two officers warn her that she would forfeit if her brother fails to show up for his trial. They release her brother, but they refuse Don''s request to return his handgun. As the Gregor siblings leave, John muses about the son of a great doctor being a jerk. Lawrence suggests it could be a result of the "sins of the father". Johns suspects the young man was an associate of gangster Vic Brady (Timothy Farrell).The Gregor siblings return home and Don immediately heads for the liquor cabinet in the living room, pouring himself a drink. He then reminds Marilyn that he is a legal adult, and claims to know what he in doing. Both statements aim to prevent Marilyn from lecturing him on his behavior. They briefly argue and she breaks his glass. Afterwards, Don opens a book safe and retrieves a hidden revolver. As he prepares to leave, Don has a chance encounter with his father Dr. Boris Gregor (Herbert Rawlinson) at the front door. The son exits into the night, while the father enters the home. As his daughter pours a drink for him, the Doctor reveals that he is already aware of Don''s association with Vic Brady and his recent arrest. Inspector Johns had notified him with a phone call. But he is not particularly worried, feeling that everything will work out in the end. He blames Don''s current behavior on the premature death of Mrs. Gregor and his own upbringing having had the unintentional effect of spoiling the boy.While Marilyn expresses concern over the influence of Brady on Don, her father continues to drink. He then heads for the book safe and discovers that the revolver is missing. He seems aware of his son''s secrets, despite his apparent denial concerning his criminal tendencies. The scene shifts to the Hunters'' Inn, a bar in Temple City, California, where Don and Brady meet. Don receives his share of the money for his role in a recent robbery. They are then joined by Johns and Lawrence, and briefly "cops" and "crooks" (as they call each other) drink together. The policemen provoke Don into a confrontation, and he knocks over Johns'' drink. As the officers intended, this gives them the excuse to frisk him. They fail to find the revolver, as he had earlier offered it to Brady for safekeeping. John orders both criminals to leave the bar and they obey.Outside the bar, Brady chastises Don for his impulsive behavior with the officers. Don wants revenge against Johns, but Brady dismisses the idea and reminds his partner that they have other plans. They are going to rob the payroll of the Monterey Theatre, though Don has his doubts about the plan. At the Gregor House, Marilyn has changed into her nightgown while her father sleeps in an armchair, probably drunk. She wakes him up to discuss their concern over Don''s nocturnal activities. The father states that he can''t see his own son as a wrongdoer. But he also expresses guilt over his own failure as a father. Brady and Don break into a closed theatre and ambush the nightwatchman (Bud Osborne).The nightwatchman is forced at gunpoint to open the safe for the criminals. At this point Miss Willis (Mona McKinnon), a bookkeeper, end her shift and attempts to leave the building. She startles the criminals, and the robbery starts having casualties. Don shoots and kills the nightwatchman, while Brady shoots the fleeing woman in the back. Afterwards Brady collects their loot while Don seems to be in shock over his own actions. The two criminals flee while police sirens are heard approaching the theatre. A car chase scene follows, with the driving Brady managing to lead their car to safety. At the theatre, a doctor examines the wounded Willis, while Johns receives the basic information on the case: robbery, murder, and attempted murder. The nightwatchman is identified as a recently retired veteran of the police force, who took his last the job just to relieve his boredom. The officers decide to treat this case as one involving cop killers. The press has already arrived at the murder scene, in the person of a female reporter (Regina Claire) and her photographer.Brady leads Don to the residence of his gun moll, Loretta (Tedi Thurman). While he explains their situation to her, Don leaves unnoticed. When Loretta notices his absence, Brady decides to search for him. The following night, Don wanders the streets until deciding to visit his father''s office. He confesses the murder to his father, and the doctor urges him to surrender to the police. The guilt-ridden Don agrees to do so eventually, but wishes for more time to think things through. His father helps him escape the arriving police. While fleeing Don is captured by Brady, who drives him back to Loretta''s residence. The three of them listen to the radio, where the case of Paul McKenna (the nightwatchman)''s murder is covered and both their names are announced as murder suspects. Also mentioned in the broadcast is that Don is the son of a famous plastic surgeon. Don repeatedly expresses his decision to surrender and face the consequences of his actions. Fearing for his own safety, Brady kills his partner. The corpse is temporarily stored behind a curtain.An argument between Brady and Loretta follows. She accuses him of destroying everything and everybody that comes in contact with him, while Brady reminds her that he once rescued her from the gutter. He insists that she should stay by his side to the end. The two end the argument in an embrace. At this point, Brady conceives a plan to elude the police by undergoing plastic surgery. He contacts Dr. Gregor, claiming that he is holding Don hostage until plastic surgery is completed. The doctor decides to have Marilyn assist him, since she is a trained nurse.Days later, Lawrence attempt to romance Marilyn, with the ulterior motive of seeking further information on Don. She coldly turns him down. Later than night, Brady, the doctor, Loretta, and Marilyn gather in preparation of the operation. Brady expresses his distrust of the Gregors and has to be convinced that anesthesia is necessary. With Brady sedated, Dr. Gregor searches Loretta''s residence for a water basin. He finds it, but also finds Don''s stored corpse. He keeps this a secret and maintains a facade of calmness while performing and completing the operation. He claims that the bandages covering Brady''s face have to stay on for two weeks. The necessity of a second visit saves his life and that of his daughter, as Loretta had orders to kill them both once the operation was over.Two weeks later, Brady and Loretta arrive to the Gregor residence on schedule. But so do Johns and Lawrence, who were both summoned by the doctor. They want to know who the bandaged man is. When Brady''s bandages are removed, his new face is revealed to be modeled after that of Don. Besides the Doctor, everyone else considers him to be the wanted murderer. And the Doctor claims that the man is his son. A horrified Brady attempts to flee and is killed in a shootout with the police. His dying body falls into a swimming pool.','["Edward D.

When the train is bombed from the air at night, some of the prisoners escape. Englishman Lieutenant Halliday and American Sergeant Braddock stumble across each other in the dark and team up. 
The next day, they are given a ride in a cart carrying sacks of wheat. The driver manages to talk Italian soldiers out of inspecting his cargo, before letting his passengers off in the countryside. When they reach a river, they split up to search for a boat. The Englishman encounters a pretty young woman washing clothes. The two men get a boat and start rowing, but then the woman runs up and tells them that an armistice has been signed, so they turn around. They head to town, but it is strangely quiet, and nobody is in the streets celebrating. Then the Germans arrive and take over. The woman''s uncle gives the two men civilian clothes and recommends they try to sneak aboard a freight train, which they do. At one stop, they watch helplessly as a woman is separated from her husband, who is taken away with others by train by the Germans.
Afterward, they head into the mountains. They encounter a band of partisans, who let them cross a bridge. One of the Italians warns them not to endanger the people in the town. The pair go to the church, where the priest agrees to help them. Refugees return from trying to cross the mountains, driven back by a snow storm. The priest takes Halliday to the inn and introduces him to Giuseppe, the guide. He promises to try to get the entire party, along with the new additions, across tomorrow. He points out a Polish tailor and his niece, a factory worker from Belgrade, a professor more concerned about his papers than his own life, and Frenchwoman Madame Monnier. As Halliday is leaving, Frau Wittels (the woman who lost her husband earlier) and her son Bernard arrive to join the group. Already hiding in the church is British Major Telford. He persuades Halliday and Braddock to stick around and perhaps join the partisans.
A radio broadcast announces that Il Duce, the deposed Italian fascist leader, has been freed by the Germans. A disgruntled former fascist heads to the valley to betray the refugees. That night, shooting is heard coming from the bridge. The people seek the priest for advice. He tells them to hide in the woods, but leave the children and old people in his charge. The priest persuades the three soldiers to lead the refugees to Giuseppe. After they are gone, the fascist informant reluctantly tells the priest that he has to take him to the Germans.
When the refugees reach Giuseppe''s village, they find the Germans have gotten there first. Giuseppe''s mother tells them her son is dead, along with the rest of the men of the village. Another villager asks the soldiers to take some orphans with them too. Reluctantly, the major agrees. The group head up into the mountains during a snowstorm. The aged tailor cannot keep up; he lays down in the snow and prays. The others find shelter in a mountain rescue hut.
When the storm ends, a German patrol appears. The soldiers have orders to close the frontier, so they bypass the hut, but now the pass is guarded. Halliday proposes he create a diversion, using the major''s pistol (and five bullets), but Telford turns him down. Instead, the entire party set out at night, hoping to escape detection. They have to hide when they spot a ski patrol. Bernard breaks into the open and draws the Germans away, though he is shot dead. The others make it into Switzerland, though Halliday is himself shot. A Swiss officer informs them that only children, people over 65 and political refugees can remain. He manages to get authority from the government to let everyone stay.

After having stopped by the Mennonite farm, where Tommy and Martha stay with the William and Annie Decker (Robert Barrat and Dorothy Peterson), the Johnsons are headed back to their hometown of Goshen. That night over dinner, Tommy, Martha and the Decker''s discuss the possibility of Tommy and Martha returning to their home in Kansas to work their farm, having fully recovered from the death of Mr. Marti. William Decker does not wish to allow them to return without the help of a man on the farm. Tommy suggests that Henry Johnson would be happy to assist. Mrs. Decker agrees that Henry had displayed affections for Martha while he was at the farm. It is decided that in order to get both Tommy and Martha home, $92 would be needed in order to pay the train fare home. To Martha''s dismay, William writes Henry for the $92 if he wishes to marry Martha and send her home. Henry is to respond with a letter detailing his answer. William gives the letter to Tommy, who is to mail it when he is through with his chores. Instead, Tommy tears the letter up and does not send it.Enter Samuel Terwilliger (Charlie Ruggles), a street-smart, money-making man. Tommy tells Mr. Terwilliger that he has saved old newspapers for him to buy. As Tommy runs in the house to get the papers, a man comes by to drop off money for William Decker for a tobacco sale. Tommy takes the money and sets it on William''s desk. Next to the desk is the trunk where Tommy kept the newspapers. While Tommy was rummaging through the trunk, one of the twenty dollar bills on the desk landed in a newspaper, to be taken to Mr. Terwilliger. As Tommy and Mr. Terwilliger get to talking Tommy learns about Philadelphia, Mr. Terwilliger''s home town. That evening, Tommy decides to go to Philadelphia with Mr. Terwilliger, so he sneaks out of the house and hops in Mr. Terwilliger''s wagon.
Mr. Terwilliger and Tommy travel along the next day, and after a close-call with a train, make it to Philadelphia. Soon Tommy gets a job at the adjacent ice rink, scraping the ice after the performers practice. Back at home, William has discovered the missing twenty dollars, and blames Tommy for taking it. Every week, Tommy sends a letter home with a dollar, but William remains angry. One day as Tommy is scraping the ice, he sings along to a song the band is playing. The manager of the rink offers to hire him on as a singer for the shows. Mr. Terwilliger acts as Tommy''s manager, and negotiates a wage. Later Tommy finds out that Mr.Terwilliger had been secretly keeping Tommy''s money. Tommy uses the stashed money to return home.
Upon his return home, he is greeted with joy from everyone except for William, who insists on the return of his twenty dollars. Tommy traces the money back in his mind, and realizes that it fell into one of the newspapers Mr. Terwilliger used to stuff an antique chair. The two of them then run around the country in order to seek the chair, and find the twenty dollars. Finally, they locate the chair, and bring the twenty dollars back home. With all debts cleared, Tommy and Martha can finally go home to Goshen where they run the farm with Henry and Reuben Johnson.','["Edward F. Cline"]','["Mary C.

After his death Pollyanna is sent to live on a New England plantation with her rich Aunt Polly (Katherine Griffith).
Aunt Polly is extremely harsh with Pollyanna by not allowing her to speak of her father in her house and choosing the attic for her bedroom.  She even takes Pollyanna shopping for new clothes. One day while playing on the plantation, Pollyanna gets in trouble with a servant woman and runs to hide in a haystack.  There she meets Jimmy Bean (Howard Ralston), an orphan her age. Taking pity on him, Pollyanna is certain eventually Aunt Polly will let him live with them. So she hides him in the cellar.  One day Aunt Polly insists in going in the cellar despite Pollyanna''s pleas for fear Jimmy will be discovered.  Jimmy is asleep and Pollyanna believes they''re in the clear; until Jimmy starts shouting in his sleep, having a bad dream about turnips chasing and trying to eat him. Pollyanna is amused but Aunt Polly is not.  After some pleading, Aunt Polly relents and tells Pollyanna to bring some good quilts for Jimmy.
One day, as Jimmy and Pollyanna play with the other children, they decide to try and steal some apples from a tree belonging to John Pendleton (William Cortleigh). John catches Pollyanna in the act, but forgives her, realizing she is the exact image of her mother, a woman he once loved deeply, but she loved Pollyanna''s father instead.  He tells Pollyanna this as he shows her a painting of her mother.  Meanwhile, Jimmy fights his way in, fearing that Pollyanna is in danger. He tries to defend her but finds that everything is normal.
As Pollyanna settles in she seems to bring optimism to those she meets. She is insistent on playing a game her father taught her called ''The Glad Game'', where one counts the things they are glad for. She visits an old shut-in who is supposedly grateful for nothing. Pollyanna brings along an old blind and deaf friend who plays the accordion. Upon discovering the woman is blind and deaf, the shut-in proclaims her gratitude for still having her sight and hearing.
One day after a fight with Jimmy in which he ''wishes she would die'', Pollyanna heads into town. She notices a little girl playing in the middle of the road, oblivious to a car coming. Pollyanna leaps in front of the car, throwing the girl to safety, but in the process is hit herself. Jimmy and John both take her back to her Aunt''s place. Aunt Polly becomes frantic and places her in her own lavish bedroom. Realizing the error of her ways, Aunt Polly declares how attached to Pollyanna she is; even giving her a kiss on the forehead, much to Pollyanna''s delight.
Realizing they could have lost the little girl forever, many succumb to her wishes for them to be happy. John promises to adopt Jimmy the next day. Aunt Polly refuses to call Dr. Tom, (Herbert Prior), who broke her heart years before.  Pollyanna pleads to send for him but she refuses, bringing in another doctor. After several days, they discover Pollyanna is paralyzed from the waist down.  Pollyanna becomes distraught; however Jimmy comforts her, insisting she play the Glad Game.
Months pass and Pollyanna begins to use a wheelchair.  One evening with Aunt Polly, she pleads one last time for her to send for Dr. Tom and Aunt Polly finally relents. With the help of Dr. Tom, Pollyanna is eventually able to walk again.
With the success of her walking comes the realization of her wishes. Aunt Polly reunites romantically with Dr. Tom and John adopts Jimmy.  One day, she asks for Jimmy and he comes to wheel her around the garden. He gives Pollyanna a ring and promptly runs off out of fear, not realizing Pollyanna is able to walk.  She is excited at the ring and happily runs after him.','["Paul Powell"]','["Eleanor H.

('tt0069994','free','The Forgotten (1973)','1973','1h 29min','The film is set in Stephens Sanitarium, a secluded rural mental health institute whose chief doctor believes that the best way to deal with insanity is to allow the patients to freely act out their realities in the hopes that they will snap out of it, so to speak. The film begins with an elderly nurse in Stephens Sanitorium making her rounds.  After a troubling incident in which a patient threatens her life, she decides to retire and goes out to visit the chief doctor, Dr. Stephens, to inform him of the decision. Unfortunately, in the process of therapy (which involves chopping wood with an axe), the crazed former magistrate known as Judge (Gene Ross) accidentally lands the axe in Dr. Stephens'' back, apparently killing him. The shaken nurse returns inside to finish packing, where she is attacked by Harriet (Camilla Carr), a patient who accuses her of stealing her "baby" (actually a plastic doll). The patient kills her by crushing her head in the nurse''s suitcase.
The only remaining doctor appears to be Dr. Geraldine Masters (Anne MacAdams), who is greeted by Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik), a pretty young nurse who informs Dr. Masters that Dr. Stephens had hired her a week ago. Dr. Masters begrudgingly allows her to settle in. The young nurse meets the patients, including a lobotomized and childish man named Sam (Bill McGhee) who enjoys popsicles and his plastic toy boat, a nymphomaniac and schizophrenic named Allyson (Betty Chandler), an emotionally dependent woman named Jennifer (Harryette Warren), an octogenarian woman named Mrs. Callingham (Rhea MacAdams) who spouts bizarre poetry and mistakes flowers in the garden to be her own children, a juvenile prankster named Danny (Jessie Kirby), a shellshocked Sergeant (Hugh Feagin) who lost his mind after accidentally killing his men in Vietnam, and the crazed judge who seems incapable of speaking in anything other than courtroom jargon and the repeated phrase "My name... is... Oliver... W... Cameron..."
Dr. Masters becomes disturbed when a telephone man comes to investigate the faulty phone system at the institution. Mrs. Callingham''s tongue is ripped out of her mouth during her sleep, although Dr. Masters tells Charlotte that Mrs. Callingham did it to herself. The audience later discovers that Dr. Masters is actually a patient at the institute and that Dr. Stephens had allowed her to pretend to be a doctor. Dr. Masters burns the Sergeant''s hand after he disobeys her, and murders Jennifer for stealing medicine. After a frantic conversation with Allyson, Charlotte discovers Dr. Masters'' secret. Mrs. Callingham indicates to Charlotte that it was Masters who cut out her tongue, apparently to prevent the elderly woman from disclosing the secret. Charlotte then discovers the body of the telephone man in the kitchen closet, presumably murdered by Masters to make sure he would not report the institution''s situation to anyone on the outside. Allyson is distraught, as she thought the man was going to marry her, but she convinces herself that the man is still alive and drags his body to her room so she can have sex with it.
Charlotte realizes that her life is in grave danger, and she tries to escape. The judge informs her that they all know Masters is a patient, but that they think Charlotte is a patient also. Charlotte finds that all the windows and doors have been boarded up by Masters, preventing an escape. Sam then leads Charlotte to the basement, where she is startled by a man grabbing her ankle, and beats him to death with a toy boat. She realizes that it is Dr. Stephens, but not before finishing him off.  Sam, at the direction of Masters, leads Charlotte upstairs, apparently, so the judge can axe her to death.  Sam thinks Charlotte murdered Dr. Stephens on purpose, so he helps restrain her. However, he has a flashback from his lobotomy (which Masters had assisted with) and lets Charlotte go. He then leaves the room as Masters cowers in a corner. As Sam leaves, the other inmates enter with weapons, and the judge brutally axes Masters to death. Sam is deeply disturbed, and grabs the axe and proceeds to kill all the other inmates except Ms. Callingham, who is not in the room. Charlotte is already outside, having been told of a secret exit in the basement by Sam. She wanders around outside as the camera goes back to Sam, who, while eating a popsicle and viewing the carnage, cries to himself.','["S.F.

This Academy Award-nominated film features compelling first person accounts, which reveal the physical, legal, and emotional consequences during the era when abortion was a criminal act.  Until recently, the era of illegal abortion had been a "sealed chapter" in U.S. women''s history.

The aura of shame surrounding unwanted pregnancies and abortion before Roe v. Wade kept most women from ever admitting that they had had illegal abortions - an experience which many had faced, but about which few ever spoke.

Women suffering complications from back alley or self-induced abortions avoided admitting what they had done. As a result, many women died from untreated infections while some hemorrhaged to death. Candid interviews reveal the tragedies, as well as the courage and heroism of a shrouded time. This poignant oral history weaves together the untold stories of these women with the work of individuals who risked arrest in order to help them.

When Ford leaves on vacation intending to miss the celebration, his publicity manager Lee Wilson (William Newell) convinces singing cowboy Gene Autry (Gene Autry) to appear in Tom''s place. While driving to Dallas from Hollywood, Gene meets Marion Hill (Kay Hughes) when his trailer collides with her wagon. Marion is also on her way to the centennial, intending to enter her show steer in the Texas Centennial Exposition. Watching Gene skillfully retrieve her cattle, Marion is impressed to see a movie star perform like a true cowboy. 
At the Texas Centennial in Dallas, Gene (pretending to be movie star Tom Ford) sings on the radio and becomes a national hit. Studio head Swartz (Charles Judels), hoping to capitalize on the publicity, decides to launch a series of Western musicals starring Tom Ford, even though the real Ford cannot sing a note. When the engagement of Gene (as Tom Ford) and Marion is announced in the newspapers, Ford''s real fiancée is infuriated. Meanwhile, gambler Tony Rico (Harry Worth) and his henchmen arrive in Dallas to collect the $10,000 that Tom owes. Wilson is forced to pay the debt, plus $25,000 to keep Rico from revealing Gene''s identity. Tom Ford finally shows up and reports to Swartz, but the studio head would rather appease the blackmailers than replace Gene with the talentless Ford. 
At the "Cavalcade of Texas" Gene and Marion perform as part of the centennial. When Tom Ford''s fiancée shows up, Marion is forced to leave. In order to save his romance with Marion, Gene takes a risk and confesses his true identity over the radio. To his surprise, the audience prefers him to the real Tom Ford. Gene''s confession ruins Rico''s blackmail attempt, and he and his henchmen escape with the blackmail money by dressing as cowboys and joining the cavalcade act. Gene chases after the outlaws in true western style, eventually arresting them. During the chase, the money is lost in a lagoon by Gene''s sidekick, Frog (Smiley Burnette).

Also summoned by Louis Jarvis Sr is Honey Carter, the daughter of the only woman he ever loved.  Jarvis Senior''s dying wish is that Honey and Louis get together with the elder Jarvis planning his will so that Junior will not inherit his estate until he marries Honey, or a woman like him to bring him happiness and stability. Sadly the elder Jarvis dies before meeting his son and Honey.
Jarvis Senior''s shady lawyer Henry Talbot sees a chance to get a portion of the Jarvis estate for himself by rewriting the will to make it sound like Jarvis Junior must marry a woman with the attributes of his secretary Rusty with the plan that Rusty will divorce Jarvis Junior and she and Henry will split the estate.  The ruse is undetected with Junior Jarvis having a time limit where if he is not married the estate will go to Henry to distribute to charities.
Junior urgently needs the money to produce his new stage musical.  Junior is not keen to marry Rusty, but his friend suggests they cast the show with a lead having the physical attributes of Rusty, however Henry attempts to stop the show by scaring off Junior''s investors.','["William Forest Crouch"]','["William Forest Crouch","Irwin Winehouse"]','["Louis Jordan","June Richmond","Milton Woods"]','[""]','5.8','["tt0040508","tt0030089","tt0039460","tt0031784","tt0040176","tt0036870","tt0077740","tt0127666","tt0039521","tt0033029"]','["Musical; Louis Jordan"]','[{"url":"/Reet_Petite_and_Gone.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Reet_Petite_and_Gone_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/Reet_Petite_and_Gone_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','Reet_Petite_and_Gone',13689,'Q7307021','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

His guest, Harding (Maurice Braddell), shares his worries, while another friend, the over-optimistic Pippa Passworthy (Edward Chapman), believes it will not come to pass, and if it does, it will accelerate technological progress. An aerial bombing raid on the city that night results in general mobilisation and then global war.
Months later, Cabal, now a Royal Air Force airman piloting a Hawker Fury, shoots down an enemy aircraft dropping gas on the British countryside. He lands and pulls the badly injured enemy pilot (John Clements) from the wreckage. As they dwell on the madness of war, they put on their gas masks, as poison gas drifts in their direction. When a young girl runs towards them the wounded pilot insists she take his mask, choosing to accept death to save her life. Cabal takes the girl to his aeroplane, pausing to leave the doomed man a revolver. The pilot dwells on the irony that he may have gassed the child''s family and yet he has sacrificed his own life in order to save her. A gun shot is then heard.
The war continues into the 1960s, long enough for the people of the world to have forgotten why they are fighting. Humanity enters a new Dark Age. Every city in the world is in ruins, the economy has been decimated by hyperinflation, and there is little technology left apart from weapons of war. By 1966 the enemy''s armies and navies have been defeated, but their greatly depleted air force are deploying a biological weapon called the "wandering sickness" in a final desperate bid for victory. Dr. Harding and his daughter struggle to find a cure, but with little equipment it is hopeless. The plague kills half of humanity and extinguishes the last vestiges of government.
By 1970, the warlord Rudolf (Ralph Richardson), known as the "Boss", has become the chieftain of Everytown and eradicated the pestilence by shooting the infected. He has started yet another war, this time against the "hill people" of the Floss Valley to obtain coal and shale to render into oil so his ragtag collection of prewar planes can fly again.
On May Day 1970, a sleek new aeroplane lands in Everytown, startling the inhabitants who have not seen a new machine in many years. The pilot, John Cabal, emerges and proclaims that the last surviving band of engineers and mechanics known as "World Communications" have formed a civilisation of airmen called "Wings Over the World", based in Basra, Iraq. They have outlawed war and are rebuilding civilisation throughout the Near East and the Mediterranean. Cabal considers the Boss and his band of warlords to be brigands, but offers them the opportunity to join them in rebuilding the world. The Boss immediately rejects the offer and takes Cabal prisoner, forcing him to work for his mechanic Gordon, who struggles to keep the Boss''s biplanes airworthy. Gordon takes an Avro 504K up for a test flight and heads for Iraq to alert World Communications.
Gigantic flying wing aircraft arrive over Everytown and saturate its population with sleeping gas globes. The Boss orders his air force to attack, but the obsolete fighters inflict little damage. The people awaken shortly thereafter to find themselves under the control of Wings Over the World and the Boss dead from a fatal allergic reaction to the sleeping gas. Cabal observes, "Dead, and his old world dead with him ... and with a new world beginning ... And now for the rule of the Airmen and a new life for mankind".
A montage follows, showing decades of technological progress, beginning with Cabal explaining plans for global consolidation by Wings Over the World. By 2036, mankind lives in modern underground cities, including the new Everytown. Civilisation is at last devoted to peace and scientific progress.
All is not well, however. The sculptor Theotocopulos (Cedric Hardwicke) incites the populace to demand a "rest" from all the rush of progress, symbolised by the coming first manned flight around the Moon. The modern-day Luddites are opposed by Oswald Cabal, the head of the governing council and grandson of John Cabal. Oswald Cabal''s daughter Catherine (Pearl Argyle) and Maurice Passworthy (Kenneth Villiers) insist on manning the capsule. When a mob later forms and rushes to destroy the space gun, used to propel the projectile toward the Moon, Cabal launches it ahead of schedule.
Later, after the projectile is just a tiny light in the immense night sky, Oswald Cabal delivers a stirring philosophical monologue about what is to come for mankind to his troubled and questioning friend, Raymond Passworthy (Chapman), the father of Maurice. He speaks passionately to progress and humanity''s unending quest for knowledge and advancement as it journeys out into immensity of space to conquer the stars and beyond. He concludes with the rhetorical questions, "All the universe or nothingness? Which shall it be, Passworthy? Which shall it be? ..."','["William Cameron Menzies"]',NULL,'["Raymond Massey","Edward Chapman","Ralph Richardson"]','["Drama","Sci-Fi","War"]','6.7','["tt3916196","tt0206442","tt4120176","tt0028201","tt0024188","tt0024894","tt0027532","tt0028683","tt0026174","tt0028010","tt0028333","tt0048158"]','["Sci-Fi"]','[{"url":"/things_to_come_ipod_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/thingstocome.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/thingstocome_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','things_to_come_ipod',123189,'Q241141','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

But the crew, having survived their ordeal, don their scuba gear and leave the bell.  Instead of reaching the surface, they surface in a cavern.  The crew members explore the cave and find a skeleton, then a disheveled old sailor named Matheny (George Skaff) who tells them that he and another sailor suffered a shipwreck fourteen years prior and has been living in these caves ever since. He claims there is no way out and a volcano provides air from the surface.
Meanwhile, up on the surface Prof. Wyman''s younger brother builds another bell and launches it in an attempted rescue mission.

Three years later, unhappy in her marriage due to her husband''s continued infidelity, she asks for and receives a divorce. Because of her pride, she does not want his money, but she also does not want to deprive her daughter of a comfortable lifestyle.  She allows Jack and his mother (Charlotte Walker) to retain custody of her daughter Connie (Anita Louise). 
Focusing on her career, she rises through the hierarchy of the hotel where she is employed, shunning the attention of the rich banker Jimmy Damier (John Halliday), preferring the attentions of the reporter Tommy Rock (Robert Ames), although, due to her prior sour relationship, she refuses to marry him.  Eventually, Millie is promoted to the head of operations for the hotel.  At the same time, Tommy is offered a lucrative position at the bank by Damier as a favor to Millie.  However, at the celebration party, Millie discovers that Tommy, just like Maitland, is cheating on her.
Betrayed a second time, Millie becomes very bitter.  With her female cohorts, Helen and Angie (Lilyan Tashman and Joan Blondell, respectively), she becomes a woman who loves a good time, floating from man to man.  This goes on for several years, until she hears that Damier has taken an interest in her teen-age daughter, Connie, who bears a striking resemblance to her.  Millie warns Damier to leave her daughter alone, but, although he promises to stay away from Connie, he ignores Millie''s warning and takes Connie to a remote lodge to seduce her. Millie is tipped off, goes to the lodge with a gun, confronts Jimmy and kills him.
In the ensuing murder trial, Millie tries to keep her daughter''s name out of the press and claims not to remember why she shot Jimmy. She says that another woman ran out of the lodge after the shot, but claims that she did not see who the woman was and has no idea as to her identity.  The prosecution thus claims that Millie''s motive was jealousy of Jimmy''s romantic relationship with this unknown other woman.  Millie''s friends, however, help to bring out the truth, and when the jury finds out that Millie''s true motive was to protect her daughter from Jimmy''s lascivious intentions, they acquit her.

However, when Casper tries to make friends with a baby calf, it runs away, calling for its "mama", when the mother goes up to Casper, she runs away from the farm and jumped over the moon.
Later, Casper comes across a skunk and asks it to be friends, but it sprays him and runs away in terror. Casper sits on a log and ultimately cries because none of the animals want to be his friend. While Casper is sitting on the log, he catches the attention of a small fox cub who feels sorry for him.

However, Casper and Ferdie''s relationship is put in tremendous jeopardy, while they are playing a game of Hide and Seek.

The film then cuts forward in time to a small European village where a series of mysterious murders are taking place. The villagers readily assemble in mob form, with torches, at the house of Professor Kristan (Ralph Morgan) after every murder. The villagers suspect that a giant bat is to blame for the murders. Kristan gives the villagers advice on staying safe, and assures them a scientific explanation exists.
However, in subsequent scenes, Kristan himself is revealed to be the murderer. He is seized by attacks (triggered by darkness) which transform him into a trance-like state of murderousness. After he commits a murder, he awakens from the trance with no memory of the deed, believing himself merely to have fainted.  Kristan''s obliviousness is further enabled by the intervention of his loyal hunchback Zan, the only person aware of Kristan''s condition. Zan follows Kristan when he is in his trances, ensuring the professor is not discovered.
An old friend of Kristan''s, Dr. Bizet, arrives to visit, and soon suspects what is happening. Bizet discloses to Kristan that his mother was bitten by a vampire bat, and that traits of vampirism have likely been passed down to him per Lamarckism. (The audience now understands the pregnant explorer in the opening flashback to have been Kristan''s mother.)
After Kristan''s fiance (Maxine Doyle) is attacked by an entranced Kristan, the mob of villagers assumes Zan is culpable and chases him to the edge of a cliff inside a cave. Kristan arrives and confesses to the murders, despite Zan''s protestations (aimed at saving the professor) that he, the hunchback, is in fact the murderer.  As the mob watches, Kristan throws himself over the edge of the cliff and Zan follows.','["Frank R.

('tt0017668','free','Berlin - Die Sinfonie der Großstadt (1927)','1927','1h 5min','Berlin: Symphony of a Metropolis is largely an avant-garde film, and does not have a story or a plot.  However, the events of the film are arranged to simulate the passage of a single day (simulated from an assemblage of film shot over the period of one year).  Shots and scenes are cut together based on relationships of image, motion, point of view, and thematic content.  At times, a sort of non-narrative commentary can be implied, as in edits that juxtapose workers entering a factory with cattle being beaten and driven into a corral.
The five reel film is divided into five acts, and each act is announced through a title card at the beginning and end.  One leitmotiv that is present in all of the acts, which largely connects them, is the theme of the train and streetcar.  Much of the motion in the film, and many of the scene transitions, are built around the motion of trains and streetcars.
I Akt: The first act starts the day, beginning with calm waters and a graphic representation of a sunrise.  Railroad crossing gates are lowered, a train travels through down the tracks and proceeds into the city, ending with a graphic of the "Berlin" sign approaching.  The film then transitions through calm and empty streets, to the gradual process of the city waking up.  At first, only objects are seen, such as a bit of paper blowing through an empty street, but soon a few people arise, then more are about, and the activity builds to crowds of workers going to work, pedestrians, busy streetcars, trains etc.  A hand manipulates a lever, effectively turning on the city, and factory machinery springs to life.  Glass bulbs are produced, sheets of metal are cut, molten steel is poured, smokestacks are seen against the sky, and the first act ends.
II Akt: The second act shows more of the general life of the city, beginning with the opening of gates, shutters, windows, doors, people busy cleaning, fruit carts, children going to school.  Mailmen start their day, shops open.  Different classes of people are seen, some mounting buses and streetcars, while wealthy men enter chauffeured private cars.  The city is bustling with activity.  Office workers prepare to start their day, as roll top desks open, people set out their pens, paper, open books, remove the cases from typewriters, and a bank of typists quickly erupt into activity.  Keys on keyboards spiral around one another, and a montage of a spinning hypnotist''s wheel, monkeys biting one another, telephone operators, machinery, and dogs fighting is mixed into the general busy work of the office, building quickly to a crescendo... phone receivers hang up.  End of the second act.
III Akt: The third act shows more busy street life, and a variety of people of different classes going about their business.  There are industrial workers, construction workers, salespeople, shoppers, etc.  A fight between two men breaks out briefly, but is quickly stopped by bystanders and a policeman.  There are many crowds, a father and bride arriving at a wedding, some flirtation between people on the street, a coffin on a hearse seen through the windows of a streetcar, a diplomat arrives at a ministry, the Reich President is saluted by police, a conservative students'' organization is marching with banners, an angry protester lectures a crowd, there are a few glimpses of racial minorities, lots of workers, and plenty of chaotic activity.  Trains, trains, trains, and several newspapers held up for display, dissolving over one another, bringing us to the end of the third act.
IV Akt: The fourth act starts with a lunch break.  12:00 is shown on a clock, and the spinning wheels of a factory slow to a stop.  A variety of workers leave their workplaces.  People start to eat and drink, and animals feed.  Some poignant transitions intercut a wealthy diner with a lion feeding on meat from a bone, and hungry street kids embracing their mother clothed in rags sitting out on the steps.  Many types of people eat, and some rest.  Some poor folk sleep on benches or wall ledges, while activity goes on around them.  Animals are seen resting, as an elephant lies down, a work dog tethered to a cart lies on the pavement, various zoo animals loll about.  Idle kids play.  Finally, a demanding diner in a cafe taps his spoon on a sugar bowl, and it awakens the city again, as the animals rise, then factory machinery starts up, and workers return to work.  A paper press churns out newspapers, and a man reads a paper which is held up for our view... words leap up prominently from the page, first "Krise" (crisis), then "Mord" (murder), Börse (markets), "Heirat" (marriage), and then six times "Geld... Geld...Geld" (money, money, money).  A storm of sorts arises, with the montage of revolving doors, wind, roller coasters and trains, rain, cyclones of leaves, a woman peering frantically over a rail into water, cut against P.O.V.s of roller coasters, churning water, a crowd looking down, a splash, eyes, fighting dogs, etc.  The chaos eventually subsides, and the day winds down, as workers finish their day, and recreation begins.  Children play in a lake, boats come out to race, and many kinds of races and games are displayed, finally concluding with a few romantic couples on park benches and the fall of night.
V Akt: The fifth and final act is devoted to the people''s entertainment at night.  House lights come on, then many advertising signs are lit, and people go out to the theater.  Curtains open on a variety of performances, including showgirl burlesques, trapeze artists, jugglers, singers and dancers.  Audiences gather in a movie theater, and a brief glimpse is seen of Chaplin''s distinctive feet and cane at the bottom of a movie screen.  As people leave a theater show, some sexuality is implied by a man''s hand caressing a woman''s bare arm as they enter a taxi, and her bare calf and frilly skirt are displayed.  They pull away, ignoring a child beggar, and a lit up hotel sign is next displayed.  Another montage of entertainments includes ice shows and hockey, skiers, sledders, indoor races, boxing and dance contests.  The leitmotiv of streetcars continues, and rail workers continue to work through the night.  People drink, flirt, and dance in beer halls and cocktail lounges, while card games and roulette are played.  The city starts to spin wildly, transitions into a firework display, and thus ends the final act and the film.','["Walter Ruttmann"]','["Karl Freund","Carl Mayer"]',NULL,'[""]','7.6','["tt0131468","tt0140434","tt0055715","tt0020321","tt0019760","tt0020163","tt0183710","tt0015842","tt0021576","tt0049177","tt0038107","tt0017128"]','["berlin"]','[{"url":"/BERLIN_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/BerlinSymphonyofaGreatCity_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','BerlinSymphonyofaGreatCity',211141,'Q632362','wp',NULL,NULL,'["Paul von Hindenburg"]',NULL,NULL,NULL),

Wandering through the famous haunts of tinseltown, Mooch comes across Vincent Price at the Brown Derby and ends up in his Jeep. Price wants to give the dog to a young admirer and takes Mooch to a veterinarian (James Harding) for a check-up. When his new owner leaves, Mooch is frightened by Dr. Hackett and bolts for the door, but is not able to catch up with Price driving away. 
After checking out the psychedelic scene where she  meets Phyllis Diller,  her wandering takes Mooch first to Dino''s Lounge on Sunset Strip in West Hollywood and then to the Playboy Club in downtown Los Angeles. Rejected as a Playboy bunny, but still on the lookout for famous haunts, Mooch discovers Michaelangelo''s Wigs where she has visions of a glamorous new look. Continuing on past the Classic Cat Club, Mooch encounters James Darren at an outdoor garage, and feigns an injury to get his attention. On a trip to the seashore, new adventures await with new friends.  Hoping to land a contract, Mooch tags along with two girls being discovered by a producer Jerry Hausner. Ending up back at the veterinarian, Mooch joins a wild menagerie of animals waiting for Dr. Hackett.
Placed in the veterinarian''s kennel, Mooch makes his escape and heads for Paragon Studios. On his tour of the back lots, famous catch phrases waft through the air. After interrupting a wild west shooting scene, Mooch sneaks into the dressing room of Jill St. John.

Sadoul, examining a production still from the film, identified the actor Durafour as a supporting player.While most of the film was shot indoors, the nuptial cortege scene near the end was filmed outdoors in Méliès''s garden, with a real horse.

Doris'' father, bank president Maxwell (William Farnum), embezzled $25,000 to support the drilling project. Doris and Gene''s fight heats up after he shoots out the tires on her car and she steals his horse, Champion. In an attempt to discredit Gene, Doris, who runs a radio station above Sing Low''s cafe, broadcasts him on a program sponsored by the oil company. When Gene discovers the trick, he sets out in a rage to find her.
George Wilkins (Weldon Heyburn), who is in charge of the oil well drilling, takes Doris to the drilling site and tell her the well is dry and he needs additional funds from her father to bring the well in. Doris doesn''t know that Wilkins is actually trying to swindle her father by getting him to pay for all of the equipment while he stalls the drilling. Wilkins intends to take over the lease on the profitable land when the bank''s lease runs out.
While taking the payroll to the drilling site, Wilkins and Doris are held up by two thieves, who are actually Wilkins'' henchmen. Gene comes to the rescue and grudgingly returns the money to Doris, who continues on to the drilling site. Wilkins reprimands his men for getting caught and then lets them go. Doris and Gene return to the bank, where they discover Maxwell has tried to commit suicide after receiving a letter notifying him that the bank examiner would be arriving soon. Protecting Maxwell from embezzlement charges, Gene makes it seem as if Maxwell was shot during a robbery.
Sometime later, Gene learns that the railroad will go through the town if the oil comes in, and he informs Wilkins that he will publicly support the drilling. Not wanting any public attention on his operation, Wilkins orders his men to hold Gene captive until after the lease is transferred to him. Gene escapes and alerts the townspeople to Wilkins'' crooked dealings. Wilkins spreads a rumor that Gene intentionally swindled his friends by making them buy worthless oil stock, and later tells a crowd that Gene was behind the bank robbery. A mob gathers and goes after Gene who is forced to flee.
At the oil well, Gene finds Sam Brown, an oil worker who was shot by Wilkins after he discovered that the well only needed to be dynamited to come in. After getting a doctor to treat Sam, Gene and Frog Millhouse (Smiley Burnette) dynamite the well, despite the opposition from Wilkins and the crowd. Following the blast, the well comes in and soon the oil company, now called the Maxwell-Autry company, is prospering. Gene distributes dividends to his friends on their investment, and Frog, who has been searching for an addition to his butterfly collection, discovers a poor specimen.','["Joseph Kane"]','["Dorrell McGowan","Stuart E.

At the site, the group encounters the abandoned truck of a forest ranger, the ranger''s hat, and an alien spacecraft that resembles a camping trailer; a large, slow-moving, slug-like creature had earlier emerged from the craft, and departed prior to the group''s arrival. Believing the absent ranger might be inside, Ben enters the craft by crawling underneath it. Shortly thereafter loud screams, along with growls like those of a lion, are heard from the craft, after which Martin radios for help.
In response to Martin''s request for assistance, a "special unit" of military troops, commanded by Col. James Caldwell (John Caresio) and traveling in the back of a light-duty, civilian truck arrives at the site. Two of the troops enter the craft, examine its contents, and report back to Caldwell the presence inside of a large, tethered creature. The next day, "the world''s leading authority on space emissions," Dr. Bradford (William Thourlby), arrives to direct the ongoing investigation, which includes examination of the creature and the spacecraft''s analog devices. As the investigation proceeds, the departed creature stalks the countryside and, despite its markedly awkward and slow pace of ambulation, successfully approaches, attacks and devours a bikini-clad girl, a housewife hanging laundry, Grandpa Brown (Jack King) and his grandson Bobby (Pierre Kopp), picnickers at a "hootenanny" (one of whom attempts to stop the creature by swatting it with a guitar), the patrons at a community dance hall (at which time some attendees engage each other in fisticuffs), and couples in their cars at a lovers'' lane (about which the film''s narrator states that "anyone who experienced that catastrophe, and survived, would never go there again.")
Following the lover''s lane incident, Caldwell orders his troops to attack the creature, telling Bradford that the creature would be captured alive if possible. This attack is accomplished by the troops standing close together, walking slowly toward the creature as a unit, and firing their small caliber firearms. The attack proves ineffective, however, and failing to retreat or otherwise walk away, all but two of the troops are devoured. Caldwell then decides to throw a live grenade, with the resultant explosion destroying the creature. After briefly examining the dead creature''s tissue, Bradford hurriedly returns to the spacecraft and therein somehow triggers an explosion. Although this explosion mortally injures Bradford, it does not damage the craft or its instrumentation, and it allows the tethered creature to exit. As the creature prepares to devour Bradford, it is killed in a collision with Martin''s arriving police car. Bradford then explains to Martin and Brett that the creatures were "mobile" laboratories designed to consume human beings, analyze the bodies chemically to detect weaknesses, and from the spacecraft transmit the acquired information into outer space. Although Martin fails to destroy the spacecraft''s transmitter equipment, the dying Bradford says that the creatures'' home planet might not even exist anymore, concluding that "only God knows for sure."','["Vic Savage"]',NULL,'["Vic Savage","Shannon O''Neil","William Thourlby"]','["Horror","Sci-Fi"]','2.1','["tt1686027","tt0052646","tt0045609","tt0046248","tt0053311","tt0083959","tt0054691","tt0026685","tt0047149","tt0265870","tt0058208","tt0050147"]','["sci fi; horror; alien monsters; Vic Savage; Shannon O''Neil; William Thourlby"]','[{"url":"/TheCreepingTerror.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/TheCreepingTerror_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','TheCreepingTerror',11054,'Q2086470','wp','["Robert Silliphant"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

At one point, Tim takes the wheel, and accidentally drives into the curb, unhinging the trailer, sending it down the road and crashing into the sheriff''s car. All three get arrested and sent to a local jail. Tim gets to share cells with a man named Spike Kenny. When Spike''s boss Farrell comes to bail him out, he recognizes Tim from a high riser construction site and bails him out too.
Tim is offered a job at the new plant being built at the construction site, and Tim accepts the offer, but only to impress Marian, whom he has taken a liking to. Spike has taken an interest in Cassie.
Tim starts working as a chipper - a metal worker - and meets his work mate Bill Madden, a man who blames Tim for his brother''s death. Bill''s brother fell down from construction in a high rise, and pulled Tim with him in the fall. Tim only survived because he landed on top of bill''s brother.
Marian and Cassie are quite successful with their lunch trailer, and both women are invited to the Boilerman''s Ball, by Rod and Spike respectively. Marian dares Tim to go up in one of the plant towers, fully aware he has trouble with heights, and Rod has to escort him down again. When Tim explains how he obtained his vertigo, Marian warms up to him.
One day there is a gas leak at the plant and Tim manages to save Jeff''s life when the gas is ignited by a spark from his car. Tim still gets the blame for the leak, but Marian stands up for him and takes him out on a date. They take a liking to each other and when Tim asks her to the ball she accepts.
During the ball, Bill happens to overhear Marian when she explains she is only daring Tim out of pity. To get back at Tim, Bill tells him what he heard. Tim is furious and picks a fight with Bill, and the fighting spreads among the rest of the workers. Soon the sheriff arrives and arrests all of the people involved in the fighting.
This time Rod is reluctant to bail the other workers out of jail, but continues the work with a handful of workers left. He changes his mind and decides to bail out Tim when he hears that Bill was the one responsible for the fight. However, both Tim and Spike has escaped jail already and are on their way to get work somewhere else.

He lets one of the homeless, Dave Williams, to live with him, and goes on to ask the city to build housing for the poor. He realizes that it is the powerful Mrs. Norma Stewart that has the last say in the matter since it is her property they would build on.
Mrs. Stewart has long been in love with Dr. Christian, and sends her two wards Jack and Ruth Williams to him, with the deed and a letter with the conditions under which she will donate the property to the city, which is that the good doctor agrees to marry her.  However, the message is not delivered, since the children throws away the letter, and the doctor only gets the deed.
Too late does the doctor realize the price he must pay for the property, and the city also backs out on their agreement to build housing for the poor and homeless. The result is that the homeless have nowhere to go, and have to move into another vacant lot with no proper housing.

When he wakes up, he discovers marks on his throat, a strange key and a button in his pocket, and blood on his cuff. Cliff Herlihy (Paul Kelly), his police officer brother-in-law, tries to convince him it was just a dream.
A few days later, while trying to find cover from the rain, the pair finds themselves taking shelter in the strange house from Vince''s dream. They discover that the police found two bodies in the house, one in the mirrored room and one run over in the driveway. Mrs. Belknap, who was run over by a car, gave the police a description matching Vince before she died.
At first Vince is hopeful that he is innocent because he does not know how to drive, but he recognizes the victims from his dream. Overcome with remorse, he attempts suicide, but is rescued by Cliff. The detective uncovers clues that point to an evil hypnotist (Robert Emmett Keane) manipulating Vince. They realize that the hypnotist is actually Mr. Belknap in disguise and try to trap him by pretending that Vince wants hush money.
Belknap puts Vince under hypnosis and tries to get him to drown himself. Cliff rescues him from the lake and Mr. Belknap is killed in a car accident as he is trying to evade the police. It is implied that Vince will be acquitted of all charges since he killed the man in the mirrored room in self-defense.','["Maxwell Shane"]','["Cornell Woolrich","Maxwell Shane"]','["Paul Kelly","DeForest Kelley","Ann Doran"]','["Crime","Drama","Film-Noir","Mystery","Thriller"]','6.4','["tt0040472","tt0039730","tt0043390","tt0052695","tt0038986","tt0049621","tt0041187","tt0040695","tt0040153","tt0036745","tt0038640","tt0038990"]','["Film-Noir; Mystery; De Forest Kelley"]','[{"url":"/Fear_in_the_Night.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Fear_in_the_Night_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/Fear_in_the_Night_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','Fear_in_the_Night',67498,'Q5227887','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Trudy believes the dreams are real. Her boyfriend Johnny Bruder (John Ashley) does not, nor do her friends Suzie Lawler (Sally Todd) and Don (Harold Lloyd Jr.). Little does Trudy know, but she actually does turn into a monster at night, thanks to Carter''s unpleasant lab assistant Oliver Frank (Donald Murphy). He lives with them, works in Carter''s home lab and has been spiking Trudy''s fruit punch with the formula that he and Carter are developing. Carter''s goal is to eliminate all disease so that people can live forever; Oliver''s goal is something quite different.
Carter''s project stalls and he breaks into Rockwell Labs for Digenerol, the chemical he needs for his experiments. He does not know who Oliver actually is or that, with the help of Elsu the gardener (Wolfe Barzell), Oliver is secretly assembling what he calls a "perfect being", for Oliver Frank is actually Oliver Frankenstein, grandson of the original Dr. Frankenstein.
Police Lt. Boyd (John Zaremba) and Det. Bill Dillon (Robert Dix) investigate a report from a frightened woman (Charlotte Portney) that a female monster in a swimsuit attacked her. It is, of course, Trudy. They spot her and fire a few shots but miss. Oliver grabs her and drags her home to recover.
The next morning Carter asks Oliver if he has seen the newspaper story about a "Frankenstein monster" on the loose. Oliver scoffs at the story, but when Carter disparages the Frankensteins, Oliver literally jumps to his feet in their defense. Boyd and Dillon are visited by Mr. Rockwell (Voltaire Perkins) of Rockwell Labs. Rockwell says that the stolen Digenerol may be somehow related to the monster issue.
Back at the home lab, Elsu mistakenly enters through a secret door while Carter and Oliver are working. Oliver silently shoos him out and to distract Carter knocks the bottle of Digenerol from his hand, spilling every drop. Carter says that he must now steal more Digenerol.
Suzie visits Trudy, but they quarrel and as Suzi flounces off she makes a date with Oliver. The date goes badly, with Oliver attempting to force himself on Suzie. Since he needs a brain for his perfect being, he runs Suzie over with his car, killing her. Oliver will create a female perfect being, something the Frankensteins have never tried before. When Elsu asks why, Oliver says that "now we''re aware the female mind is conditioned to a man''s world. It therefore takes orders, where the other ones didn''t." In awe, Elsu exclaims, "Frankenstein''s daughter!" after which they always refer to it in the feminine.
While Oliver tries to reanimate "her", Boyd and Dillon arrive. As they tell Oliver that they suspect Carter is the Digenerol thief, "she" (Harry Wilson) comes to life, hideously scarred and looking not in the least like pretty, blonde Suzie. After the police leave, "she" escapes and kills a warehouse worker (Bill Coontz). Another worker, Mack (George Barrows), calls the cops.
At the house, Trudy and Oliver are talking when someone knocks on the front door. Trudy answers. It is the monster. Trudy screams and faints. Elsu coaxes "her" into the lab. When Johnny arrives and tells him what happened, Oliver convinces Johnny that Trudy has an overactive imagination.
Oliver wants the lab for himself and decides to kill Carter. But as he starts strangling him, Boyle and Dillon show up with more questions about the Digenerol. Oliver tells them that Carter stole it; Carter tells them that Oliver tried to kill him. Oliver persuades them that Carter is mentally ill, and they arrest Carter. Oliver then argues with Elsu, who refuses any further assistance, and Oliver has "her" kill Elsu. Afterwards, Oliver tells Trudy and Johnny that Carter has been arrested. When Johnny leaves for the police station, Trudy stays behind. Oliver reveals that his name is actually Frankenstein, not Frank, and shows her his creation again. Trudy faints once more, but awakens and goes to the police station herself. Boyle tells her and Johnny that Carter has died.
Boyle and Dillon return to the house to further question Oliver. When Boyle leaves, Dillon stays behind to keep an eye on Oliver. Dillon stumbles across "her" hiding place in the house and Oliver orders "her" to kill Dillon.
Trudy and Johnny come home and also find the monster''s hideout. Oliver orders "her" to kill them, too. "She" and Johnny fight in the lab. Johnny throws a vial of acid at "her," but hits Oliver instead, melting his face. As Oliver falls screaming to the floor, the monster accidentally sets "herself" alight on a Bunsen burner. Trudy and Johnny flee as "she" is consumed by flames.','["Richard E.

Kendrick refuses, preferring to mate the stallion with his own stock. Brett Scoville (Jack Holt), a wealthy rancher and nightclub owner, wants to mate the stallion with his mare, as well, and to that end, steals the stallion. Golden Sovereign breaks free, finds Lady, and has a romantic interlude with her in the hills.
A search is raised to find Golden Sovereign, but Scoville accidentally shoots and kills the horse when Golden Sovereign is attacked by a wild stallion. Roy arrives on the scene and chases Scoville off, but cannot later identify him as the killer. To all appearances, it looks like Roy is responsible for the death of Golden Sovereign, and he is arrested. He jumps bail, and takes off on Lady. Months later, Lady gives birth to Golden Sovereign''s son. Roy names him Trigger and, in time, the horse becomes his mount.
Roy returns to the Golden Horse Ranch to present Trigger as a gift to Kendrick. The gift is declined, and Roy is jailed as a fugitive from justice. Trigger is auctioned to pay Roy''s debts. Scoville acquires the horse and, when the case against Roy is dropped, hires him to train Trigger.
A year later, Scoville and Susan Kendrick (Dale Evans) enter their horses in a race at the State Fair. Roy is riding Scoville''s Trigger in the race, and Scoville promises him ownership of the horse should he win the race. Roy is reluctant to race after learning Scoville killed Golden Sovereign. However, Roy races and aids Susan when Scoville''s men hold her horse in a pocket on the track. Susan wins the race on Golden Empress, and, consequently, Roy loses possession of Trigger. Later, Scoville is arrested for killing Golden Sovereign, and, Roy finally comes into possession of Trigger through Kendrick.

While delivering newspapers on his route one day, Mike meets newcomer Colonel Whitley, a famous Kentucky horse breeder who has just leased a horse training farm in the area. Jimmy, a horse racing buff, eagerly introduces himself to the colonel and his horse trainer, James Spencer, and asks if he can watch the colonel''s horses work out. The next morning, Spencer gives Jimmy and his friend Speck a tour of the stables. When Jimmy boasts that Mike could beat the colonel''s thoroughbreds, the colonel gruffly insults Mike''s ability, causing Jimmy to challenge him to a race. After Mike nearly beats his reigning champion, the colonel, humbled, apologizes and invites Jimmy to breakfast. At the dining table, Jimmy relates the story of how his uncle Joe bought Mike from a famous horse breeder after the man''s daughter, Mike''s owner, unexpectedly died. Jimmy is saving money from his paper route to pay his uncle for the horse. As Jimmy breakfasts with the colonel, a letter arrives at the Dolan house from his uncle, informing the boy that he plans to sell Mike to a racing stable for $700. When Jimmy, who has only saved $200, learns of his uncle''s intentions, his sympathetic sister Erin suggests he make the horse unappealing to his prospective buyers. The next morning, when the representatives from the stable arrive to inspect Mike, Jimmy coats the horse with mud and instructs him to act lame. The stablemen see through the ruse, however, and while the boy is at school they return to claim the horse. At his new home, Mike refuses to eat or train, and when the stablemen inform his new owner, movie star Kitty Tremaine, that the horse is lonesome for Corky, she decides to visit the Dolan house and buy the dog. When Kitty learns how heartbroken Jimmy is over Mike''s loss, she agrees to sell back the horse, and to finance the deal, Jimmy offers Spencer half ownership in Mike. After Spencer and Jimmy become partners, Spencer warns Jimmy to avoid Erin''s beau, William "Sandy" McKay, a jockey who was disbarred for allegedly throwing a race. When Jimmy questions Sandy about the allegations, Sandy replies that he was innocent but never defended himself against his accusers. Satisfied with Sandy''s explanation, Jimmy asks him to ride Mike in the horse''s first race at Santa Anita. Meanwhile, a syndicate of gamblers pools its resources to bet on Speed Demon, who they deem to be a sure winner in the race. When Mike wins the race, he upsets the syndicate''s plans and makes headlines as "The Great Mike." Spencer and Jimmy then decide to enter Mike in a handicap race, and when the syndicate learns of their plans, it hires Doc Slagle and his brother Bill to put the horse out of commission. One night, the pair sneak into Mike''s stable, armed with a hypodermic needle filled with poison. Corky springs to Mike''s defense, and when Jimmy hears the dog''s growls coming from the barn, he calls Spencer for help. By the time Spencer arrives, however, the Slagles have killed Corky and fled, leaving behind the unused hypodermic needle bearing their fingerprints. Grieving over Corky''s loss, Mike again refuses to train or eat, forcing his withdrawal from the race. One day, after the Slagles have been arrested for their crime, Junior, Jimmy''s friend, appears at the stable with news that his family is to be transferred out of state. Junior offers to sell Jimmy Corky''s brother Mickey, and when Mickey and Mike begin to cavort, Jimmy realizes that Mike is ready to race again. Spencer and Jimmy enter Mike in a race against the colonel''s champion horse, and when Mike wins the race, he earns the colonel''s admiration and a generous purse, which Jimmy uses to finance a newsboys'' clubhouse. Carl "Alfalfa" Switzer make a rare post Little Rascals appearance as Jimmy''s dim-witted friend, Speck. And that''s about what he is. Switzer''s dialogue consists of little more than saying "Gee willikers" or words to that effect over and over and over again and grinning like he''s still 8 years old.

He is so upset, he changes the pacing of the pips to play "Shave and a Haircut". He tries to resign, but he cannot do that during wartime, so since he also wants to avoid all women, he is assigned the solitary job of sending weather reports from a remote Scottish lighthouse. Before taking a boat from the mainland, his is warned by the locals that he will go mad from the isolation and the curse of a mermaid within a month, as his predecessors have.
Pilbeam has his peace quickly shattered when he encounters Jane, a young girl (who stowed away on the boat that brought him to the island), and then Bobbie, a model and the sole survivor of a torpedoed ship. His radio disappears, and Bobbie sees one man tied up, but he disappears when she brings Pilbeam. Then she is attacked, but her assailant is also nowhere to be seen when Pilbeam returns. Finally, another boatload of women (plus a couple of crewmen) arrive from Bobbie''s ship. Things become crowded in the lighthouse, until people start to mysteriously disappear during the night, leaving an anxious Pilbeam to discover what has been happening to everyone and why. Finally, only Pilbeam is left.
It turns out that Nazi agents have been secretly sweeping the waters of mines and have taken everyone else prisoner, leaving Pilbeam free just so he can send away a rescue party without arousing suspicion. But between Pilbeam, Jane''s uncle (from the neighboring island) and the women, they manage to turn the tables on their captors. They tie the Germans up and set out on the German boat.

From the start, Berlin found Edmund Goulding, the director, difficult to work with. Also by mid-1930 the studio realized that the public''s demand for musicals had disappeared. So Goulding jettisoned many of Berlin''s songs from the score. Although just five Berlin songs had been recorded, the film, even in its scaled-down form, proved very expensive to make. By the time the filming was complete, the costs had come to about a million dollars, a huge budget for the times, and one that virtually ruled out the possibility of the film returning a profit.The one song that was retained was "When the Folks High Up Do the Mean Low Down" introduced by Bing Crosby who had filmed it late at night after completing his work at the Cocoanut Grove.Variety commented on this song specifically, saying: "None of the Berlin songs is left other than a chorus of hot numbers apparently named "Lower Than Lowdown" [sic]. Tune suddenly breaks into the running in the ship''s bar when Bing Crosby, of the Whiteman Rhythm Boys, gives it a strong start for just a chorus which, in turn, is ably picked up by Miss Daniels, also for merely a chorus, and then in an exterior shot to the deck where June MacCloy sends the lyric and melody for a gallop of half a chorus.','["Edmund Goulding"]','["Irving Berlin","Edmund Goulding"]','["Douglas Fairbanks","Bebe Daniels","Edward Everett Horton"]','["Comedy","Romance"]','5.6','["tt0025681","tt0026205","tt0020030","tt0020479","tt0028505","tt0029650","tt0027286","tt0030973","tt0022402","tt0023369","tt0011439","tt0018876"]','["Comedy; Romance; Musical"]','[{"url":"/ReachingForTheMoon-1930-douglasFairbanksBebeDanielsEdwardEverettHortonBingCrosby.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/ReachingForTheMoondecember291930_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','ReachingForTheMoondecember291930',15937,'Q7300225','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

His love interest is a landlord''s daughter, named Li Xiaoxia, but this love is strongly opposed by her father. Tang Jun, a thug and suitor of Xiaoxia, pours nitric acid onto Song Danping out of jealousy, permanently disfiguring his face and hands, turning him into a "monster". Troubled by his appearance, Song spreads the rumor of his own death. Xiaoxia becomes emotionally and mentally disturbed at the news of Song''s death. Song lives in the seclusion of the theatre attic, only coming out to sing every midnight, comforting an ill Xiaoxia with his song.
Ten years later, a play troupe comes to the theatre to perform. One night, while young actor Sun Xiaoou is practicing in the theatre, Song offers him guidance through singing. Song Danping’s “Song of the Night” helps the troupe in their performance the next day. Wanting to thank the “Phantom”, Xiaoou tracks the source of the singer through his singing, leading him to the attic, where he meets Song. Song tells Sun about his experience in detail, and shows his face to Sun, causing Sun strong grief and resonance. They eventually become friends.
After another three years, business is sluggish and the troupe faces disbandment. When Xiaoou goes to bid farewell to Song Danping, Song takes out the already-modified "Hot Blood" script, a play that he wrote in his early years and promises that the troupe will be able to return to life with this drama. As promised, the troupe succeeds with "Hot Blood", and Xiaoou goes to thank Song Danping. Danping asks Xiaoou to visit Xiaoxia, whom he is too embarrassed to meet due to his disfiguration. Xiaoou reveals that his own sweetheart is the troupe actress Ludie, "Green Butterfly" (绿蝶). Xiaoou is impressed by Danping''s true feelings and promises to meet Xiaoxia disguised as Danping. Xiaoxia sees "Dan Ping" and is greatly overjoyed. A few days later, Tang Jun, who caused Song''s disfigurement 13 years ago, covets Ludie when he is watching the play. After the play, Tang follows her backstage. Ludie refused his advances and points out that she only belongs to Sun Xiaoou. As Tang tries to force himself on her Xiaoou arrives and pulls Tang away from her. Tang draws his pistol at Xiaoou. In order to protect her lover, Ludie blocks Xiaoou and is shot. The gunshot attracts Song Danping, who is hiding in the background. Song proceeds to fight with Tang Jun. The fighting continues into the top floor, where Danping confessed: "I was killed by you 13 years ago." Tang is stunned by the face of Song, and falls from the top floor.
The incident attracts a crowd of people, who assumes Danping a monster after seeing his impaired face. The mob proceeds to launch an attack on Danping in an attempt to rid themselves of the monster (除妖 chúyāo). Xiaoou tries to explain the situation to the crowd, but his pleas fell on deaf ears. He finds Xiaoxia and explains to her that he was pretending to be Danping, and the real DanPing quietly accompanied her for thirteen years in secret. XiaoOu explains that this might be the last time she could see him alive which causes her to lose consciousness.
DanPing cannot escape the fiery mob, and eventually commits suicide by drowning himself in the river close by. Xiaoou keeps Xiaoxia company until she regains consciousness a few hours later. When asked to recall their prior conversation, she describes everything as just a very long dream. Xiaoou, unable to bear Xiaoxia experiencing further heartbreak, continues to impersonate Danping, and they live the rest of their lives as a couple.','["Weibang Ma-Xu"]','["Gaston Leroux","Weibang Ma-Xu"]','["Menghe Gu","Ping Hu","Shan Jin"]','[""]','6.3','["tt0028201","tt0048121","tt0189219","tt0195256","tt0036135","tt0129222","tt0026866","tt0030522","tt0117968","tt0047495","tt0028358","tt0032156"]','["China;Horror"]','[{"url":"/song_at_midnight.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/song_at_midnight_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/song_at_midnight_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','song_at_midnight',21771,'Q4274245','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Sheriff Aaron Whitaker (David Janssen) is called. The victim''s temperamental brother Lawrence Burrifors (Geoffrey Lewis) arrives at the crime scene and jumps to the conclusion that the girl''s lover committed the murder, a man whose name her brother does not know. The town''s Dr. Drutan (John Beradino) examines the body and concludes that the girl died from a blow to the head.
The sheriff investigates the crime and local residents have a variety of theories, including the belief she was killed by wild dogs. A posse forms to track down the wild dogs with little success. Burrifors continues to insist the killer to be his sister''s mysterious lover while the sheriff, in turn, is suspicious of him. The girl''s sick and dying father Hugh Burrifors, interviewed by the sheriff, warns him of the "Loug Garog". The sheriff does not understand the French term.
The sheriff''s investigation soon takes him to the plantation home of the wealthy Andrew Rodanthe and his sister Louise (Bradford Dillman, Barbara Rush). They are the last of a local family dynasty. Andrew, who the sheriff suspects had an affair with the victim, claims to have been suffering an attack of malaria the night the girl was killed.
The sheriff, suspicious of the temperamental brother Lawrence after he assaults the town doctor, who turns out to be the mysterious lover, puts him in jail. While there, the full moon rises again and Lawrence and the sheriff''s deputy are killed in a vicious attack after the steel bars of the cell are torn from the wall.
With the town''s residents fearful and the sheriff without assistance, Andrew Rodanthe volunteers to become deputy. Andrew and the sheriff return to Hugh Burrifor''s house and discover the old man has created a voodoo potion that gives off a vapor meant to repel the "Loug Garog". Rodanthe inhales the potion and goes into what appears to be an epileptic seizure. He is taken to the hospital.
While there, Andrew''s sister Louise tells the sheriff she can speak French fluently and would talk to Hugh Burrifor about the unexplainable term "Loug Garog". While speaking with the old man, Louise solves the puzzle. "Loug Garog" is a mispronunciation of "Loup Garou". Translated into English the term means "werewolf".
Transformed into a werewolf, Andrew violently escapes the hospital and becomes the subject of a manhunt. As a posse gathers, Louise runs to the mayor, telling him that her brother is sick and that there are drugs that can help him. At her and Andrew''s home, Louise talks to Sheriff Whitaker about werewolf folklore. She reveals a family secret, that her grandfather used to suffer from unusual spells of sickness, implying he was also a werewolf and Andrew''s curse was inherited.
Louise returns to her plantation home alone and Andrew, still in his werewolf form, enters the house. Louise flees to the barn. When the werewolf follows she attempts to set him afire, then returns to the house. Andrew escapes the fire and pursues Louise. She eventually shoots him just as the sheriff returns. After he dies, Andrew returns to his human form.','["Daniel Petrie"]','["Alvin Sapinsley","Les Whitten"]','["David Janssen","Barbara Rush","Bradford Dillman"]','["Horror","Thriller"]','5.0','["tt0072128","tt0122070","tt0076731","tt0067221","tt0067977","tt0069461","tt0078203","tt0027194","tt0049944","tt0070458","tt0075917","tt0475937"]','["Horror; Mystery; Thriller"]','[{"url":"/MoonoftheWolf.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/MoonoftheWolf_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/MoonoftheWolf__archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','MoonoftheWolf_',38883,'Q6907619','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Baron Frankenstein''s daughter Tania (Rosalba Neri) arrives from school, having completed her studies in medicine, and is greeted by her father and his young servant, the handsome but mildly intellectually disabled Thomas (Marino Masé).  Tania reveals to her father that she has always understood his work with "animal transplants" to be a cover for his work reanimating corpses, and that she intends to follow in his footsteps and help him in his work.
The next day, Frankenstein, Tania, and Marshall witness the execution of a criminal who is hanged down a well, Frankenstein and Marshall both have an eye toward harvesting the criminal''s body for their experimentation. Law enforcement agent Captain Harris (Mickey Hargitay) arrives to harass Lynch at the hanging.  Harris claims to be on to Lynch''s grave robbing.
That evening, having harvested salient body parts, Frankenstein and Marshall successfully reanimate a gruesome giant corpse with a scarred, misshapen head (Peter Whiteman) as Tania secretly watches. Almost instantly, however, this monster bear-hugs Frankenstein to death - breaking his back - then walks out of the castle. Tania and Marshall report the murder to Harris, but claim that it was a burglar. Harris points out that according to their description, the burglar would be over seven feet tall.
The monster, roaming the countryside, comes across a couple having sex out in the open, and after scaring away the man, picks up the woman, who screams and then faints. The monster then carries her later body and drops it into a river, and when the body is later found by two men, the monster kills one by breaking his neck. After Harris questions Lynch, and Lynch refuses Tania''s offer for more grave-robbing work, the monster breaks into Lynch''s home while he is having sex with a local whore, and kills Lynch by beating him to death. The monster then kills a local farmer and his wife, and Lynch''s two grave-robbing friends.
Tania then goads Marshall into admitting harboring romantic feelings for her. She responds to his affections, but says that while Marshall''s body is old, she finds the body of Thomas young and attractive. The "solution" to this situation will be to transplant Marshall''s brilliant brain into the brain-damaged Thomas''s young healthy body. To accomplish this, Tania seduces Thomas into having sex while Marshall secretly watches, and Marshall kills him with a pillow during their lovemaking.
Tania then successfully transplants Marshall''s brain into Thomas'' body. Thomas now speaks with Marshall''s voice and his body has become inhumanly strong as well. Meanwhile, Frankenstein''s monster has continued to terrorize the town, and the local villagers, having had enough, arrive with torches and pitchforks before following the monster to the castle. In the chaos, the monster returns, knocks down Harris, and has a fight with Marshall/Thomas, who cuts off his arm. When the monster bear-hugs Marshall/Thomas, Tania stabs him in the back with a sword, and Marshall/Thomas kills him by puncturing his head open with a metal hand tool. The monster is defeated, but Tania has made it clear that she has no allegiance to Marshall.
The villagers storm into the castle and set it aflame in the hopes of killing the monster. Harris arrives with Thomas''s sister Julia (Renate Kasché) to see Tania and Marshall/Thomas naked and enjoying post-fight sexual intercourse as the castle burns beside them.

('tt0054691','free','Bloodlust! (1961)','1961','1h 8min','Two couples - Betty and Johnny (June Kenney and Robert Reed), and Jeanne and Pete (Joan Lora and Eugene Persson) - are vacationing at sea together. When the ship''s captain passes out drunk, they decide to go to a nearby jungle island. As they depart, Capt. Tony (Troy Patterson) awakens and calls out, warning them not to.
As they explore the island, Johnny falls into a pit. The others start pulling him out, but look up to see Dr. Balleau (Wilton Graff) and two servants. Balleau orders the servants to help get Johnny out.
That night at his house, Balleau tells the couples that he moved to the island "after the war" to indulge his passion for hunting. Both couples want to leave, but Balleau says they can not because wild animals prowl the jungle. Ballaeu makes his wife Sandra (Lilyan Chauvin) show Betty and Jeanne to the guestroom, while Balleau''s servant Jondor (Bobby Hall) escorts Johnny and Pete to their room.
A bit later, Sandra and houseguest Dean Gerard (Walter Brooke), who are lovers, discuss Dean''s latest plan for their escape. Meanwhile, Johnny and Pete go to Betty and Jeanne''s room to talk about their situation. They decide to poke about the house. Betty and Johnny are stopped by Sandra and Dean, who take them back to the guestroom. Jeanne and Pete find a tunnel. They hide as a servant walks into a room. When he leaves, Jeanne and Pete go in and discover a vat of bubbling acid. They hide again when the servant returns and are horrified when he reveals a woman''s body floating in an aquarium. The servant leaves again. Jeanne and Pete go back to the guestroom to tell the others what they have seen.
Dean tells them his escape plan. He and Sandra will slip out of the house, steal a boat, go to the mainland and then come back with help. But as they sneak through the front gate, Balleau, toting a spear, follows.
Two days pass. No one has seen Balleau or heard from Sandra and Dean. As Betty and Johnny discuss this, a servant enters the room. They hide as the servant walks through a secret door. When he comes out, they go in. There they discover Balleau and his "trophies" - the mounted bodies of people he has hunted, Sandra and Dean among them. By way of explanation, Balleau tells Betty and Johnny that he was a sniper during the war. At first he detested sniping, he says, but then began to enjoy it, and soon the enjoyment "turned into a lust - a lust for blood!"
As Balleau tells both couples that he will hunt Johnny and Pete, Jondor comes in dragging Capt. Tony behind him. Balleau adds Tony to the hunt for failing to bring Balleau sufficient inmates from the "penal island." Balleau says he will hunt only the three men. Betty and Jeanne will stay with him and now that Sandra is dead, he is "looking forward to getting to know [them] better ... much better."
Jondor locks the girls in the guestroom. Balleau says that he will carry a crossbow and only three arrows, one for each man, To make things more "sporting", he tosses Tony a pistol and says they will find ammunition in the "Tree of Death." But they find just one bullet. Tony runs off with it, leaving Johnny and Pete to fend for themselves. When Tony attempts to shoot Balleau, the gun will not fire. Balleau has removed the firing pin. He kills Tony.
After escaping from the guestroom, Betty and Jeanne enter the tunnel Pete and Jeanne had found earlier. They go into the room with vat of acid, hoping to arm themselves with knives, but a servant comes in. He and Betty tussle and Betty, the daughter of a judo expert, judo-flips the servant into the acid, where he dissolves, screaming in agony.
The girls head into the jungle, looking for Johnny and Pete. Balleau and Jondor are still hunting the boys when Jondor falls into a leech-filled pond. Balleau leaves him to drown. Betty and Jeanne find Johnny and Pete. They head for Balleau''s house, planning to use his rifles against him. They find rifles, but no ammunition. They are defenseless.
Balleau finds the couples hiding in his trophy room. Holding them at gunpoint, he poses them in the tableau they will be in after he has killed them. Suddenly, Jondor, covered with leeches, bursts in. Jondor grips Balleau in a bear hug and, as Balleau screams, impales him on a cross, killing him.','["Ralph Brooke"]',NULL,'["Wilton Graff","June Kenney","Walter Brooke"]','["Horror","Thriller"]','3.5','["tt0033787","tt0035784","tt0057569","tt0035009","tt0023236","tt0049363","tt0074920","tt0032215","tt0040829","tt0054033","tt0023694","tt0036653"]','["murder; suspense; Ralph Reed; MST3K"]','[{"url":"/Bloodlust.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Bloodlust.mpeg_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/Bloodlust_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','Bloodlust.mpeg',28349,'Q2957968','wp','["Ralph Brooke"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

While driving to his family''s country house, Cortner and his beautiful fiancée Jan Compton (Virginia Leith) get into a car accident that decapitates Jan. Cortner recovers her severed head and rushes to his country house basement laboratory. He and his crippled assistant Kurt (Anthony La Penna) revive the head in a liquid-filled tray. But Jan''s new existence is agony, and she begs Cortner to let her die. He ignores her pleas, and she grows to resent him.
Cortner decides to commit murder to obtain a body for Jan. He hunts for a suitable specimen at a burlesque nightclub, on the streets, and at a beauty contest. She begins communicating telepathically with a hideous mutant, an experiment gone wrong, locked in a laboratory cell. When Kurt leaves a hatch in the cell door unlocked, the monster grabs and tears off Kurt''s arm. Kurt dies from his injuries.
Cortner lures an old girlfriend, figure model Doris Powell (Adele Lamont), to his house, promising to study her scarred face for plastic surgery. He drugs her and carries her to the laboratory. Jan protests Cortner''s plan to transplant her head onto Doris''s body. He tapes Jan''s mouth shut.
When Cortner goes to quiet the monster, it grabs Cortner through the hatch and breaks the door from its hinges. Their struggles set the laboratory ablaze. The monster (Eddie Carmel), a seven-foot giant with a horribly deformed head, bites a chunk from Cortner''s neck. Cortner dies, and the monster carries the unconscious Doris to safety. As the lab goes up in flames, Jan says, "I told you to let me die."

('tt0073418','free','Murder on Flight 502 (1975)','1975','1h 37min','Flight 502 takes off from New York City to London. At the airport, a bomb threat in the airline''s first-class passenger lobby turns out to be just an elaborate prank smoke bomb disguised as a more sinister explosive time bomb. In relief that the incident is just a prank Donaldson complains how this needlessly caused him stress on his weekend off work, to which the bomb technician derisively states how much more stressful the call to the bomb scare was for him because he was at a motel when he was called and thought it was his wife calling trying to reach him, implying he thought he had been caught in tryst with someone other than his wife.
As the stress has momentarily passed this leads the assistant to Head of Security, Robert Davenport,
to fortuitously presenting him with a letter found in his desk in-box he would not have received until the next morning. The letter explains that a series of murders will take place on Flight 502 before it lands. Robert Davenport notifies Captain Larkin, via the airline''s direct radio channel. Donaldson and his team go over the backgrounds of all the passengers to find possible suspects, which irritates Larkin for the lack of details, causing him to be terse with an equally aggravated Donaldson who is none the happier for being talked down to while nursing a painful toothache. In the air, Captain Larkin, off duty Police Officer Daniel Myerson, and flight attendant Karen White look for suspicious passengers. 
At first teenage passenger Millard Kensington is suspected because he has a history with the airline as a known prankster who clogged a previous flight''s toilets with 13 sponges he carried aboard. He is suspected of placing the fake bomb in the first class passenger lobby in New York is now on Flight 502. After confronting the teenager regarding the seriousness of his actions and getting him to admit he did place the fake bomb in the airline passenger lobby, he is nevertheless apparently clueless about the serious nature of the found letter. Realizing the teenager''s lack of malice Captain Larkin demonstrates he too means no harm to the boy and successfully defuses the moment when he invites him to visit the cockpit later so he can show him "How this thing practically flies itself." which the boy cheerfully accepts. He then relays a message back to Davenport that he thinks this is a red herring and requests further detailed backgrounds on the passengers as he only has names and addresses to go on from the flight manifest.
Relationships develop on board between elderly singles Charlie Parkins and Ida Goldman, who acts as a comic relief with her Yiddish sense of humour, rock star Jack Marshall, and Marilyn Stonehurst, mystery writer Mona Briarly, and suave passenger Paul Barons. Briarly suspects Barons is actually a criminal who got away with stealing seven million dollars from a bank, but Barons denies it.
The investigations on the ground and in the air produce several leads. It is discovered that the wife of passenger Otto Gruenwaldt who died because fellow passenger Dr. Kenyon Walker was not available to help. Then Gruenwaldt suffers a heart attack on board. Dr. Walker rushes to aid the dying man. Captain Larkin voices his apprehension at allowing Dr. Walker to treat Gruenwaldt and Myerson concurs openly stating "it wouldn''t be the first time" implying someone in his position could take advantage of the situation to eliminate Gruenwaldt. Dr. Walker turns the tables on Larkin regarding whether he should apply the life saving drug or not, telling him "Alright you make the decision.". This puts the weight of life and death on Larkin''s shoulders for this patient. Larkin clearly realizes he now may be to blame for stopping Dr. Walker from administering a life-saving medical treatment. He reverses his decision and allows Dr. Walker to go ahead and inject the life saving drug. While doing so, Dr. Walker brazenly states to Larkin and Myerson that they wouldn''t even know if he gave Gruenwaldt "too much or too little" of the drug demonstrating to Larkin and Myerson how far they are beyond their depth of knowledge regarding medical expertise. 
Once the drug is administered via syringe Captain Larkin again attempts to assert his authority over Dr. Walker again by demanding he surrender the used syringe, implying it may be needed as evidence. Dr. Walker stands his ground and refuses to surrender the syringe in question and states that he is only answerable to "my peers and my profession" implying his Hippocratic Oath supersedes the Captain and Myerson''s legal authority. Larkin sharply replies that while Dr. Walker may be responsible for just this one life but as Captain of the airplane he is responsible for over 250 passenger''s lives. Dr. Walker again immediately cuts him short when he pointedly draws the line by stating to the Captain "we each have our jobs to do, you do yours and I''ll do mine". 
Finally someone ventures to ask how long before they know about Gruenwaldt''s survival, which he states will be in just few minutes and goes back to attending to Gruenwaldt who momentarily gains consciousness and begins to get upset that he has come to, realizing he might be expected to thank the same man responsible for his wife''s death. He perceives this as dereliction of duty because Dr. Walker failed to receive the call, being at a party, missing the delicate operation he could have provided. 
Dr. Walker cuts him short and explains that he doesn''t expect anything from Gruenwaldt but only asks he try to understand that life and death situations occur daily to the extent that he can''t remember them all. Gruentwaldt eventually gives grudging thanks for the saving of his life but makes it clear that he will still carry a hatred of his saviour for the loss of his wife, which Dr. Walker sagely replies "then that is something which we will both have to live with."
Ray Garwood attacks Marshall, blaming him for the death of his daughter due to an overdose. Garwood denies leaving the note, and Captain Larkin and Myerson believe him. Then an apparent break in the investigation comes when Briarly tells the captain that a priest on board may be an imposter, because he did nothing when it appeared Gruenwaldt was near death. Donaldson checks the priest out and discovers he is indeed an imposter and a known thief, thereby placing him under suspicion. Myerson looks for the priest, but finds him dead in the dumbwaiter. At this point the threatening letter''s contents are revealed to the passengers. Briarly again notices that Barons seems the most fazed by the priest''s death, and wonders if the two men knew each other. Soon a second murder occurs; flight attendant Vera Franklin is found dead by the co-pilot, meaning the real murderer is still lurking.
Concerned that he may be at risk now, Barons confesses to Myerson that he committed the bank robbery, and that the priest and Franklin were both involved in smuggling the money out of the country on the aircraft. Barons says he is the next target. Myerson agrees and pulls out a gun, proving he is the killer, having snapped when Barons escaped justice for his crime after no proof was found.
Myerson takes the passengers hostage and explains he murdered the priest and looked through the luggage of the crew and found the money in Franklin''s bag. Captain Larkin makes a drastic move to distract Myerson by releasing the oxygen masks and going for the gun. In the ensuing struggle, Barons is killed, the cabin catches on fire, and Myerson is badly burned. The passengers extinguish the fire just as the crisis ends. Coincidentally, Donaldson belatedly calls to warn Larkin about the danger of Myerson being reported by his superiors as unstable, much to the Captain''s irritation regarding the timeliness of the message. Larkin voices his frustration with Donaldson''s slow methods as the flight lands safely in London.
On the ground, flight attendant White is alone with Captain Larkin in the cockpit and comes to say a final good bye and expresses her gratitude for Larkin saving the passengers but in a turnabout Larkin reveals his realization that White has conspired as the money smuggler of the stolen money. He explains how before the aircraft took off Franklin had dropped her bag, which had no money inside. Therefore, the money was put in the bag by the real guilty smuggler, Karen White. Larkin, in an ironic statement, tells White that in fact this will definitely be her last flight but not because of her originally expected honorable resignation. She will have to soon face the authorities in London to face responsibility for her actions that lead to the death of the innocent flight attendant Vera Franklin.
Garwood still visibly frustrated about the circumstances of his daughter''s death apologizes to Marshall. Dr. Walker and Gruenwaldt reconcile and form a new relationship with a promise to meet in the future for a game of chess.  Charlie Perkins and Ida Goldman decide to share a hotel room. The elder man, Perkins, expresses his concerns of a potentially scandalous social appearance of the unmarried seniors sharing a room and how that will come across by asking "What will they think of us?" to which a typically unshakable Ida shrugs and responds "So they''ll call us swingers".
In the final scene, as Larkin accompanies Myerson down an escalator to hand him off to the waiting British police. Myerson demonstrates he is clearly delusional. He states that he and Larkin are in the "same business of protecting people". He further attempts to justify his actions, claiming he will be commended for protecting the people from criminals because he brought a thief to justice when the law would not. Mired in the delusional belief that he will be vindicated he shouts back to Larkin that he will put in a good word to the authorities for the Captain to get a commendation. Captain Larkin stoically looks on as Myerson is lead off by the uniformed London "Bobbies".','["George McCowan"]',NULL,'["Ralph Bellamy","Polly Bergen","Theodore Bikel"]','["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"]','5.3','["tt0057985","tt0070633","tt0070783","tt0099385","tt0034959","tt0071553","tt0030981","tt0076747","tt0037151","tt0067457","tt0070134","tt0078294"]','["Drama; Mystery; Thriller"]','[{"url":"/MurderOnFlight502.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/MurderOnFlight502_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/MurderOnFlight502_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','MurderOnFlight502',45038,'Q6938114','wp','["David P.

Hercules, played by Peter Lupus (credited as Rock Stevens),  is sent to free her.  The Babylonian slavers begin to hear rumors and stories of a single man who can overcome any army he faces.  Asparia conspires with another slave to send a message of her whereabouts to Hercules, who soon is heading towards Babylon.
The three siblings who rule Babylon—beautiful Taneal, warlike Salman Osar and more conservative Azzur—are visited by King Phaleg of Assyria.  Phaleg showers the three with gifts, offering up untold riches in exchange for all of the slaves in Babylon.  The siblings are suspicious of Phaleg''s motives, thinking he means to raise an army from the slaves.  Taneal seduces and drugs the Assyrian king, discovering that he intends to find Queen Asparia and marry her, creating a powerful empire of Assyria and Hellas.  The siblings agree to stop this, and send troops to ambush the king.  Hercules discovers the plan and aids the Assyrians, as the Babylonians are his enemy, and saves the life of the king. Phaleg makes Hercules take a loyalty oath, and then sends him to Babylon, along with several of his men, to retrieve Asparia.
In Babylon, each of the siblings is conspiring against the other; Salman Osar and Azzur both wish to marry Asparia and form an empire, while Taneal intends to steal the wealth of the city and then destroy it by the means of a giant subterranean wheel which supports the foundation of all Babylon.  Hercules is able to locate Asparia, and then begins to turn the giant wheel and destroy the city.  Salman Osar kills his brother, then is crushed by falling debris while attempting to kill his sister.  As Hercules'' Assyrian escorts attempt to steal Asparia away to Phaleg, Taneal takes the Queen hostage herself.  Phaleg and his large contingent of cavalry ride in to claim his new bride, but they are met by Hercules as well as the freed Babylonian slaves.  Phaleg is killed by Hercules, and his soldiers routed; Taneal seemingly poisons herself rather than face the judgement of Hercules and Asparia.

After finding a wallet and showing his honesty by returning it to Eddie Roman (Steve Cochran), a vicious gangster, he is hired by Roman to be his driver. Roman tests his new driver, whom he nicknames ''Scotty,'' by assuming control of his car from the back seat. Unbeknownst to Scotty, Roman has an accelerator installed in the rear passenger compartment so that he can "take over" the vehicle whenever he wants. This bizarre trick unnerves his new driver as well as Roman''s right-hand man, Gino (Peter Lorre).
Roman reveals himself as a tough gangster by killing any competition, and even locks his wife, Lorna (Michèle Morgan), in her room every night to control her.  Lorna goes for a drive every night at 9:30 pm, and one day she asks Scotty to take her to Havana, Cuba in exchange for $1,000. He consents and realizes that he is in love with her. When they get to Havana, they stop for a drink at a club, where Lorna is murdered with a knife while in Scotty''s arms. All the evidence, including the fact that Scotty apparently purchased the knife that was used to kill Lorna earlier that day, points to Scotty being the killer, and he realizes he is being framed. The photograph from the club that proves Scotty was innocent is destroyed by Gino, who has come down to Cuba to exact revenge against Lorna and Scotty. Scotty escapes police custody, but is gunned down by Gino when he returns to the curio store where the knife came from. 
Suddenly, Scotty wakes up back in Miami on the night he and Lorna are supposed to abscond to Havana. He is sweating profusely and immediately takes his pills that he is prescribed, presumably to deal with posttraumatic stress disorder from battle. Scotty remembers nothing, and goes to the naval hospital to seek treatment from his doctor, Commander Davidson (Jack Holt). Davidson urges him to try to remember details of why he was dressed as a driver, but Scotty is unable. The two go drinking at the Florida Club.
Meanwhile, Lorna is shocked that Scotty abruptly quit his job and left earlier that night, and she is locked in her room after Roman discovers her writing a love letter to Scotty. Roman and Gino go to the Florida Club to cool down, unknowingly sitting across the club, and behind a partition, from the missing Scotty. Davidson, who presumably had been treating Roman, realizes that the woman Scotty is in love with is actually Roman''s wife, but by this time, Scotty remembers where he was supposed to be and leaves to find Lorna. He rescues her and the two head for the port, but Gino and Roman are also heading to the port once they find out that Scotty was seen at the port buying tickets earlier that morning. Because Roman uses his master accelerator to push the car up to speeds of 100 mph, it crashes with an oncoming train, killing both gangsters. Scotty and Lorna are now free to sail to Cuba and be together.','["Arthur Ripley"]','["Philip Yordan","Cornell Woolrich"]','["Robert Cummings","Michèle Morgan","Steve Cochran"]','["Crime","Film-Noir","Thriller"]','6.6','["tt0038360","tt0039583","tt0047370","tt0042707","tt0038462","tt0038123","tt0039029","tt0042007","tt0033802","tt0047263","tt0041368","tt0038965"]','["Film-Noir; Peter Lorre"]','[{"url":"/TheChase.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/TheChase_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/TheChase__archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','TheChase_',166521,'Q3205604','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Because a stray cat and dog make noises at inopportune times while Larry prepares the meal, Larry''s meal appears to be actual dog and cat meat, which brings Moe and Shemp great grief when ordered to eat it by their customers.
These two customers are thieves intent on robbing the tomb of King Rootintootin, which contains a priceless diamond.

Before ben Sober and Rumma can reveal their scheme, they discover that the Emir of Shmow (Johnny Kascier) has already gotten his hands on the diamond.

('tt0139491','free','The Negro Soldier (1944)','1944','43min','During World War II, Nazi Germany threatened to take over Europe, North Africa and the Near East. The United States Army was looking for men to enlist. Although the U.S. army was officially committed to practicing segregation, they looked to African Americans to add manpower to the group. Social scientists of the time argued that the mass media were the best method of instilling a message within people and pushing them to act towards a common goal.The army selected Frank Capra to head the effort to create morale films that were designed to build enthusiasm for war purposes. Capra was an immigrant from Sicily, who began his career in Hollywood working on humorous short films. However, he went on to create many well-known films that made it big in the box office. In March 1942, Capra began brainstorming The Negro Soldier. He asked different researchers to inform him about what was okay and not okay when it came to creating a cinematic depiction of African Americans. These researchers came up with a list of cautions, some of which included “avoid stereotypes such as the Negroes’ alleged affinity for watermelon or pork; also avoid strong images of racial identity (‘play down colored soldiers more Negroid in appearance’ and omit ‘Lincoln, emancipation, or any race leaders or friends of the Negro’)”. With these cautions in mind, the writer Marc Connelly created the first script for The Negro Soldier, with the same sympathetic treatment for Negro themes that he had used in his earlier work, The Green Pastures. Connelly’s first script ended up being too dramatic for the Army’s tastes. In response, Ben Hecht and Jo Swerling prepared a second draft of the movie; however, it too was rejected because the Army insisted the movie be more of a documentary. Ultimately, Carlton Moss was hired to write the movie and Stuart Heisler became director. Moss attended Columbia University and worked for the Federal Theater Project. Both Moss and Heisler worked very well together.The film began shooting in 1943. The movie crew traveled the United States, visiting over 19 different army posts. The final movie totaled 43 minutes long and received official support in 1944. At first, The Negro Soldier was intended for only African American troops; however, the creators of the film decided that they wanted to distribute the film to a wider military and civil audience. Nobody was certain what the impact of the film would have on viewers, and many people feared that African Americans would have a negative response to the film. However, when the first African American troops saw the film, they insisted that all African American troops should see it. Furthermore, after both African Americans and whites were surveyed about their response to the film, the filmmakers were shocked when over 80% of the white population thought the film should be shown to both black and white troops, as well as white civilians.Eventually, replacement centers all over the United States required their troops to watch The Negro Soldier. Almost all black Army members and Air Corps members saw the film, and many white soldiers watched the film during orientation programs. Although the film had been made solely for a military audience, Capra and the rest of the film crew wanted to distribute the film commercially all over the United States as well. Many people gave the film great reviews and praised the film very highly; however, the film did not do well commercially as shown in theatres. The 43-minute length of the film made it awkward to show alongside typical films of the time that were longer than one hour. All the while, a filmmaker named Jack Goldberg was suing Capra and The Negro Soldier because he believed that the film “competed unfairly” with his own film that dealt with the same race issues. Although Goldberg ended up losing this lawsuit, The Negro Soldier was never successful in theaters.','["Stuart Heisler"]',NULL,'["Gertrude Elise Ayer","Richmond Barthé","Erich Borchmeyer"]','["Documentary","Drama","War"]','5.9','["tt0037404","tt0036152","tt0036629","tt0036630","tt0035209","tt0034498","tt0038171","tt0036301","tt0038687","tt0185405","tt0028219","tt0056053"]','["World War II;African Americans;war"]','[{"url":"/negrosoldier.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/negrosoldier_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/negrosoldier_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','negrosoldier',22899,'Q2037430','wp','["Carlton Moss"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

In Chimayo, children Andrea and Glen Anderson observe strange ripples in the lake. Glen claims they belong to an animal he has been sighting in the lake for some time. Their father Pete (Anthony Eisley), administrator of the Durado plant, is introduced to Mayor Montero and his daughter, helicopter pilot Juanita. Sánchez meets up with Carlos in a church, and together they plot to drive out the Americans and the monster he thinks was created by the pollution of the lake. When María goes to visit José''s grave, Carlos''s men attack her.
Juanita picks up Travis at the airport. When he gets to Chimayo, he is accosted by Clark, and curtly refuses any interviews. Meanwhile, Pete is trying to break up with his secretary Laura to pursue a new affair with Juanita, but can''t bring himself to do it. He visits her again that night when she is skinny dipping in the lake, and successfully breaks up, but the monster emerges from the lake and kills Laura after he leaves. The town is busy celebrating its 200th anniversary and the body goes undiscovered until the next morning.
Travis and the plant doctor investigate the killing and link it to José''s death. Glen tells Travis about the animal he saw, convincing Travis that there is something in the lake. Soon afterwards, Sánchez meets Travis and threatens violence against Durado. Travis and Montero confront Clark about her reporting, and they negotiate exclusive rights to the pollution story in exchange for her temporary silence. Travis also calls his boss Barnes (Philip Carey) to request sonar equipment with which to track the monster. Determined to prove the monster''s existence, Glen decides to stake out the lake at night. He drags Andrea along, and they manage to take some photos of the monster before it attacks some drunken fishermen.
They present their evidence to Travis while the village continues celebrating their anniversary. Simultaneously, Sánchez sets some plastic explosives to blow up the plant. However, he gets trapped after lighting the fuse. Meanwhile, a party of men chases María, whom they blame for all their troubles. The town priest (John Carradine) claims that he can exorcise her, but the men are unconvinced and burn her at the stake. Sánchez''s bomb goes off, and the next day Travis reveals that the plant has been badly damaged and María severely burned. Consequently, she is airlifted to a Panamanian hospital in Chimayo''s only helicopter to get treatment.
Travis comes up with a plan to kill the beast: he stuffs some explosives into a goat carcass, which he will hang by the detonator cord from a helicopter. In order to obtain a new chopper, Juanita lures some rescue workers with a fake mayday and hijacks their craft at gunpoint. They get to the lake and the Nessie-like monster takes the bait, but Travis loses the detonator and dives in after it. A local policeman distracts the monster by circling it with his boat, and thus buys Travis enough time to retrieve the detonator and blow the creature to pieces.
However, some time later the Andersons are down by the lake again, and their German Shepherd finds a large egg. A reptilian creature hatches out of it, and the film ends as the camera pans over a clutch of dozens of similar eggs.',NULL,'["Kenneth Hartford","Kenneth Hartford"]','["James Mitchum","John Carradine","Philip Carey"]','["Horror","Sci-Fi"]','2.7','["tt0104083","tt0080506","tt0074365","tt0062036","tt0070908","tt0072147","tt0069047","tt0051993","tt0080990","tt0089845","tt0070039","tt0064888"]','["monster;monstroid;elvira;moive;scifi;sci-fi;sci;fi;horror"]','[{"url":"/MonsterA.k.a.Monstroid_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/MonstroidVhsRip_xvid.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/MonstroidVhsRip_xvid_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/MonstroiditCameFromTheLake.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/MonstroiditCameFromTheLake_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','MonsterA.k.a.Monstroid',15687,'Q6902654','wp',NULL,'["Kenneth Hartford","Herbert L.

When Quirt urgently insists upon sending a telegram, Thomas and his daughter Penelope (Gail Russell) drive him into town in their wagon. After wiring a claim to the land recorder''s office, Quirt passes out and Penny cradles him. Ignoring the doctor''s advice to rid themselves of the gunman, the compassionate Worth family tends to the delirious Quirt, and Penny becomes intrigued by his ravings of past loves.
Days later, when Quirt regains consciousness, Penny patiently explains the family''s belief in non-violence. Three weeks later, Laredo Stevens (Bruce Cabot) and Hondo Jeffries (Louis Faust) ride into town looking for Quirt. When Penny''s younger brother Johnny (Stephen Grant) rushes home to inform Quirt of his visitors, Quirt quickly prepares to flee. Penny, now smitten with Quirt, offers to run off with him. At the sound of approaching horses, Quirt grabs his gun and discovers that it has been emptied. Training his gun on the doorway, Quirt calmly greets Hondo and Laredo. Thinking that Quirt has the upper hand, Laredo offers to buy his claim. When Quirt sets the price at $20,000, Laredo hands over $5,000 in gold and challenges him to come for the balance when he is able – if he has the nerve.

Afterward, Quirt saddles his horse, but when Penny begs him to stay, he changes his mind. Later, Quirt learns that cantankerous rancher Frederick Carson (Paul Hurst) has dammed up the stream that runs through the valley, thus draining the Worths'' irrigation ditches. Quirt intimidates Carson into opening the dam.
One Sunday, Penny asks Quirt to join the family for a ride. Before they leave, Marshal Wistful McClintock (Harry Carey) comes to question Quirt about a stagecoach robbery. The family swears that Quirt was with them at the time. The marshal then asks Quirt why he resigned as Wyatt Earp''s deputy, sold his ranch and crossed over to the wrong side of the law soon after cattleman Walt Ennis was gunned down in a saloon brawl. When Quirt refuses to answer, the marshal leaves. Penny then begs Quirt to steer clear of Laredo, and he acquiesces because of his love for her.
As Quirt and the Worths ride to the Quaker gathering, Quirt''s erstwhile sidekick, Randy McCall (Lee Dixon), tags along. Randy tells Quirt that Laredo plans to rustle a herd of cattle and suggests that they then steal the herd from Laredo and let him take the blame. Mr. Worth gives Quirt a Bible for ending the feud with Carson. Fearing that he will never be able to live up to Penny''s expectations, Quirt abruptly leaves with Randy.

Quirt and Randy steal the herd from the original rustlers. They then celebrate with showgirls Lila Neal (Joan Barton) and Christine Taylor (Rosemary Bertrand). When Lila, sensing a change in her old flame, teases Quirt about his Bible, Quirt becomes angry and rides back to the Worth farm. Overjoyed, Penny throws her arms around him, just as the marshal arrives to question Quirt about the rustling. Quirt states that Lila can provide him with an alibi. Penny is hurt that Quirt was with his old flame, who she heard him talk about in his delirium, thinking Quirt prefers Lila''s fair hair.  Quirt realizes the depth of his feelings for Penny, and they kiss hungrily in the barn, while the camera fades.
The marshal warns Quirt that he is the wrong man for Penny. Quirt decides to propose to her anyway. Instead of replying, Penny invites Quirt to join her picking blackberries. Quirt answers Penny''s questions about his early life. Kindly Walt Ennis raised him after his parents were massacred by Indians. Then Ennis was murdered.
Quirt and Penny are ambushed and chased by Laredo and Hondo on their way home. Their  wagon plunges over a cliff into the river, causing Penny to develop a dangerous fever. When the doctor informs Quirt that there is no hope for her, Quirt straps on his pistol and rides into town to exact revenge. After Quirt leaves, Penny''s fever suddenly breaks.
In town, Quirt sends Bradley to tell Laredo and Hondo he is waiting for them in the street. Penny and her family arrive. She gets Quirt to surrender his gun to her. As Laredo and Hondo draw their guns, Marshal McClintock shoots them both. Quirt rides off in the wagon with Penny. The marshal picks up Quirt''s discarded weapon. Bradley comments that Quirt may need the weapon, to which the marshal says, "Only a man who carries a gun ever needs one."

While in the cemetery, Barbra is attacked by a strange man. Johnny tries to rescue his sister, but the assailant strikes Johnny''s head against a gravestone, killing him. After wrecking their car in a panic, Barbra escapes on foot, with the stranger in pursuit. She arrives at a farmhouse, where she discovers a woman''s mangled corpse. Fleeing from the house, she is confronted by strange, menacing ghouls, including the man in the graveyard. A man named Ben arrives and takes her back to the house, driving the monsters away and barricading the doors and windows. While doing this, Ben finds a radio and a lever-action rifle. Throughout the night, Barbra slowly descends into a stupor of shock and insanity.
Ben discovers that the farmhouse has a cellar. The cellar houses an angry married couple, Harry and Helen Cooper, along with their daughter Karen. The Coopers sought refuge after a group of the same monsters overturned their car. Tom and Judy, a teenage couple, arrived after hearing an emergency broadcast about a series of brutal killings. Karen has fallen seriously ill after being bitten by one of the monsters. They venture upstairs when Ben turns the radio on, while Barbra awakens from her stupor. Harry demands that everyone hide in the cellar, but Ben deems it a "deathtrap" and continues to barricade the house upstairs with Tom''s help. Radio reports explain that a wave of mass murder is sweeping across the East Coast of the United States. Ben finds a television, and he and other occupants of the house watch an emergency broadcaster report that the recently deceased have become reanimated and are consuming the flesh of the living. Experts, scientists, and the military have failed to determine the cause of the reanimations, though one scientist suspects that they are due to radioactive contamination from a space probe that was blown up in Earth''s atmosphere while returning from Venus.

Ben plans to obtain medical care for Karen when the reports list local rescue centers offering refuge and safety. Ben and Tom attempt to refuel Ben''s truck at the nearby gas pump while Harry hurls Molotov cocktails from an upper window at the ghouls. Judy follows him, fearing for Tom''s safety. Tom accidentally spills gasoline on the truck, which is set ablaze by Ben''s torch. Tom and Judy try to drive the truck away from the pump, but Judy is unable to free herself from its door. The truck explodes, killing them both, and the ghouls promptly eat the charred remains. Ben returns to the house but is locked out by Harry. Eventually forcing his way back in, Ben beats Harry, angered by his cowardice. A news report reveals that a gunshot or heavy blow to the head, as well as setting them on fire, can stop the ghouls. It also reports that posses of armed men are patrolling the countryside to restore order.
The power goes out, and the ghouls break through the barricades. Harry grabs Ben''s rifle and threatens to shoot him. In the chaos, the two fight. Ben wrestles the gun from Harry and shoots him. Harry stumbles into the cellar and, mortally wounded, collapses next to Karen, who has died from her illness. The ghouls try to pull Helen and Barbra through the windows, but Helen frees herself while Barbra holds them at bay. Helen returns to the cellar to see Karen reanimated and eating Harry''s corpse. Karen then stabs the terrified Helen to death with a masonry trowel. Barbra, seeing Johnny among the ghouls, is carried away by the horde and devoured. As the ghouls overrun the house, Ben fights off Karen, seals himself inside the cellar — the very course of action he had refused to do earlier — and shoots Harry and Helen''s corpses as they begin to reanimate.
The next morning, Ben is awakened by the posse''s gunfire outside. Upon venturing upstairs, he is immediately mistaken for one of the ghouls and killed with a shot to the forehead. His body is thrown onto a pile of corpses, which is then set ablaze.','["George A. Romero"]','["John A. Russo","George A.

('tt0055019','free','The Intruder (1962)','1962','1h 24min','In the early 1960s, Adam Cramer arrives in the small Southern town of Caxton with an agenda that soon becomes clear. Caxton''s "whites only" high school is about to undergo forced desegregation and admit black students due to a court order, and Cramer, purportedly working on behalf of an organization called The Patrick Henry Society, is a racist working to incite the white townspeople to strongly and possibly violently resist the desegregation. Although Cramer is not from the area or even from the South (shown by his lack of a Southern accent), he quickly charms most of the people he meets, presenting himself as a confident, smooth-talking, well-mannered gentleman. He quickly convinces wealthy landowner Verne Shipman to back him, and seduces Ella, the pretty teenage daughter of the local newspaper editor Tom McDaniel.
The white locals are not happy about having black students attend the "white school", but prior to Cramer''s arrival, most were prepared to grudgingly comply with the law. However, after Cramer, with Shipman''s help, makes an inflammatory speech in front of the town hall and organizes a cross burning in the black neighborhood, the whites are moved to violence, first threatening a black family who happen to be driving through town after Cramer''s speech, and then blowing up the local black church, killing the preacher. After the church bombing, Cramer is jailed, but the locals join together to get him quickly released.
Apart from his racist rabblerousing, Cramer also seduces Vi, the emotionally unstable wife of traveling salesman Sam Griffin, Cramer''s next door neighbor at the Caxton hotel. Vi, ashamed of her lapse, leaves Griffin, who figures out what happened and comes after Cramer with Cramer''s own gun. The terrified Cramer''s confident facade crumbles for the first time; when he manages to get the gun and point it back at Griffin, he is too weak to pull the trigger, and Griffin reveals that he already removed the bullets from the gun before the confrontation. Griffin predicts that Cramer will soon lose control of the racially charged tensions that he has ignited in the town.
McDaniel, after seeing Cramer in action, realizes that his own sympathies are with the blacks and feels compelled to stand with them against the racists. After the preacher is killed, the families of the black students hesitate to send their children back to the white high school for fear of more violence, but McDaniel encourages them, and walks the students to school himself through the town past the disapproving glares of other white townspeople. After the students enter the school, several townspeople confront and severely beat McDaniel, causing him to be hospitalized with broken ribs, internal injuries and the loss of his eye. Cramer secretly meets with Ella, who is upset and worried about her father, and convinces her that the townspeople are planning to kill her father and that the only way to save him is for Ella to do what Cramer says.
Ella, following Cramer''s directions, lures her black classmate Joey Green to a storage room on the pretext of helping her get some heavy boxes from a high shelf. She then screams and falsely accuses him of attempting to rape her. Joey denies it, and the principal believes him, but also knows that most people will believe Ella. An angry mob led by Cramer and Shipman forms in front of the school. Joey, rather than escape out the back door with the principal and attempt to reach the safety of the sheriff''s office, insists on going out to confront the mob. Shipman beats Joey and the mob begins to lynch him on the school playground swing set. Suddenly Griffin appears with Ella, who confesses that she lied at Cramer''s instigation in order to save her father''s life. In front of the mob, Ella apologizes to Joey, telling him that Cramer said he would not be harmed and would only be expelled from the white school. Realizing that they have been manipulated by Cramer, the townspeople slowly walk away, ignoring Cramer''s exhortations, until only he and Griffin are left on the empty playground. Griffin tells Cramer that his "work" in Caxton is finished and that he should catch the next bus out of town.','["Roger Corman"]','["Charles Beaumont","Charles Beaumont"]','["William Shatner","Frank Maxwell","Beverly Lunsford"]','["Drama"]','7.6','["tt0056368","tt0058333","tt0051887","tt0088963","tt0085289","tt0050778","tt0031158","tt0034893","tt0260495","tt0072403","tt0053610","tt0011387"]','["Drama; William Shatner"]','[{"url":"/Shame.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Shame_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/shame__archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','shame_',336522,'Q2018199','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

He meets his second cousin, once removed, Albert Marbury (William Eythe), a reporter for the Leader newspaper.  
The next day, Confederate Memorial Day, Mayor Bill Silk (Thurston Hall) announces he intends to rename the town Confederate Monument Square after an undistinguished deceased politician named Pud Toolen. Effingham persuades a reluctant Earl Hoats (Allyn Joslyn), the editor of the Leader, to let him write a war column (for free). Effingham soon attacks the mayor''s plan in his column, much to Hoats'' dismay. The rival News is getting most of the advertising revenue due to its friendly attitude toward the complacent local government, and Hoats had been trying to combat that.
Silk decides to use Effingham, agreeing to the latter''s beautification scheme for the square, but also deciding to tear down the old courthouse (and giving his brother-in-law Bill the contract to erect the new one). When Effingham learns about the plan, he fights for the courthouse’s restoration. He brings in expert Major Hickock to evaluate the condition of the building.
The mayor responds by calling a town meeting, hoping that no one will show up. But Effingham alerts residents about the meeting in his column, and lots of townsfolk attend. The mayor claims the town will get 1/3 of the cost paid for by the Works Progress Administration if a new courthouse is built, but nothing for repairs. When uncomfortable questions are still asked, the mayor hastily adjourns the meeting. Effingham checks out the claims, and finds out that none of what the mayor said is true. Silk, however, refuses to call a second meeting. 
Despite the lack of support from the newspaper''s staff, with the sole exception of Ella Sue Dozier, Effingham is undeterred. He talks to the key townspeople, but they refuse to help him, and his spirit is finally broken.
Cousin Albert, who has enlisted in the National Guard (in an effort to impress Ella Sue), realizes that Effingham is right. When the local Guard unit is called up by the federal government, the mayor starts to make an empty speech, but the crowd is hostile. Albert lashes out, demanding that the courthouse be repaired and the square left alone. With the townsfolk solidly behind him, he forces the mayor to give in to his demands, and Effingham''s old friends admit he was right after all.','["Irving Pichel"]','["Kathryn Scola","Berry Fleming"]','["Charles Coburn","Joan Bennett","William Eythe"]','["Comedy"]','6.0','["tt0024958","tt0056818","tt0054628","tt0032284","tt0055779","tt0039806","tt0069496","tt0026180","tt0067486","tt0061380","tt0024262","tt0023537"]','["Comedy; Drama"]','[{"url":"/colonel_effinghams_raid.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/colonel_effinghams_raid_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/colonel_effinghams_raid_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/video.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/video_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','colonel_effinghams_raid',32968,'Q5148121','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

A belligerent Foxy serves as his gunner and is not accepted as a team player by the other members of the aircrew.

('tt0006206','free','Les vampires (1915)','1915','7h 1min','Lensed in an eerily abandoned Paris in 1915, Louis Feuillade''s stark chapterplay LES VAMPIRES is a grim and powerful work which is worlds apart from the later glitz and polish of the golden age serials produced by the American studios.

It should be noted that serials were nothing new at this point in time. Formative efforts such as THE PERILS OF PAULINE had already established the appeal of these generally inexpensive actioners, with their bizarre twists and inventive death traps.

The emphasis was generally on a resourceful protagonist pitted against an equally inventive and determined fiend -- frequently an unsuspected heir or lawyer out to obtain an undeserved inheritance.

LES VAMPIRES did this formula one better, making the menace a vast and largely unsuspected criminal empire which is devouring Paris from inside. With members taken from all classes, the dark society is able to plunder, blackmail and murder without dear of action from the authorities. This continues until their removal of a government investigator brings ambitious reporter Philippe Guerande (Edouard Mathe) into things.

Sent to the country to search for details on the official''s murder, Philippe plans to combine business and pleasure by meeting Dr. Lox, an old family friend who has a chateau in the area.

Arriving at Lox''s estate at the same time as an American heiress who means to purchase the property, the reporter is promptly framed for theft by the hooded agents of the gang, who are secreted in the ancient building.

Locating the dead investigator''s head, Philippe manages to turn suspicion on Lox. Murdering the heiress and making his escape across the rooftops, the "doctor" is revealed as the Grand Vampire the (evident) leader of the criminal society.

Philippe falls into the Vampires'' hands but is rescued by Oscar Cloud Mazamette (Marcel Levesque) -- a clerk and minor member of the gang whom he had helped earlier. Philippe and Mazamette combine to try to expose the society''s operations and bring the gang to a deserved end.

A series of adventures follow, with the Grand Vampire (Fernand Herrmann) and exotic dancer/criminal Irma Vep (Musidora) providing much of the opposition. In a surprise development, it is revealed that the Grand Vampire is not the gang''s ultimate leader. When it is convenient, his superior eliminates him. He, in turn, commits suicide when he is imprisoned by the police.

Satanas, the criminal mastermind behind the group''s poisons and explosives steps in and assumes co-command with Irma Vep. This occurs too late, however, as Philippe is closing in on the gang''s chief meeting place.

After a series of close calls, the reporter and the reformed Mazamette succeed in destroying the Vampires'' leadership and bringing the rank and file members to justice.

Not enough emphasis can be placed on the serial''s grim and stark look, which almost functions as a characters of its own. This is a Paris where the gang''s activities have seemingly terrified the people to the degree that they refuse to venture out unless it is absolutely unavoidable.

Production took place during WW I, when the streets were largely abandoned, and this strange desolation combines with the scurrying of the few characters to present a powerful emphasis that goes beyond the actual turns and twists of the plotline. The result is compelling, entertaining, and more than a bit weird in spots. Tinted scenes add to the welcome air of unreality.','["Louis Feuillade"]',NULL,'["Musidora","Édouard Mathé","Marcel Lévesque"]','[""]','7.3','["tt0006886","tt2122391","tt0002844","tt0006864","tt0009968","tt0012532","tt2122386","tt0011870","tt0014417","tt2122387","tt0003930","tt0003952"]','["dwid hellion; Les Vampires; Louis Feuillade; horror; silent film; edward gorey; paris cinema"]','[{"url":"/LesVampires1915DirectedByLouisFeuillade_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/lesvamps_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','LesVampires1915DirectedByLouisFeuillade',59512,'Q602998','ao','["Louis Feuillade"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Against her brother''s wishes, she is planning a month-long trip into the desert, escorted only by natives.
When Diana goes to the local casino, she is informed it has been appropriated for the evening by an important sheik, and that none but Arabs may enter. Annoyed at being told what she cannot do, and her curiosity piqued, Diana borrows an Arab dancer''s costume and sneaks in. Inside, she finds men gambling for new wives. When she is selected to be the next prize, she resists. Sheik Ahmed Ben Hassan (Rudolph Valentino) intervenes, then realizes she is white. Amused, he sends her away. Afterward, Mustapha Ali (Charles Brinley) informs the Sheik she is the woman he has been hired to guide tomorrow. The Sheik hatches a plan. Early the next morning, he sneaks into her room and tampers with the bullets in her revolver as she is sleeping.
As her brother leaves her to her desert excursion, she assures him he will see her in London next month. The Sheik and his men come upon Diana riding alone. She tries to flee while shooting at the Sheik, but he easily captures her. Back at his encampment, he orders her about. She is unused to such treatment, but the Sheik tells her she will learn and demands she dress like a woman (she is wearing pants) for dinner.
Diana tries again to escape, this time into a raging sand storm. The Sheik saves her from certain death, and tells her she will learn to love him. Later, he finds Diana alone in her quarters weeping. The Sheik considers forcing himself upon her, but decides against it and calls for a serving girl, Zilah (Ruth Miller). Zilah offers her a hug. Diana accepts, and pours out her tears in Zilah''s arms.
After a week, the Sheik is delighted by the news that his close friend from his days in Paris, where he was educated, is coming for a visit. Diana is dismayed at the thought of being seen in Arab dress by a Westerner, but the Sheik does not understand her shame. He does, however, return her gowns before his friend comes so she can wear them to dinner.  When she is introduced to writer and doctor Raoul St. Hubert (Adolphe Menjou), Diana''s spirit is nearly broken. He befriends her and reprimands the Sheik for his callous treatment of her. The Sheik returns her Western clothing, though he refuses to release her.
When Raoul is called away to tend to an injured man, Diana shows concern that it might be the Sheik. Seeing this from hiding, the Sheik is elated that she may be warming up to him at last. He gives Diana her gun back, telling her he trusts her.
Diana is allowed to go into the desert under the watchful eye of the Sheik''s French valet Gaston (Lucien Littlefield). She escapes. Making her way across the sands, she spots a caravan, unaware that it belongs to the bandit Omair (Walter Long). The Sheik and his men reach her first.
The Sheik reveals to Raoul he is in love with Diana; his friend convinces him to let her go. Meanwhile, Diana is allowed out once more. She playfully writes "I love you Ahmed" in the sand. Then Omair''s band captures her, killing her guards and leaving the wounded Gaston for dead.
When the Sheik goes looking for Diana, he sees her message, then learns from Gaston who has abducted her. He gathers his men to attack Omair''s stronghold. Omair tries to force himself on Diana, but is almost stabbed by one of his women. Then the Sheik and his men sweep in. After a long fight, the Sheik kills Omair, but is himself gravely injured.
Raoul tends to him and tells Diana he has a chance. She sits and holds the Sheik''s hand. When she remarks that his hand is big for an Arab, Raoul reveals that the Sheik is not one. His father was British and his mother Spanish. They died in the desert, and their child was rescued and raised by the old Sheik; when the old man died, Ahmed returned to rule the tribe. When Ahmed wakes up, Diana confesses her love.','["George Melford"]','["Edith Maude Hull","Monte M.

('tt1128215','free','Know Your Ally: Britain (1944)','1944','42min','The film opens with a shot of a football team making a touchdown and the crowd cheering. The narration begins, informing us that that victory was won by a team where everyone knew the job they had to do: "We''re playing another kind of a game now, only this one isn''t for fun. It''s for keeps." the narrator declares, with shots of a tank battle now on screen. British life and society are briefly introduced. The narrator notes especially the high population density of Britain and the solidarity that this inspires between various elements of its society.

Here''s where he lives – a little island no larger than the state of Idaho.  Half a million people live in Idaho.  96 times that number live in Britain.  The Nazis and the Japs scream about Lebensraum – "living space" – but on a square mile of Britain there are more people than on a square mile of Germany or Italy or Japan.In 1938, the year the Yankees won the pennant, the British were going about their daily lives, working and cheering football on their day off. 300 miles (480 km) away, however, others were cheering for Hitler. The Brits try to reason with him through the Munich Agreement, but he breaks his word, invading Czechoslovakia and Poland. Now "John Britain," as he is personified, is at war, and pretty soon he is at war alone, since western Europe soon falls to the Nazis. For one solid year, from June 1940 to June 1941, he is alone.
Various differences in British and American culture are addressed, sometimes humorously, other more soberly, such as the position of the monarchy and the peers in British society. "Britain is like your Grandma''s house; she''s been around a long time and keeps a lot of old things she doesn''t wish to part with." However, the British and Americans also have many things in common, more important things, such as a free representative government (where Americans call it Congress, the British call it Parliament), freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of religion. The film also mentions how, centuries ago, the British fought for the Magna Carta, and how the Americans adopted these principles and made it their own in the U.S. Constitution. In conclusion, America and Britain are more similar than the Nazis want to believe.
Next, the film delves into the British Empire, a trickier subject. First, it argues that the Nazis insisted that Britain only declared war on Germany to save the British Empire. The Nazis expected the British time and again to negotiate a peace offer with them. But the British had no intention of doing so; they intended to, in Winston Churchill''s words, teach the Nazis "a lesson which they – and the world – will never forget." The narrator then delves into the Empire itself: first, the home-rule of Canada, South Africa, and the other white dominions, and then giving a rosy picture of how much self-government India has, and how, because of its strategic significance – "an effective block by the democratic world to keep the Nazis and Japs from uniting" and "the bases for United Nations bombers to get at the Japs in Burma" – it cannot be independent just yet, but the British would allow it to be so after the war was over, provided they could work out a constitution of their own. In the Mediterranean and North Africa, meanwhile, the British Empire made the American landings in North Africa possible.
The film also dispels the Nazi myth that the British are passively letting others fight the war for them ("Britain will fight to the last Australian, Canadian or New Zealander."). Contrary to Nazi belief, one inhabitant of the British Empire out of ten comes from Britain, while seven casualties out of ten are from Britain. In the Royal Air Force, two planes out of every three are operated by the British, who also operate four planes out of every five on the overseas fronts. Likewise, the Royal Navy, too, is also crewed almost entirely by the British. The British Merchant Navy is shown as particularly resilient, regardless of Nazi attacks.','["Anthony Veiller"]',NULL,'["Lord Beaverbrook","Ernest Bevin","Winston Churchill"]','[""]','6.1','["tt0033532","tt0034694","tt0031572","tt0145781","tt0040897"]','["FedFlix; ntis.gov"]','[{"url":"/ava06858vnb1_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/gov.ntis.ava06858vnb1_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','gov.ntis.ava06858vnb1',82783,'Q6423170','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

It is a rousing success, but one night during the show orders are received to leave immediately for France: instead of the finale, the troops march up the aisles through the audience, out the theater''s main entrance and into a convoy of waiting trucks. Among the teary, last-minute goodbyes Jones kisses his newlywed bride Ethel (Rosemary DeCamp) farewell.
In the trenches of France, several of the soldiers in the production are killed or wounded by shrapnel from a German artillery barrage. Jones is wounded in the leg and must walk with a cane, ending his career as a dancer. Nevertheless, he is resolved to find something useful to do, especially now that he is the father of a son. Sgt. McGee (Alan Hale Sr.) and Pvt. Eddie Dibble (Charles Butterworth), the troop bugler, also survive.
Twenty-five years later World War II is raging in Europe. Jerry''s son Johnny (Ronald Reagan) enlists in the Army shortly after Pearl Harbor. He tells his sweetheart Eileen Dibble (Joan Leslie) that they cannot marry until he returns, since he doesn''t want to make her a widow.
Johnny reluctantly accepts an order to stage another musical, following in his father''s footsteps. The show goes on tour throughout the United States and eventually plays Washington, D.C., in front of President Roosevelt (Jack Young). During the show it is announced that this is the last performance: the soldiers in the production have been ordered back to their combat units.
Eileen, who has joined the Red Cross auxiliary, appears backstage. During a break in the show she brings a minister and convinces Johnny that they should marry now - which they do, in the alley behind the theater, with their fathers acting as witnesses.

When a ship makes its monthly visit, Ted has to outrun a mob of creditors to obtain his remittance cheque from the Controleur, the colonial governor. However, his friend makes him pay his debts, leaving him only a little.
Ginger then gets Lia to sneak out of the classroom of Martha Jones. The homesick man tells Lia of England. Martha has him arrested. He is sentenced to three months on the road gang, but that does not satisfy the puritanical pair of Martha Jones and her missionary brother. They want him deported, but Ginger is the Controleur''s only real local friend, so he sends him to alcohol-free Agor Island to try to reform him.
When Martha insists on going to another island to attend to a medical emergency, the Controleur sends his sergeant along as escort, with secret orders to pick up Ginger on the way back. When their boat''s propeller strikes a reef, they have to spend the night on the nearest island while repairs are made. Martha finds it rather traumatic at first, but then unexpectedly begins to warm to Ginger. After Dr. Jones later thanks Ginger for not taking advantage of his sister, Ginger knocks the Controleur out when the latter laughs at him.
While Ginger is passed out drunk on the beach, Martha cleans his shack. When Ginger returns, he demands she leave.
Then typhoid breaks out on one of the other islands. the Controleur asks Ginger to accompany Dr. Jones to help inoculate the natives; Ginger refuses at first, then reluctantly agrees. However, when Jones is overcome by a flareup of malaria, Martha insists on taking his place. Ginger backs out, but changes his mind after she starts crying.
When they reach the village, they discover that the residents believe the disease is the result of abandoning their old religion. Albert, the headman and a former Christian convert, warns them to leave. Martha insists on confronting the natives, but Ginger drags her away before anything happens.
That night, the headman''s wife brings her sick child to the pair. Martha inoculates her. When the headman demands his child back, Ginger sends him away. Ominous drumming starts. Facing imminent attack, Ginger tells Martha about how he wanted to marry a barmaid and run a pub, though he was the son of the local vicar; in turn, she tells him her father drank himself to death. Then the child recovers, and the danger is over.
The pair marry and return to England to manage a pub, though Ginger gives up drinking entirely.','["Erich Pommer"]','["W.

('tt0043390','free','Cause for Alarm! (1951)','1951','1h 14min','A flashback shows how Ellen (Loretta Young) met George (Barry Sullivan) in a naval hospital during World War II  while she was dating his friend, Lieutenant Ranney Grahame (Bruce Cowling), a young military doctor whose busy schedule left little time for her. George was a pilot, and Ellen swiftly fell in love with him, although the flashback strongly hints he had some capacity for arrogance and selfishness. Nevertheless, they soon married and, after the war, wound up in a leafy suburban Los Angeles neighborhood.
Unhappily, George is now confined to his bed with heart problems. There is a heat wave, and Ellen is spending most her time caring for him. George''s doctor is their old friend Ranney, with whom George thinks his wife is having an affair. In response, Ranney suggests George may need psychological help. After Ellen tells her bedridden husband she dreams of having children, he becomes angry. Meanwhile, George has written a letter to the district attorney in which he claims his wife and best friend are killing him with overdoses of medicine for his heart.
A little neighbor boy dressed as the movie and TV cowboy, Hopalong Cassidy, and wearing cap pistols (Bradley Mora) befriends the childless Ellen, who gives him cookies. He hands her a toy (fake) television set and asks Ellen to give it to George, which she does whilst serving her husband lunch in bed. He tells her an unsettling story about how, as a child, he had beaten a neighbor boy with a rake until he drew blood. Thinking the thick letter has something to do with insurance, Ellen gives it to the postman (Irving Bacon), who sees George in the upstairs bedroom window. When Ellen rushes up to find out why he has gotten out of bed, George lets her know what the letter says and who it is addressed to. George pulls a gun and is about to kill her when he drops dead on the bed. In her narration she describes George''s death as "one of those awful dreams."
Ellen panics over the letter and, as noted by a reviewer over 50 years later, throughout the film''s second half seems "much more concerned with absolving herself from the blame of his death than missing her spouse." Running from the house and shown the way by 2 teenagers in the film''s brief reference to Los Angeles'' mid-twentieth century jalopy culture, she chases down the overly talkative postman to whom she gave the letter; but he won''t give it back to her without talking to George first, since he wrote it. The postman says she can ask the supervisor at the downtown post office, who has more authority. Ellen is frantic when she gets back to the house, only to find George''s aunt Clara (Margalo Gillmore) climbing the stairs to see him and stops her barely in time. After the two talk for a while, Clara again heads up the stairs; but Ellen stops her once more, saying George told her earlier not to let his aunt see him. Clara leaves in a huff, telling her George was "rude, mean and selfish since he''s been six... he''s worse if anything."
Ellen goes back up to the bedroom to change her clothes and sees the gun still in George''s hand, narrating, "Somehow I knew I shouldn''t leave it there." As she wrenches the pistol from his hand, it fires. Readying herself to leave the house, a polite but somewhat aggressive notary (Don Haggerty) rings the doorbell, telling her he has an appointment with George to go over some legal documents. She steadfastly says George is too sick to see anyone. Ellen desperately drives downtown to the post office to see the supervisor, who gives her a form for George to sign but then, nettled by Ellen''s unhinged and uncooperative behavior, tells her he is going to allow the letter to be delivered. Defeated, she returns to the house and, as she gets to the front door, a kindly neighbor woman (Georgia Backus) offers to help Ellen, since she has seemed so upset all day.
When Ranney shows up to check on George, Ellen is hysterical. Ranney tells her to be calm and goes up to the bedroom. Showing no apparent emotion for his dead best friend, he sees the bullet hole in the floor, finds the gun in a dresser drawer, methodically repositions George''s body in the bed, and draws down the window shade. Back downstairs with Ellen, Ranney listens as she tells him what happened, saying "I did everything wrong, just like he said I would." The doorbell rings. She thinks the police have come to arrest her, but Ranney urges Ellen to open the door. When she does, it is the postman, returning the thick letter for insufficient postage. Ranney gives a sigh of relief; Ellen takes back the envelope and is overcome after closing the door. Ranney wordlessly rips the letter into narrow strips and burns these shreds in an ashtray along with a matchbook bearing the embossed names George and Ellen.','["Tay Garnett"]','["Mel Dinelli","Tom Lewis"]','["Loretta Young","Barry Sullivan","Bruce Cowling"]','["Crime","Drama","Film-Noir","Thriller"]','6.5','["tt0039324","tt0036886","tt0038346","tt0041187","tt0039372","tt0041503","tt0040153","tt0049621","tt0039730","tt0047479","tt0049857","tt0047877"]','["drama"]','[{"url":"/cause_for_alarm_1951.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/cause_for_alarm_1951_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/cause_for_alarm_1951_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','cause_for_alarm_1951',49000,'Q3031451','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

She encounters a dwarf hawking newspapers with the bold headline "Mysterious stabbing". She smiles enigmatically and quickly walks on. In a dark alley, a wino approaches and grabs her. A policeman rescues her and beats up the drunk as she leaves. Along her way, a pimp, with a pencil-thin mustache, and sharply dressed, approaches her, buys her a flower from a flower girl''s basket, and cajoles her into escorting a porcine rich man in a chauffeured limousine. As they cruise the through the night, she thinks back to her tragic youth and her abusive father. She had stabbed him to death with a switchblade after he shot and killed her unfaithful mother.
The rich man takes her to bars and nightclubs and finally to his elegant high-rise apartment. He first ignores her as he feasts on an extensive meal. She tempts him, and when he advances on her, she stabs him with her switchblade, pushing the dying man out of an upper story window. As he topples, he grabs the pendant around her neck, and it snaps off in his hand as he plummets. The crazed woman races out of the building onto the street and confronts the man''s corpse. The dead man''s hand still grasps her pendant in an iron grip, forcing her to saw it off with her knife. She flees while holding it, as she imagines faceless bystanders watching her impassively. Again, a patrol car appears. The same cop, with a strange frozen smile, tracks her with a spotlight as she runs; he appears to have her father''s face. She ducks around a corner, hiding the severed hand in the flower girl''s basket. 
As she runs down an alley, the pimp suddenly grabs her from inside a doorway and drags her into a club; an enthusiastic audience watches a jazz band playing. The smiling policeman enters, as the corpse of the rich man lies at the window pointing to his murderer with his bloody stump. The crowd moves forward, encircling her, laughing maniacally. She passes out, reawakening alone in her dingy hotel room. She goes to the mirror on the dresser and searches for clues.

MM88 is a deadly virus, created accidentally by an American geneticist, that amplifies the potency of any other virus or bacterium it comes into contact with. The Americans recover the virus sample, which was stolen from a lab in the US the year before, but the virus is accidentally released after the plane transporting it crashes, creating a pandemic initially known as the "Italian Flu".
Within seven months, virtually all the world''s population has died off. However, the virus is inactive at temperatures below -10 degrees Celsius, and the polar winter has spared the 855 men and eight women stationed in Antarctica. The British nuclear submarine HMS Nereid joins the scientists after sinking a Soviet submarine whose infected crew attempts to make landfall near Palmer Station.
Several years later, as the group is beginning to repopulate their new home, it is discovered that an earthquake will activate the Automated Reaction System (ARS) and launch the United States nuclear arsenal.
The Soviets have their own version of the ARS that will fire off their weapons in return, including one targeting Palmer Station. After all of the women and children and several hundred of the men are sent to safety aboard an icebreaker,  Yoshizumi and Major Carter embark aboard the Nereid on a mission to shut down the ARS, protected from MM88 by an experimental vaccine.
The submarine arrives at Washington, D.C., and Yoshizumi and Carter make a rush for the ARS command bunker. However, they reach the room too late, and all but those aboard the icebreaker perish in the nuclear exchange. Over the course of years Yoshizumi walks back towards Antarctica. Upon reaching Tierra del Fuego in 1988, he finds the survivors from the icebreaker, immunized by a since-developed vaccine.

Rutherford, intent on selling him a $200,000 insurance deal. Instead he finds that Rutherford has recently died and his mansion is now full of relatives who are, according to the will, all bound to remain in the mansion until a glass-domed vault is constructed on the roof, to house the deceased millionaire who was an ardent follower of the stars. Tuttle is mistaken for a private detective sent to guard the body, and once the confusion is cleared up and the real detective fails to show, he is convinced by Rutherford''s niece Carol Dunlap (Jean Parker) to remain and ensure that the body is not stolen. If the body should be buried any place other than the vault, the will states that recipients who would receive the largest request will receive the smallest, and vice versa. One of the recipients plans to reverse the will in their favor, hide the body and kill anyone who gets in their way. Unfortunately for mild-mannered Tuttle, he is directly in the way of the killer, and the rest of the conniving family.','["Frank McDonald"]','["Winston Miller","Maxwell Shane"]','["Jack Haley","Jean Parker","Bela Lugosi"]','["Comedy","Horror","Mystery"]','5.3','["tt0034613","tt0033760","tt0032390","tt0024727","tt0034546","tt0037084","tt0037441","tt0034224","tt0024382","tt0035640","tt0060097","tt0052969"]','["mystery; comedy; Bela Lugosi; Jack Haley"]','[{"url":"/One_Body_Too_Many.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/One_Body_Too_Many_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/One_Body_Too_Many_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','One_Body_Too_Many',18719,'Q7092493','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

It opens with Keaton attending a variety show.  In this first sequence, Keaton plays the conductor and every member of the orchestra, the actors, dancers, stagehands, minstrels, and every member of the audience, male and female. As an audience member, Keaton turns to the "woman" sitting beside him and remarks, "This fellow Keaton seems to be the whole show." This was a gibe at one of Keaton''s contemporaries, Thomas Ince, who credited himself generously in his film productions. In interviews with Kevin Brownlow, Keaton claims he gave the director''s credit to Cline mainly because he did not want to appear too Ince-like himself: "Having kidded things like that, I hesitated to put my own name on as a director and writer."
This elaborate trick-photography sequence turns out to be only a dream when Joe Roberts rouses Keaton from bed. The bedroom then turns out to be not a bedroom, but a set on a stage.
The second half of the film features Keaton''s character falling for a girl who happens to be a twin. He has difficulty telling the twin who likes him from the one who does not. An uncredited Virginia Fox plays one of the twins. Edward F. Cline co-wrote the production and appears, uncredited, as a monkey trainer, whose monkey Keaton impersonates onstage after accidentally letting the animal escape.',NULL,'["Buster Keaton","Edward F.

Later (or possibly before) in Yucca Flats, Nevada, Soviet scientist Joseph Javorsky (Johnson) has defected from the USSR and arrives in America with a briefcase carrying various military secrets, including the Soviet moon landing. Javorsky and his American contacts are suddenly attacked by a pair of KGB assassins (Cardoza and John Morrison) killing Javorsky''s contacts and bodyguards. Javorsky flees into the desert, walking for a great distance, and the searing heat causes him to discard much of his clothing. When he wanders in range of an American nuclear test, the bewildered Russian is transformed by it into a mindless beast with an uncontrollable urge to kill. He proceeds to murder a couple in their car on a nearby road, prompting pursuit from police officers Jim Archer (Stafford) and Joe Dobson (Aten).
Meanwhile, a vacationing family ventures along the same road. After stopping at a service station, the family''s two young sons (Ronald and Alan Francis) wander off into the surrounding desert where they eventually encounter and escape from the mutated Javorsky. Their father (Douglas Mellor) searches for them, but is mistaken for the killer by one of the police officers, who is searching for the murderer from the air in a small plane. The officer opens fire with a high-powered rifle on the innocent man, who manages to escape.
Eventually, the family is reunited and the police shoot and mortally wound Javorsky.

As the new leader, Johnny reiterates to his team the importance of their department and warns them that corruption is an ongoing hazard.
Johnny then goes out into the field with his naive partner, Patrick James "Aloysius" Haley, investigating merchants who are accused of using faulty measures and cheating the public. He ends up fining a market for adding lead weights to stewing chickens and fining a gas station for routinely shortchanging its customers. In each case, the merchants try to bribe Johnny in exchange for ignoring their corrupt practices, but he adamantly refuses. Meanwhile, Johnny''s fiancee, Janet Henry, criticizes him for being constantly hardheaded in his indefatigable pursuit of fighting corruption.
Later on, Cavanaugh offers Johnny a cushy job with his organization in exchange for turning a blind eye to his citywide racket. After he refuses, Johnny is framed for both drunk driving and a robbery, but is then "exonerated" by an ornery Cavanaugh, implying that he can make or break him. Afterwards, the mayor, a puppet for Cavanaugh, offers Johnny a high paying job, but once again he refuses.
When Johnny learns that Janet''s boss, Abel Canning, has been swindling a local orphanage by sending them half-shipments of food but charging them full-price, he declares that he''s going to expose him for the criminal that he is. Once he realizes that Canning is in an alliance with both the mayor and Cavanaugh, Johnny releases the orphanage story to the newspapers, which angers his fiancee and eventually leads to her breaking their engagement.
As Johnny prepares for the case against Canning, Cavanaugh hires a thug, ex-wrestler Joe Burton, to attack and steal the evidence from him. However, instead of turning over the evidence to Canning, Burton decides to blackmail him for $5,000. While at a big cocktail party, Canning gives Burton a $5,000 check in exchange for a key to his apartment where the evidence is hid. After Johnny notices Canning at the party with a skeleton key, he spots Burton exiting a side room. Johnny goes over to Burton and punches him in the face, then removes what he thinks is the stolen evidence from his jacket pocket, but instead discovers a check written by Canning. He then realizes that Canning is on his way to retrieve the evidence in Burton''s apartment.
Meanwhile, at the apartment, Canning and Cavanaugh locate the evidence hidden behind some wallpaper in a closet. They are about to burn the papers when Johnny arrives just in time, preventing them from destroying the evidence. Then, thanks to a tip by Janet, the police arrive moments later and arrest the two men. Later on, with Johnny and Janet''s engagement back on, he presents her with a ring that he got on the "installment plan," even though he knows it''s a racket.','["John G.

To find the problem, he sends a four-man crew on Flight 412, with Captain Bishop (David Soul) as commander. Lt Podryski (Greg Mullavey), Capt Riggs (Robert F. Lyons), and Lt Ferguson (Stanley Bennett Clay) are Bishop''s crew. Shortly into the test, the Grumman Gulfstream II jet, a small twin-engine VIP transport, picks up three blips on radar. Subsequently, two fighters scramble to investigate and mysteriously disappear.
At this point, Flight 412 is forced to land by an unnamed top-level military intelligence group that debunks UFO sightings (referred to throughout the film by their facility''s radio call sign "Digger Control", though this is never implied to be the organization''s actual name), diverted to a remote, abandoned military airfield somewhere in the desert in the American Southwest.  The crew is taken to a barracks building to undergo an 18-hour debriefing by members of a military Special Investigation Division (SID) team, which is more like an indoctrination to convince them that they did not see a UFO.  Meanwhile, their aircraft is stored in a dilapidated hangar to hide it from search-and-rescue aircraft.  To all appearances, Flight 412 has simply vanished into thin air. Colonel Moore, with the help of Major Mike Dunning (Bradford Dillman), sets out to find out what has happened to his crew.
Just as the government interrogation begins to raise doubts among the flight crew about the "flying saucer" sighting, Moore and Dunning find the secret base. Their efforts to release the crew are stymied by SID leader, Lieutenant Colonel Trottman (Guy Stockwell), who cites national security concerns. Bishop attempts to escape, but Trottman threatens to make things rough on his crew, who agree to accept a sanitized version of their report. After their release, when Dunning and Podryski choose to accept the report, the others: Moore, Bishop, Ferguson, and Riggs seek the help of General Enright (Kent Smith). Trottman appears and makes the case to the General that nothing untoward has happened. When a similar incident later occurs, the same process is employed; those who cooperate get promoted, while the others find that their careers suffer.','["Jud Taylor"]','["George Simpson","Neal R.

While examining it, the device''s quartz lenses are aligned and powerful energy beam erupts, causing an explosion, resealing the crypt. This allows young radio broadcaster and expedition member Billy Batson, who obeyed the warning on the crypt''s seal not to enter, to be chosen by the ancient wizard Shazam. The wizard grants Billy the powers of Captain Marvel whenever he repeats the wizard''s name. Captain Marvel''s powers can be used only to protect those in danger from the curse of the Golden Scorpion. The crypt''s entrance is quickly cleared, then Captain Marvel utters "Shazam!" and quickly resumes his Billy Batson alter ego.
The Golden Scorpion''s power lenses are divided among the scientists of the Malcolm Archaeological Expedition so that its power can only be used by agreement of the entire group, who then return to the U. S. after their discovery. An all-black-garbed-and-hooded criminal mastermind, calling himself the Scorpion, steals the ancient device after their return and sets about acquiring the distributed lenses. Several expedition members are killed in the Scorpion''s quest, despite Captain Marvel''s continual efforts to thwart his plan. Deducing that the Scorpion always seems to know what happens during the scientists'' meetings, Billy later confides to his friends, Betty Wallace and Whitey Murphy, his suspicion that the Scorpion may be one of the Malcolm archaeological team.
Discovering that one of the Golden Scorpion''s power lenses was purposely left behind, cleverly hidden in the very crypt where it was first discovered, Billy Batson and the surviving scientists agree it must be retrieved. They return by cargo ship to Siam where, near landfall, they barely survive a typhoon before finally being rescued by Captain Marvel. They eventually retrieve the hidden lens, but it is stolen by the Scorpion. By accident, from a distance, the Scorpion observes Captain Marvel transforming back into Billy Batson. Capturing Billy and gagging him, the Scorpion interrogates him about his secret. Billy''s tape gag is removed when he agrees to talk. "Shazam"! is his only response, and he transforms in a flash of light and smoke into Captain Marvel. The Scorpion''s identity is then revealed to be one of the last surviving scientists, who is killed by a Siamese native who turns the idol''s ray on him, vaporizing him.
Captain Marvel tosses the Golden Scorpion and its power lenses into a volcano''s molten lava to prevent them from ever being used for evil. Upon its destruction, Captain Marvel is instantly transformed back into Billy Batson forever, the danger from the device''s curse having now been eliminated.',NULL,'["Ronald Davidson","Norman S.

He struggles with the car door when exiting the car and then in paying the taxi driver (Albert Austin). When he gets to his front door, he thinks that he has forgotten the key and has to enter through the window. While climbing in through the window, he steps into a fishbowl that''s placed underneath it and then almost falls down when the carpet underneath him slides. After finding his balance again, he goes through his pockets and realises that the key has been there all the while. He goes back through the window and enters through the front door.
Inside the house, the furniture and other inanimate objects become almost insurmountable obstacles for the drunk. He struggles to balance on the sliding carpets and wonders whether he is wearing skates. Falling down, he lands between a tiger rug and a stuffed Eurasian lynx, which terrify him as he thinks they are real. He goes over to the table and tries to pour himself a drink, but first he accidentally spins the table top around and then does not manage to pour the drinks inside a glass. He then unsuccessfully attempts to light a cigarette, and then tries to head up the stairs to his bedroom. He fails several times in climbing them; a large cuckoo clock on the upstairs landing also poses a problem, due to its pendulum''s implausibly wide swing. He becomes increasingly creative with his attempts to climb the stairs, for example by using mountain climbing gear.
When he finally reaches his bedroom, he struggles to open his Murphy bed and ends up wrecking it. He gives up on the idea of sleeping in his bed and goes to bathroom. He enters the shower and accidentally turns it on.

('tt0013158','free','The Frozen North (1922)','1922','17min','The film opens near the "last stop", a subway terminal (apparently) in Alaska, which appears to be emerging from deep snow in the middle of nowhere. A tough-looking cowboy (Buster Keaton) emerges. He arrives at a small settlement, finding people gambling in a saloon. He tries to rob them by scaring them with a cutout taken from a poster of a man holding a gun, which he places at the window, to appear as if he has an accomplice. He tells the gamblers to raise their hands in the air. Frightened, they hand over their cash, but soon they find out the truth when a drunk man looks closer over the cutout and tips it over. Keaton attempts to hand the cash that he has been collecting back, but is thrown out through the window.

Next, he mistakenly enters a house thinking that it is his own house. Inside, from behind, he sees a man and a woman kissing before a fire. Thinking the woman is his wife, he gets red-hot angry and shoots the couple, moments later to realize his mistake, whereupon he makes his exit. He goes to his own house, where he finds his wife (Sybil Seely), who greets him, but he spurns her coldly, and she screams in anguish. She goes to a wall, and a vase drops on her head and knocks her unconscious; Keaton glances at her momentarily without interest, and then goes back to thinking again. While investigating the shooting of the couple, a passing policeman then knocks at Keaton''s door after hearing his wife scream. Keaton saves himself from arrest by playing music on gramophone and pretending to dance with his unconscious wife., acting as if all were normal. Seeing this, the officer turns and leaves again, and he drops her on the floor.
He looks out of the window and sees his pretty neighbor (Bonnie Hill). He quickly dons an elegant white suit and picks flowers (mysteriously growing from the deep snow; a sign reads "Keep Off the Grass"). He attempts to woo her, but she doesn''t appear to favor him. Her husband comes back inside to get something he forgot, and angrily takes his wife away with him after finding Keaton inside the house with her moments after he had left. Keaton bares his teeth threateningly at him as he leaves and they stare each other in the eye.
The neighbors leave on a sled for a new, even more bleak northerly location. Keaton gets a "car" (a cross between a dog sled and an early automobile, with an engine) driven by a friend (Joe Roberts) to follow them, but it breaks down, so he has to hail a passing "taxi" (a horse drawn sled with upholstery). The taxi is stopped by a traffic warden (riding a classic Harley-Davidson motorcycle frame mounted on skies driven by a pusher propeller - an actual mode of transport, not a joke for the film), but they get away: Keaton is up to his old tricks—he flips the propeller around to reverse the thrust, so after they drive off in the middle of the traffic stop, the officer goes backward into a lake when he restarts his engine to chase them. Near the north pole (sign: North Pole, 3 miles south; perhaps it means North Pole, Alaska?), he and Roberts find a hotel-like igloo with wall-hangings of a stag''s head and a guitar. In a gag Keaton tries to hang his hat on a stag head antler but it falls off. They attempt to survive by fishing in the manner of the Eskimos. Keaton makes snow-shoes from guitars and attempts to catch fish using tinned sardines as bait, but just creates trouble—he first falls through the ice and then tries to fish—but the only things he "catches" are another fisherman''s strung fish and the other fisherman himself!
Forced to flee back to the igloo, where his companion is using a carpet sweeper on the ice floor, Keaton sees his pretty neighbor again in her new hut. Apparently fortified by drinking a bottle of cola, grimacing as if it were strong liquor, he decides he will go and make another attempt to win or coerce the other woman. He appears at her hut, and enters, to her distress. Upon hearing the husband returning to the hut to show his wife some gold he had just panned out of the water, Keaton resolutely bars the door with his arm, to prevent the  husband from entering, only to discover the door hinges on the other side. After jumping and falling out the window, he disguises himself as a snowman to elude the husband when he runs out of the door in pursuit, and returns to the hut, where he is momentarily shown dressed as Erich von Stroheim''s character from the film Foolish Wives, to indicate his villainous intent to force himself on her (or her apprehension of his intent). The husband reappears outside, searching for his wife, scanning the horizon; while he is searching for her, Roberts approaches him wearing clumsy cross-country skies, without being noticed, and stabs him in the arm. The husband appears to punch the friend so hard he flies through the air and lands headfirst in the ice fishing hole from earlier in the film. The husband returns to find his wife weeping on the floor as Keaton stands over her. He pulls out his own knife, and wrestles with Keaton. Keaton''s wife appears outside the window, and shoots her husband in the back as they struggle. AS husband and wife embrace, the wounded Keaton lying on the floor takes a derringer from his pocket and points it at the husband, but at that moment a janitor wakes Keaton up in the front row of a film theater (the gun in the last scene turns out to be a folded newspaper in his hand) and Keaton realizes that it was all a dream!',NULL,'["Edward F.

('tt0016039','free','The Lost World (1925)','1925','1h 46min','From a lost expedition to a plateau in Venezuela, Paula White brings the journal of her father explorer Maple White to the eccentric Professor Challenger in London. The journal features sketches of dinosaurs which is enough proof for Challenger to publicly announce that dinosaurs still walk the earth. Met with ridicule at an academic meeting at the Zoological Hall, Challenger reluctantly accepts a newspaper''s offer to finance a mission to rescue Maple White. Professor Challenger, Paula White, sportsman Sir John Roxton, news reporter Edward Malone (who is a friend of Roxton and wishes to go on the expedition to impress his fiancée), a skeptical professor Summerlee, an Indian servant Zambo, and Challenger''s butler Austin leave for the plateau.
At their campsite at the base of the plateau, the explorers are shocked when a large rock falls, sent their way by an Apeman perched on top of an overhead ledge. As the crew look up to see their attacker, Challenger spies overhead a Pteranodon (mistakenly calling it a Pterodactylus) killing and eating a young Toxodon which proves that the statements in Maple White''s diary are true. Leaving Zambo and Austin at the camp, they cross a chasm onto the plateau by cutting down a tree and using it as a bridge, but it is knocked over by a Brontosaurus, leaving them trapped.
The explorers witness various life-and-death struggles between the prehistoric beasts of the plateau. An Allosaurus attacks an Edmontosaurus, and knocks it into a bog. The Allosaurus then attacks, and is driven off by a Triceratops. Eventually, the Allosaurus makes its way to the campsite and attacks the exploration party. It is finally driven off by Ed who tosses a torch into its mouth. Convinced that the camp is not safe, Ed climbs a tree to look for a new location, but is attacked by the apeman. Roxton succeeds in shooting the apeman, but the creature is merely wounded and escapes before he can finish him off. Meanwhile, an Agathaumas is attacked by the Allosaurus, and gores it to death. Suddenly, a Tyrannosaurus attacks and kills the Agathaumas, along with an unfortunate Pteranodon.
The explorers then make preparations to live on the plateau potentially indefinitely. A catapult is constructed and during a search for Maple White, Roxton finds his remains, confirming his death. It is at this time that Ed confesses his love for Paula and the two are unofficially wed by Summerlee who used to be a minister.
Shortly afterwards, as the paleontologists are observing the Brontosaurus, an Allosaurus attacks it and the Brontosaurus falls off the edge of the plateau, becoming trapped in a mud bank at the base of the plateau. Soon afterwards, a volcano erupts causing a mass stampede among the giant creatures of the lost world. The crew is saved when Paula''s pet monkey Jocko climbs up the plateau carrying a rope. The crew use the rope to pull up a rope ladder constructed by Zambo and Austin and then climb down.
As Ed makes his descent, he is again attacked by the apeman who pulls the rope ladder. The apeman is again shot and finally killed by Roxton. They discover the Brontosaurus that had been pushed off the plateau had landed softly in the mud of the river, trapped but still alive, and Challenger manages to bring it back to London, as he wants to put it on display as proof of his story.
However, while being unloaded from the ship it escapes and causes havoc until it reaches Tower Bridge, where its massive weight causes a collapse, and it swims down the River Thames. Challenger is morose as the creature leaves. Ed discovers that the love he left in London has married in his absence, allowing him and Paula to be together. Roxton morosely but gallantly hides his love for Paula as Paula and Ed leave together, while two passersby note: "That''s Sir John Roxton—sportsman."','["Harry O.

After this, we meet four monsters (Mr. Hyde, Fu Manchu, the Phantom of the Opera, and Frankenstein''s monster) who introduce themselves roaring, but then dance briefly to Gossec''s "Gavotte." As characters from other books cheer that performance, the protagonist of The Good Earth, his head the shape of a globe, says prayers by his bedside. The camera pans the library to the right, revealing the book The Invisible Man and an invisible man dancing, who hands off to Topper (a novel from a series by Thorne Smith, as well as a contemporary film) where a similar character continues a similar dance, then moves to The Thirty-Nine Steps where a caricature of "Bojangles" Robinson dances down the steps, So Big with a caricature of Greta Garbo, and The Green Pastures which turns out to feature a big band presentation of "Swing for Sale" led by a caricature of Cab Calloway. That clip was from the Friz Freleng short Clean Pastures.
Panning left over the cheering crowd, the camera reveals a singing Heidi on the cover of her eponymous book, a literal Thin Man when viewed from the side (a caricature of William Powell as Nick Charles) walking into the White House Cook Book and, when walking back out and seen from the side, shows that he has packed on some weight in his posterior. Whistler''s Mother, on the cover of the book, Great Works of Art whistles "Ain''t She Sweet", then three Little Women (three Jane Withers clones) and three Little Men (three Freddie Bartholomew clones) sing with Old King Cole (spoofing deep-voiced Warners character actor Eugene Pallette), the characters of The House of the Seven Gables (seven identical caricatures of Clark Gable), and a drumming bulldog intended to parody Bulldog Drummond. Next Louis Pasteur (a caricature of Paul Muni in his Oscar-winning role) mixes chemicals from test tubes until they blow up, after which Pasteur is in Seventh Heaven. Also appearing is Captain William Bligh from Mutiny on the Bounty (a caricature of Charles Laughton''s portrayal of him). None of this pleases a sleeping Rip Van Winkle (Ned Sparks, a well-known Hollywood "grouch"); the hermit complains, "Old King Cole is a noisy old soul", while using the Valiant Little Tailor''s scissors to snip hair from the title character of Uncle Tom''s Cabin to plug his ears.
The music gets louder, as The Three Musketeers (The Ritz Brothers) sing the title song of the cartoon, with Drums Along the Mohawk providing a beat, Emily Post (here portrayed as "Emily Host") scolds Henry VIII of England for his rudeness, and a character from Katherine Mayo''s controversial 1927 book Mother India plays along on his pungi.  Then Rip again takes scissors from the Tailor and tries to use them once more on Uncle Tom; Tom beats him back then uses the scissors to cut Rip''s beard.   Then Diamond Jim Brady (an Edward Arnold caricature, from the 1935 film of the same name) comes along pitching mortgage payments as the Drums beat louder, Henry becomes even more gluttonous (and Emily Post joins in the gluttony), and Oliver Twist twists.  W.C. Fields (here portrayed with a red nose in a parody of So Red the Rose) joins in, as does the Pied Piper of Hamelin, piping a jazzy tune and being followed by a herd of jazzy mice.
The Musketeers become Three Men on a Horse and, along the way grab the Seven Keys to Baldpate which they use to free the Prisoner of Zenda, over Aladdin''s objections. Aladdin gets punched out by one of the Men.  As the Three Men pass The Informer (a caricature of Victor McLaglen, who won a 1935 Academy Award for playing the role), he whispers to Little Boy Blue (here named "Little Boy Blew") who then trumpets for a Charge of the Light Brigade.

('tt0023985','free','The Emperor Jones (1933)','1933','1h 12min','The film is based rather loosely on O''Neil''s play, but adds an entire backstory before O''Neill''s actual play begins, and includes several new characters that do not appear in it (such as Jones'' wife, and a friendly priest who advises him to give up his evil ways). Some people considered the movie to be just a vehicle for displaying Robeson''s famous musical talent (he sings a number of times in the film). However, the film does provide what may be Robeson''s greatest dramatic performance in a movie, considered by many to be worthy of an Oscar nomination that it did not receive.In the film version, the opening shots are of an African ritual dance. Some critics are quick to assess the opening as representative of the "primitive" black world to which Brutus Jones will eventually revert. However, more scholarly reviews of the film understand the complexities of the allusion to and comparison between the roots of the African-American church and the rhythmic chanting often seen in African religious practices.  As discussed further, below, its director, Dudley Murphy, had co-directed Ballet Mecanique and other musically-based experimental films. Having just spent several years in Hollywood, he now craved the freedom to use musical forms as way of translating O''Neill''s experimentation on stage into a film form. Paul Robeson was already a musical star, and would go on to study traditional African music and dance while on location in Nigeria and with scholars in London.
A quick dissolve takes us into a Baptist church in the American South, where the dancing of the congregation presents an image that argues for a continuity between the "savage" Africans and the ring-shout Baptists. Such suggestive editing may be the kind of element that causes viewers to suspect the film of racism.
Similarly, the film makes copious use of the word "nigger", as did O''Neill''s original play. African Americans criticized O''Neill''s language at the time, so its preservation and expansion in the film present another cause for critique. In fact, in the original production in 1920, the actor playing Jones, Charles Sidney Gilpin, a leading man in the all-African American Lafayette players, objected to the use of the word "nigger" to playwright Eugene O''Neill and began substituting "Negro" in the Provincetown Players premiere. He continued to do so when the show went on tour for two years in the States. In this, he reflected the African-American community''s problematic relationship with the play.O''Neill, an ex-sailor who freely used offensive epithets, had based the character, down to some specific traits and use of language, on an African-American friend from the New England waterfront, and felt the use of the word was dramatically justified. They could not come to a reconciliation and O''Neill gave the part to the much younger and then-unknown Paul Robeson for the 1924 New York revival and then its London premiere, both of which launched Robeson as the first black leading man of heretofore white American and British theater. Given Robeson''s subsequent career as a Civil Rights activist, his character using the term so frequently in regard to other blacks seems shocking today, but Robeson would not have had his impact on civil rights had he never played this role. It made him a star, in a way that virtually no other part in the 1920s and ''30s could have done; with its powerful visions of a slave ship and being sold at auction, the role of Brutus Jones had a scope and a reality that no American play had had for a black man before. Robeson often struggled with the inherent racist and imperialist limits of what few leading man roles there were for a black actor then and ran into criticism at the time because of it (see Sanders of the River, a 1935 film set in Nigeria).',NULL,'["Eugene O''Neill","DuBose Heyward"]','["Paul Robeson","Dudley Digges","Frank H.

Richard Houston (Richard Arlen) is an officer in the U.S. Navy who deserted during peacetime service to escape gambling debts, and took up life as a hobo. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor spurs him to rejoin the Navy under the assumed name of Jim "Tennessee" Smith. Houston is assigned to serve aboard a minesweeper, where he carries out numerous successful efforts to defuse mines in the San Diego harbor while struggling to keep his identity secret.
Complicating matters, Houston gets involved in a love triangle, competing with Seaman Elliot Nash (Russell Hayden) for the affections of Mary Smith (Jean Parker), niece of Chief Petty Officer "Fixit" Smith (Guinn "Big Boy" Williams), who has taken a liking to Houston. Later, while gambling, Houston overstays his shore leave and Smith, having taken over his position, is killed by a mine. 
Confessing to Mary that he was out gambling to get the money to buy an engagement ring, Houston is crestfallen that by being AWOL, he was responsible for the death of his friend. Houston nearly deserts again, but instead returns to his base to take on one last mission. Reporting back to duty, he finds that his immediate superior, Lt. Ralph Gilpin (Frank Fenton), has discovered his true identity. Nonetheless, even as a "prisoner-at-large", Houston volunteers to help clear the shipping lanes of mines to ensure a troop ship can safely leave the harbor to join a convoy off to the Pacific.  
When Houston and Nash dive in San Diego harbor to find a Japanese mine, the two divers see that the mine reacts to the sound of an aircraft overhead, beginning to rise from its tethered location as the sound waves reach it. Nash relays the information to Lt. Gilpin on the diving launch, but Houston cuts Nash''s oxygen line, forcing the crew on the diving launch to pull him up to safety. Working on his own, Houston attempts to open the control panel when the mine explodes, killing him. On board the diving launch, Nash tells the crew that Houston was a true hero. 
Giplin realizes that he can counter the threat of the mines by flying aircraft low over the water where they can be blown up after they rise to the surface. Looking at the cable he received about the deserter, he tears it up and drops it overboard.
A Consolidated PBY Catalina flying at low level triggers the release of the acoustically sensitive mines in San Diego harbor, allowing the minesweepers to blow up each mine. As the operation finishes, the Secretary of the Navy sends a message indicating that the Navy and Marine Corps Medal has been posthumously bestowed on Gunner''s Mate First Class James Smith, United States Naval Reserve.','["William Berke"]','["Edward T.

Carrol Naish), the last descendant of the original Dr. Frankenstein, takes to murdering young girls for experimentation in hopes of perfecting a blood serum of his own creation with help from his mute, simple-minded assistant Groton (Lon Chaney, Jr.). Count Dracula (Roger Engel (producer Al Adamson''s stockbroker) listed in the film''s credits under the pseudonym "Zandor Vorkov") comes to the scientist, promising to help him revive the Frankenstein Monster (which he has exhumed from its secret grave in Oakmoor Cemetery) in return for Durea''s serum, which he hopes will grant him immunity to sunlight.
As a cover, the duo work out of a secret laboratory hidden behind the Creature Emporium, a haunted house exhibit and a throwback to the old sideshow days located on the boardwalk amusement park in Venice, California. They bring the Monster (John Bloom) back to life and Durea sends him and Dracula out to exact revenge on the man who both discredited him and crippled him in a fire, Dr. Beaumont (Forrest J. Ackerman). Las Vegas showgirl Judith Fontaine has also previously arrived, looking for her missing sister Joanie (Maria Lease) who was last seen hanging out with a group of hippies led by Strange (Greydon Clark). Judith has gotten no satisfaction from Sgt. Martin (Jim Davis). She says she is going to investigate on her own and does so, attracting the attention of biker Rico (Russ Tamblyn) and his gang. Rico slips her some LSD at a dive bar with the bartender''s help and Judith, while on a trip due to the drug, is taken by Strange and his girlfriend Samantha (Anne Morrell), who have just finished attending a protest, to the home of aging hippie Mike Howard (Anthony Eisley) who agrees to help her find Joanie. Judith, Mike, Samantha and Strange go to the Creature Emporium (which Joanie had been known to go to many times) and Judith shows Durea a picture of Joanie, asking her if he has seen her, but he says that he never has.
More girls turn up missing, the Monster kills a couple of police officers while trying to kill a girl for Durea''s experiments and Groton takes to the beach with an ax and kills Rico and his gang who were attacking Samantha, then Groton takes her into Durea''s laboratory through a trap door with a ladder that leads to the beach below the Creature Emporium. Judith and Mike go to the Emporium, discover the trap door and the laboratory and confront Durea, who explains that the girls who were killed (including Joanie, whom Judith finds preserved, naked, unmoving and seemingly neither dead or alive, in a glass-fronted box (with strategically-placed wide black lines on the glass that are over her breasts and vagina) in the laboratory, along with Samantha who is in another identical box, in a similar state of nakedness and immobility and also seemingly neither dead or alive) were frightened before their deaths and this created a special enzyme in their blood which is the main ingredient for his blood serum. He also tells Judith that, after he has Mike (with whom she has fallen in love and he with her) killed, her fear upon seeing Mike''s death will help him complete the serum at last (it is implied, therefore, that she will be killed as well). Durea sends Groton and a dwarf named Grazbo (Angelo Rossitto), the ticket taker at the Creature Emporium, after the couple (Durea''s original reason for creating the blood serum in the first place was to heal his crippled legs and to transform Groton and Grazbo into normal people). Grazbo falls through the laboratory''s trap door (which was accidentally opened) to the beach and onto an ax that he had dropped beforehand while holding on to the ladder, which kills him, and Groton goes after Judith. Sgt. Martin and Strange arrive with the police and Martin shoots Groton from the rooftop of the building from which he falls to his death, while Durea falls from his wheelchair into a guillotine display in the Emporium while attempting to escape and is beheaded in it.
Dracula meets Judith, hypnotizes her and binds her with rope to a railing. He then confronts Mike, who shoves a lit car flare in the Monster''s face, forcing him to briefly turn on Dracula in his pain. Mike unties Judith and they run away, but as they do so, Dracula blasts Mike with fire shot out from his one-eyed demon-headed ring, burning him to ashes.
Judith faints upon seeing Mike''s death and slowly awakens to find herself bound with rope again to a chair in an abandoned and desecrated church in a wooded area outside of Venice where Dracula''s coffin is located. Dracula is about to drink her blood and turn her into his vampire bride, but the Monster (who has fallen for her beauty) turns against Dracula and forces him out of the church and into the woods (but not before removing Dracula''s ring from his finger before exiting the church), where a fierce battle ensues between the two monsters. Dracula literally tears off the Monster''s arms and head, but gets caught in the rays of the sun before he can make it back to his coffin and slowly disintegrates into dust. Judith manages to free herself and sees Dracula''s remains and clothing. She then picks up Dracula''s ring at the door of the church, but, after a brief flashback of all that has happened to her before, drops it and flees in fear.',NULL,'["William Pugsley","Samuel M.

But before her death, Selwyn and her accomplice Jethrow Keane sold their souls to Lucifer for eternal life and revenge on Whitewood in return of providing the Devil with two yearly virgin human sacrifices on the Hour of Thirteen during Candlemas Eve and the Witches'' Sabbath.
In the present day, following his lecture on witchcraft, a university history professor named Alan Driscoll advises an interested student named Nan Barlow to visit Whitewood during her vacation to slake her interest in witchcraft by studying the town''s history. Nan settles in The Raven''s Inn, a hotel owned by eccentric Mrs. Newless, becoming acquainted with the town''s only normal-seeming local resident Patricia Russell who loans her a book on witchcraft. Soon learning that the night is Candlemas Eve while reading the book, Nan is eventually lured down to the basement and is restrained on a satanic altar by Mrs. Newless and members of her coven. Mrs. Newless reveals herself to be Elizabeth Selwyn before proceeding to sacrifice Nan. Two weeks later, Nan''s concerned fiancé Bill Maitland and her brother Richard learn that the Raven Inn does not exist in any phone directory before they are visited by Patricia, who is also concerned with Nan''s disappearance.
The two men separately travel to Whitewood soon after, Bill barely surviving a car crash caused by an apparition of Selwyn. Richard reaches Whitewood and meets up with Patricia before visiting her grandfather Reverend Russell, who reveals Whitewood to be under the control of Selwyn''s coven. Soon after, Patricia is kidnapped as the coven''s sacrifice, Richard attempting to save her before they are cornered in the graveyard as Professor Driscoll is revealed to a coven member. But a severely-injured Bill arrives at the late minute and succeeds in pulling out a cross after being fatally wounded by Selwyn, using the last of his strength to burn the coven members alive under the cross''s shadow. Selwyn escapes during the chaos, but her pact with the Devil is undone by the intervention as Richard and Patricia find her charred corpse in the hotel that is revealed to built on the site of her burning.','["John Llewellyn Moxey"]','["George Baxt","Milton Subotsky"]','["Patricia Jessel","Dennis Lotis","Christopher Lee"]','["Horror","Mystery","Thriller"]','6.8','["tt0056279","tt0060307","tt0062885","tt0053925","tt0055505","tt0051554","tt0024894","tt0050280","tt0063285","tt0068713","tt0037415","tt0050766"]','["Horror;Witchcraft;Christopher Lee;1960s"]','[{"url":"/Horror_Hotel.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Horror_Hotel_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/Horror_Hotel_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','Horror_Hotel',225622,'Q194106','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Bugs is led to a trunk where he tricks the hunter into destroying the tree. Bugs distracts the hunter after introducing himself, and digs underground and when the hunter realizes that Bugs has his gun. Bugs has the hunter run far enough so he can go down the rabbit hole. Realizing that he has been had, the hunter uses a toilet plunger to catch Bugs. However, Bugs tickles the hunter and flees into another rabbit hole. The hunter grabs the plunger, only to find a skunk under him. Next, Bugs lures the hunter into a cave, where they encounter a black bear. All three of them run into the rabbit hole and when Bugs and the hunter realize the bear is in the hole, they run off in fright.
Realizing that Bugs is on the hunter while walking, the hunter fires off a swarm of anthropomorphic birdshot bullets. In a madcap chase, the bullets chase Bugs into a series of holes, including a "fake" golf hole and the cave where the skunk is at. Bugs then lures the hunter into a log sitting on the edge of a cliff, through which the hunter runs numerous times (each time running to the other side as Bugs spins the log around so that the hunter keeps running off the cliff) until he falls to the ground. Bugs is confronted by the angered hunter and, in a desperate plea for his life, baits the hunter into playing what turns out to be a "strip" dice game. Bugs wins the game and walks off mocking the hunter''s speech and wearing the hunter''s clothes, leaving the man with a leaf covering his crotch to ad-lib "Well, call me Adam."

In prison, Sartet got to know an electrician involved in setting up an extensive security system at a diamond exhibition in Rome — the electrician returned home early, unannounced, caught his wife in bed with a lover and shot them. Unaccustomed to prison life, he made friends with Sartet and bit-by-bit supplied him with details of the exhibition and its security system.
Vittorio and a fellow Mafiose, Tony Nicosia of New York City, go to the exhibition, only to find that changes make a simple robbery difficult. Furthermore, the exhibition hall is near a police station. Nicosia instead comes up with a plan to steal the diamonds while they are en route to another exhibition in New York and sends over Jack, an alcoholic, in order to pass on the details.
Meanwhile, Commissaire Le Goff pursues Sartet with unbridled determination — the gangster having killed two of his men in cold blood during an earlier arrest. Guessing that Sartet needs false papers in order to leave the country, Le Goff''s enquiries lead him to the Manalese and their arcade game business which serves as a cover for their illegal activities. While he questions Vittorio, Sartet slips out of the building, under Le Goff''s nose.
Jeanne, the wife of Vittorio''s son Aldo and an able crook, becomes fascinated by Sartet. She has always felt out of place as the only French person in the Sicilian clan. While hiding out, she attracts Sartet''s attention by sunbathing nude but as they kiss they are seen by Luigi''s six-year-old son Roberto. Jeanne gets the boy to promise not to mention it to anyone.
In Rome, the gang discreetly kidnap Edward Evans, the insurance man sent to oversee the transfer of the diamonds to New York. Sartet takes his place and joins the other officials accompanying the diamonds on a regular scheduled flight. Among the passengers joining the plane are Jack, Jeanne, Vittorio and his sons. Things almost go wrong when Evans'' wife turns up, but Vittorio leads her to believe that her husband''s same numbered flight is on the following day.
Having failed to contact, Mrs Evans goes to the police. At police HQ, she identifies Sartet as one of the men she saw on the plane. Meanwhile, the plane is making its descent towards New York when the gang hijacks the aircraft.
Warned of Sartet''s imminent arrival in the United States, the local police race to the airport while the plane lands on a highway which has been closed off by gang''s local members. Other Mafia men waiting in cars unload the diamonds from the plane and split up, Jack for Canada and the Manalese for Paris. Intending to move to Veracruz, Sartet hides out in New York while awaiting his share of the proceeds.
Back home, late one evening, the Manalese are watching a film which includes a scene of a couple making out. Roberto exclaims that it looks just what Sartet has done with Jeanne. Jeanne denies the affair but the others tend to believe it. They lure Sartet back to Paris with the promise to give him his share. Jeanne calls Sartet''s sister Monique to warn him of the trap. Monique await him at the airport but learns that he boarded an earlier flight. 
Sartet contacts Vittorio for his share in the jewelry loot meets him, accompanied by Jeanne, on a quiet road outside town. Vittorio shoots both him and Jeanne dead. Leaving both bodies, along with Sartet''s money for the police to take care of, Vittorio returns home but is arrested there by Le Goff.','["Henri Verneuil"]','["Auguste Le Breton","Henri Verneuil"]','["Jean Gabin","Alain Delon","Lino Ventura"]','["Crime","Drama"]','7.4','["tt0057344","tt0069967","tt0061376","tt0065486","tt0071241","tt0065531","tt0067900","tt0072996","tt0082935","tt0071557","tt0056636","tt0062229"]','["1969; legendado; portugues; portuguese; Henri Verneuil; Alain Delon; Jean Gabin;"]','[{"url":"/LeClanDesSiciliens1969-OsSicilianos.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/LeClanDesSiciliens1969-OsSicilianos_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','LeClanDesSiciliens1969-OsSicilianos',10439,'Q1192783','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Her extensive knowledge of the paper industry, the mill and its clients allows her to have input in company operations far outweighing her job title. As the president of the company, Ritter (Charles Sellon), approaches retirement, Mary uses her skill in company politics to enable James to make some important sales coups, after which she begins a fifth-column attempt to get him named as the next president. James, for his part, is grateful to her for her help, but is completely oblivious to her romantic interest in him, preferring more the party girl type.
When Ritter does retire, James wins the position, and Mary is promoted to be his personal secretary. Still unaware of her feelings, he hires his latest party girl, Daisy (Edna Murphy), to work in the office, and report to Mary. Mary is upset by this turn of events, but remains faithful to James, assisting him with running the company. In fact, it is her knowledge and acumen which makes the company successful. Mary even spurns the advances of several men, including the wealthy Ronnie Wales (Ricardo Cortez), who, although married, is estranged from his wife and wishes to pursue an affair with Mary.

She resigns from the company, and eventually agrees to go away with Ronnie for an assignation in Atlantic City. The paper mill suffers terribly from a lack of good management, since most of James'' success was due to Mary''s guidance.

Unbeknownst to his society acquaintances, he is also the leader of the largest mob in the city.  But it is a mob with scruples, thanks to Fenmore, and they only prey on dishonest businessmen, and never shoot or kill anyone.  However, there is a power struggle developing between Fenmore and his number two man, Rocky, who disagrees with the moral constraints put on the gang by Fenmore. The tension between the two men is exacerbated by the fact Rocky has taken Fenmore''s girlfriend, Dot away from him.
As he starts to exert his influence on the other gang members, Rocky holds up a young engaged couple, Nancy and Tommy, of their last few dollars for the fun of it. When Fenmore hears of the robbery, he gives them back their money and takes them under his wing, offering the both of them jobs on the legitimate side of his business.  When Rocky sees that Fenmore has taken a liking to the couple, he develops a plan to use them in order to take over Fenmore''s gang. Even though Fenmore has given explicit orders not to involve the couple in the illicit activities of the gang, Rocky takes them along when he goes to hold up a jewelry store.  When the robbery goes wrong, Rocky ends up shooting and killing the owner of the store, after which he frames Tommy and Annabelle for the crime.
In order to set things right, Fenmore orchestrates a confrontation with the police, wherein he confesses to the jewelry store robbery, and in the ensuing melee, Rocky is killed.  As he is led off in handcuffs, Fenmore turns to the police officer and says, "If it wasn''t for men like me, they wouldn''t need men like you."','["Lowell Sherman"]','["Samuel Shipman","John B.

The film was jointly produced by the J. Arthur Rank Organisation and the Army Film and Photographic Unit (AFPU).Weaving original footage from the battle with re-enactments shot on location at Oosterbeek and Arnhem, the film was shot a year after the battle had ravaged the Dutch streets. As well as veterans, the film also features local people like Father Dyker (a Dutch civilian priest who conducts the service in the film) and Kate ter Horst (who reads a psalm to the wounded men in the cellar) re-enacting their roles and what they did for the airborne troops during the battle.
Though no credits appear before or after the film, over 200 veterans appeared as actors including Majors CFH "Freddie" Gough and Richard "Dickie" Lonsdale, Lieutenant Hugh Ashmore, Sergeants Jack Bateman and John Daley, Corporal Pearce and Privates Tommy Scullion, Peter Holt, David Parker, George ‘Titch’ Preston, Frank ‘Butch’ Dixon, Reginald Spray, Looker and Van Rijssel and  war correspondents Stanley Maxted and Alan Wood. Each veteran was paid £3 per day by the Rank Organisation.
The narrator notes the soldiers as "just ordinary men". "But when you next watch the film look closely at the faces of the men and especially at their eyes in the many close shots that Brian Desmond Hurst arranged. When you look into the eyes you will start to gain a little bit of the experience that those ordinary men went through".The film may have been the "Help for Heroes of its day". Hurst''s biographer, Allan Esler Smith in "Theirs Is the Glory - 65th Anniversary of the filming of the movie" explains that "The popularity of Theirs Is the Glory allowed Arthur Rank, the head of the Rank Organisation, to fulfill his pledge to help the Airborne Forces Security Fund. Collections, raffles and parades rode the wave of enthusiasm that swept the United Kingdom following its premier. The Earl Mountbatten subsequently received a cheque for £50,000 for the Airborne Forces Security Fund from Arthur Rank".
Brian Desmond Hurst said, "The film is my favourite because of the wonderful experience of working with soldiers, and because it is a true documentary reconstruction of the event. I say without modesty it is one of the best war films ever made".','["Brian Desmond Hurst"]',NULL,'["Stanley Maxted","Thomas Scullion","Allan Wood"]','[""]','7.1','["tt0075784","tt0074452","tt0056197","tt0050803","tt0043039","tt0051532","tt0066473","tt0056937","tt0046161","tt0046029","tt0050565","tt0074921"]','["WWII","Operation Market Garden","World War, 1939-1945","World War II","Arnhem, Battle of, Arnhem, Netherlands, 1944"]','[{"url":"/TheirsIsTheGlory1946.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/TheirsIsTheGlory1946_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','TheirsIsTheGlory1946',20548,'Q2937631','wp','["Louis Golding"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The film opens with a map showing the strategic importance of the island, and the thrust of the 1942 Japanese offensive into Midway and Dutch Harbor. Photographs of the pilots who beat the Japanese back at Dutch Harbor are passed before the camera. "There is no monument to these men. If you want to see their monument, look around you."
The American forces dug in at Adak Island, and there commenced daily bombing missions over the Japanese who had taken Kiska. The film focuses on their routine activities such as harbor patrols, messes, news boards and mail call. "Ask any pilot. He''d tell you he''d gladly fly an extra trip over Kiska to get just one letter." One pilot''s crash landing is shown, and his funeral is filmed.
The last twenty minutes or so of the film is taken from footage taken over a mission over Japanese positions. The monotony of the one-hour trip there is emphasized, noting that some have taken up "mental solitaire" on the way over. But at Kiska there is no lack of excitement, as several loads of bombs are dropped over the Japanese, and fire is exchanged by the tailgunner. At the end of the film the servicemen at Adak are shown rejoicing that all of their comrades have returned.
Huston included shots showing the monotony of Army life, e.g. latrine digging and cigarette smoking, and Army authorities objected to the inclusion of these scenes.

In desperation, they send for their best agent, currently undercover in Germany. Pilot Frank Bennett (Bruce Lester) is sent to pick him up, but the Germans are forewarned and Bennett is shot down. Luckily, he survives and is rescued by friendly soldiers. While recovering in a hospital, Bennett is tended by a pretty nurse, Helene Von Lorbeer (Margaret Lindsay). He tells her he loves her, but she informs him she is leaving, and they will not see each other again. However, after Bennett falls asleep, she kisses him on the cheek.
Von Lorbeer turns out to be a spy herself. She is recalled to Germany to receive a high honor sent personally by the Kaiser and to undertake a new mission. Posing as a refugee named Frances Hautry, she infiltrates the London household of Arthur Bennett (Holmes Herbert), a cabinet minister, and, coincidentally, Frank''s father. She takes her orders from Valdar (Boris Karloff), the butler. However, unbeknownst to her, he is a British double agent. Valdar later secretly reports to Colonel Yeats (Leonard Mudie), the head of British Intelligence.
When Bennett''s secretary, also a German spy, taps out a secret message in code on her typewriter, Yeats is present and recognizes it. Since only Hautry is also in the office at the time, he sets a trap for her. A captured spy named Kurz seemingly escapes from the British and flees to Hautry''s bedroom. She hides him in her closet, but then betrays him when Yeats and his men show up. Afterwards, she tells Valdar that she knew "Kurz" was an imposter.
Frank Bennett unexpectedly shows up, his squadron and others having been recalled to London for some reason. He is surprised to find his former nurse there and under a different name. Hautry is forced to reveal that she is loyal to the British. However, Valdar overhears their conversation.
That night, the British cabinet meets in Bennett''s home. It is the moment Valdar has been waiting for. He forces Hautry at gunpoint down in the cellar, where he has set a bomb to blow the house up under cover of a Zeppelin bombing raid. Hautry tells Valdar that she had no choice but to make up a story to allay Frank''s suspicions. Convinced when she shows him the award she was given, Valdar finally reveals that he is Strendler.
Fortunately, Valdar has been under surveillance. Yeats and his men rush to the cellar door. When Valdar escapes through the coal shute, Hautry unlocks the door and informs Yeats about the bomb. Valdar rushes to his hideout to transmit the stolen British plans for the spring offensive, pursued by the British, but, ironically, a Zeppelin bombs the location and kills him and his confederates before he can send his information.','["Terry O.

('tt0034985','free','The Living Ghost (1942)','1942','1h 1min','This is a low-budget criminal melodramatic story with faint horror movie tendencies. Lead character Nick Trayne is played by future Academy award-winner James Dunn. Nick Trayne is a slightly eccentric former private detective who has retired to pursue a more leisurely occupation gets lured back into business to investigate the disappearance of a banker - Walter Craig (Gus Glassmire). It is the banker''s best friend, Ed Moline (Paul McVey) who hires him after the banker has disappeared from his home.
At the banker''s estate, Nick meets his whole family, consisting of Craig''s second wife Helen (Edna Johnson), his snobby daughter Tina (Jan Wiley), her fiancé Arthur Wallace (Howard Banks), Walter''s nutty sister, Delia Phillips (Minerva Urecal), and her husband George (J. Arthur Young), as well as Walter''s friend and former partner, Tony Weldon (George Eldredge).
Nick cooperates with Craig''s cheeky secretary, Billie Hilton (Joan Woodbury), on this case. He starts out with questioning Craig''s more than alarmingly suspicious friends and relatives. When Nick is busy doing his interviews the missing banker suddenly returns. Craig isn''t quite himself - he is seemingly lobotomized, looking more like a zombie than anything with the slightest resemblance to a living breathing thing.
Luckily enough there is a neurologist and brain specialist at hand, Dr. Bruhling (Lawrence Grant). According to Dr. Bruhling, Craig is suffering from a paralyzed cerebral cortex. Furthermore, this state of Craig''s could make him dangerous to his surrounding. Dr. Bruhling concludes that this state, this paralyzation of a portion of the brain cells in the cerebral cortex, must have been induced by another person - this is not something that Craig possibly could have brought on himself. Nick continues his investigation by hearing several of the family members, and finds out that if Craig dies, his daughter Tina will inherit everything he owns. It doesn''t take many moments however, until Craig actually become violent and seemingly kills his brother-in-law. When Nick is to meet George, to question him, in the estate garden, he finds the man murdered with a knife in his back, and Craig standing by the dead body in the estate garden.
But is the cataleptic banker actually a killer or is someone even more dangerous behind the murder? Nick gets a list of false clues, that point to Wallace as the killer. Craig, who is deemed capable of very violent behaviour in his current state, tries to kill Nick, but fails. Nick continues to investigate, and after getting some additional information from Dr. Bruhling he traces a piece of laboratory equipment that might have been used to alter Craig''s brain cells. The trail leads Nick and Billie - who now work together, smittened - to an abandoned nearby shack on the estate where strange experiments have recently been conducted by a man named Carson. The pair go to the shack on a stormy night to search the place. At first they find nothing in particular, but are nearly shot by an unseen assailant. Just before they leave the place, they discover another man who appears to be in the same state as Craig. Nick goes on to see the realtor in charge of the lease of the property, Homer Hawkins. The realtor claims he hasn''t had any contact with Carson - the tenant - since he signed the contract, and even then they only spoke on the phone.
With this new information Nick decides on an ingenious plan: to find the killer by recording everyone''s voices on tape, and letting Homer Hawkins listen to them one by one. This way Hawkins will be able to identify him. Later in the night, there are two attempts to kill Nick - one by Tony and one by Helen - and he finally calls the police to have them arrested. When they are safely behind bars he explains the two culprits'' motives: Tony and Helen are lovers and were found out by Craig. Tony knew about Tina inheriting everything from Craig, so he went to hire the abandoned shack in the name of Carson, play doctor and place Craig in that zombie state he is in. That way Helen would be able to manage Craig''s estate, ensuring that it didn''t fall into Tina''s hands. George was killed because he witnessed Tony bringing back Craig to the house after the brain treatment. Nick is ultimately paid $25,000 by Tina for his sleuthing, and he and his new found love Billie elope together to get married.','["William Beaudine"]','["Howard Dimsdale","Joseph Hoffman"]','["James Dunn","Joan Woodbury","Paul McVey"]','["Horror","Mystery","Thriller"]','5.4','["tt0033760","tt0037151","tt0039912","tt0040472","tt0024382","tt0040068","tt0024538","tt0020492","tt0027501","tt0037100","tt0049621","tt0020668"]','["poverty row;mystery;James Dunn"]','[{"url":"/Living_Ghost.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Living_Ghost_movie_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','Living_Ghost_movie',5945,'Q7747853','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

He has ordered his crew to bail out, without revealing that his own parachute has been shot up. He manages to contact June, an American radio operator based in England and talks with her for a few minutes before jumping without a parachute.
Peter should have died at that point, but Conductor 71, the guide sent to escort him to the Other World, misses him in the thick fog over the English Channel. The airman wakes up on a beach near June''s base. At first, he assumes he is in the afterlife but, when a de Havilland Mosquito flies low overhead, discovers to his bewilderment that he is still alive.
Peter meets June cycling back to her quarters after her night shift, and they fall in love. Conductor 71 (a French aristocrat guillotined in the Revolution) stops time to explain the situation, urging Peter to accept his death and accompany him to the Other World, but Peter demands an appeal. While Conductor 71 consults his superiors, Peter continues to live. Conductor 71 returns and informs him that he has been granted his appeal and has three days to prepare his case. He can choose a defence counsel from among all the people who have ever died, but he has difficulty picking one.
Peter''s visions are diagnosed by June''s fascinated friend Doctor Reeves as a symptom of a brain injury—chronic adhesive arachnoiditis from a slight concussion two years earlier—and he is scheduled for surgery. Reeves is killed in a motorcycle accident while trying to find the ambulance that is to take Peter to the hospital. Reeves'' death allows him to act as Peter''s counsel.
Reeves argues that, through no fault of his own, his client was given additional time on Earth and that, during that time, he has fallen in love and now has an earthly commitment that should take precedence over the afterlife''s claim on him. The matter comes to a head—in parallel with Peter''s brain surgery—before a celestial court; the camera zooms out from an amphitheatre to reveal that it is as large as a spiral galaxy. The prosecutor is American Abraham Farlan, who hates the British for making him the first casualty of the American Revolutionary War. Reeves challenges the composition of the jury, which is made up of representatives who are prejudiced against the British. In fairness, the jury is replaced by a multicultural mixture of modern Americans whose origins are as varied as those they replace.
Reeves and Farlan both cite examples from British and world history to support their positions. In the end, Reeves has June take the stand (Conductor 71 makes her fall asleep in the real world so she can testify) and prove that she genuinely loves Peter by telling her that the only way to save his life is to take his place, whereupon she steps onto the stairway to the Other World without hesitation and is carried away, leaving Peter behind. The stairway comes to an abrupt halt and June rushes back to Peter''s open arms. As Reeves triumphantly explains, "... nothing is stronger than the law in the universe, but on Earth, nothing is stronger than love."
The jury rules in Peter''s favour. The Judge shows Reeves and Farlan the new lifespan granted to the defendant; Reeves calls it "very generous", and Farlan jokingly complains, then agrees to it. The two then engage in supportive banter with one another, and against the stern Chief Recorder, who protests against the breach of law. The scene then shifts to the operating room, where the surgeon declares the operation a success.',NULL,'["Michael Powell","Emeric Pressburger"]','["David Niven","Kim Hunter","Robert Coote"]','["Comedy","Drama","Fantasy","Romance","War"]','8.1','["tt0036112","tt0039192","tt0040725","tt0037800","tt0036695","tt0037558","tt0054167","tt0041546","tt0038574","tt0035446","tt0044103","tt0051036"]',NULL,'[{"url":"/Lbines-RetroVisionTheaterPresentsAMatterOfLifeAndDeath502_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/Lbines-RetroVisionTheaterPresentsAMatterOfLifeAndDeath502_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','Lbines-RetroVisionTheaterPresentsAMatterOfLifeAndDeath502',58064,'Q1546792','wp',NULL,'["Michael Powell","Emeric Pressburger"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Before they can kill him, the Botos then notice the arrival of a long-haired, topless wild woman (Marion Michael) wearing only three necklaces and a loincloth made of beads, shells, and some feathers. The wild woman communicates with the Botos to spare him and let him go. When Thoren leaves, the wild woman heads into her treehouse. Later that night, Thoren tells the others of his experience with the wild woman and is told by one of them to take him to where he saw her. The Botos are shown doing entertainment as the wild woman plays with her pet lion cub Simba.
The next day, the wild woman grabs onto a vine and swings over a lake before she lets go to drop into the lake and go swimming. When she is spotted by Thoren, she escapes into the jungle only to be later caught in a big game net by Kersten and Keller which is spotted by one of the tribesman who alerts the other Botos. Later that night, Thoren arrives and has part of the net removed from the woman''s head and feeds her a banana. When the Botos attack in retaliation, Thoren hooks up a tape to a loudspeaker which frightens off the Botos, as Dr. Jacqueline Goddard (Irène Galter) undoes the net and lets her rest. After the Botos escape, the wild woman gets up and is attacked by an expedition member, only for him to be beaten up by Thoren, who warns him to keep his hands off of her. Thoren carries her body back to the tent to let her rest. Thoren and Jacqueline then notice that one of necklaces around her neck has a good luck charm with an L engraved into it. Thoren then decides to bring it to Professor Danner to figure it out.
The next day, Jacqueline gives the wild woman a bath which she enjoys, cuts her unruly hair to shoulder length, and puts her in some new clothes. Thoren comes in and tells Jacqueline that the whole world is asking for information about the white girl that they found. Jacqueline says that her name is Kiyahi, but could not understand anything else that she said. Thoren and Jacqueline then teach her some of their language and states that she must have originally come from a good family before being taken in by the Botos.
Meanwhile, in Germany, shipping tychoon Theo Amelongen (Rudolf Forster) and his nephew Viktor (Reggie Nalder) look at the article about the wild woman that was found and Theo suspects that it might be her long-lost granddaughter Liane, who went missing 18 years ago when the ship she and her parents were on went down, with a speculation that her Liane at 2 years old had somehow survived. Theo decides to have his agents look into this.
Back in Africa, Thoren takes Liane with him and Jacqueline. When Liane''s tribesman friend Tanga (Jean Pierre Faye) and Simba show up, he ends up sneaking on the ship. While Liane, Thoren, and Jacqueline are playing cards, Tanga catches up with them and they end up taking him and the lion cub with them. When the ship arrives in Germany, the press swarm over Liana until Thoren sends then off.
When the group ends up at Theo''s house, he is reintroduced to Liane as well as being introduced to Tanga and Simba. Viktor is told by his lawyer that Liane will be inheriting the fortune. This causes Viktor to take matters into his old hands without Theo finding out. He ends up locking her into a room and ends up getting attacked by Tanga. At his company later, Viktor hires a man named Jensen who was one of the survivors of the ship Imperia sinking and asks to testify that he had no survivors without mentioning that Viktor hired him for this.
While talking with Thoren as a bikini-clad Liane plays with Simba, Theo tells Thoren that he will watch over Liane until he gets back. They then see Liane climb up a tree and dive into the lake that she swims in until breakfast is served. Theo then commented that she had inherited her mother''s swimming abilities. Theo and Thoren then look at the last letter Liane''s mother wrote, which says that she had given her milk to her fox terrier Terry and enjoys climbing. Later on, Blackie the dog finds a piece of paper of the letter that was crumpled up. When Thoren asks who would want to try to dispose of the letter, Theo asks his maid where Viktor is. Theo then arranges to meet with Viktor tonight. When the counselor arrives with Viktor, they find Theo dead in his study. Moments later, the police are called in where the counselor and the maid are questioned about Theo''s death. They found the evidence of the pencil and string, which the inspector thinks that the culprit would end up getting into the study. It is then discovered that Viktor was responsible for his uncle''s death as he makes his escape. Viktor then gets into his car as Thoren and the police pursue him. The car chase goes down the street until Viktor ends up driving off the bridge to his death.
Back in Africa, Professor Danner gets the news that Liane has inherited the Amelongen fortune and gets a news article that Liane is heading back to Africa to visit the Danner expedition. Professor Danner considers this as a homecoming with Thoren and Tanga arriving with her. The Botos also rejoice with the news that Liane and Tanga are coming back. Liane, Tanga, and Thoren arrive with Professor Danner. While the Botos celebrate, Liane runs off into the jungle, gets naked, and goes swimming in a lake. She is then joined by Thoren.','["Eduard von Borsody"]','["Anne Day-Helveg","Thomas Fough"]','["Marion Michael","Hardy Krüger","Irene Galter"]','["Adventure"]','5.2','["tt0073485","tt0050637","tt0065070","tt0057351","tt0168687","tt0082758","tt0178543","tt6286072","tt0058285","tt0122587","tt0083520","tt0290082"]','["Action; Adventure; Jungle"]','[{"url":"/laine_jungle_godess.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/laine_jungle_godess_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/liane_jungle_goddess_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','liane_jungle_goddess',42649,'Q318031','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

('tt0058700','free','The Last Man on Earth (1964)','1964','1h 26min','In the year 1968, every day is the same for Dr. Robert Morgan (Price): he wakes up, gathers his weapons, and then goes hunting for vampires. Morgan lives in a world where everyone else has been infected by a plague that has turned them into undead, vampiric creatures that cannot stand sunlight, fear mirrors, and are repelled by garlic. They would kill Morgan if they could, but they are weak and unintelligent. At night, Morgan locks himself inside his house; during the day, he kills as many vampires as he can, burning the bodies.
A flashback sequence explains that, three years before, Morgan''s wife and daughter had succumbed to the plague, before it was widely known by the public that the dead would return to life. Instead of taking his wife to the same public burn pit used to dispose of his daughter''s corpse, Morgan buried her without the knowledge of the authorities. When his wife returned to his home and attacked him, Morgan became aware of the need to kill the plague victims with a wooden stake. Morgan hypothesizes that he is immune to the bacteria because he was bitten by an infected vampire bat when he was stationed in Panama, which introduced a diluted form of the plague into his blood.
One day, a dog appears in the neighborhood. Desperate for companionship, Morgan chases after the dog but does not catch it. Sometime later the dog appears, wounded, at Morgan''s doorstep. He takes the dog into his home and treats its wounds, looking forward to having company for the first time in three years. He quickly discovers, however, that it, too, has become infected with the plague. Morgan is later seen burying the dog, which he has impaled with a wooden stake.
After burying the dog, Morgan spots a woman in the distance. The woman, Ruth, is terrified of Morgan at first sight and runs from him. Morgan convinces her to return to his home but is suspicious of her true nature. Ruth becomes ill when Morgan waves garlic in her face but claims that she has a weak stomach.
Morgan''s suspicion that Ruth is infected is confirmed when he discovers her attempting to inject herself with a combination of blood and vaccine that holds the disease at bay. Ruth initially draws a gun on Morgan but ultimately surrenders it to him. Ruth then tells him that she is part of a group of people like her — infected but under treatment — and was sent to spy on Morgan. The vaccine allows the people to function normally with the drug in the bloodstream, but once it wears off, the infection takes over the body again. Ruth explains that her people are planning to rebuild society as they destroy the remaining vampires, and that many of the vampires Morgan killed were technically still alive. Ruth desperately urges Morgan to flee, but he inexplicably refuses.
While Ruth is asleep, Morgan transfuses his own blood into her. She is immediately cured, and Morgan sees hope that, together, they can cure the rest of her people. Moments later, however, Ruth''s people attack. Morgan takes the gun and flees his home while the attackers kill the vampires gathered around Morgan''s home.
Ruth''s people spot Morgan and chase him. He exchanges gunfire with them and picks up tear gas grenades from a police station armory along the way. While the tear gas delays his pursuers somewhat, Morgan is wounded by gunfire and retreats into a church. Despite Ruth''s protests to let Morgan live, his pursuers finally impale him on the altar with a spear. With his dying breaths, Morgan denounces his pursuers as "freaks" and declares that he is the last true man on Earth.',NULL,'["Richard Matheson","William F.

The prince soon emerges as a cruel, treacherous tyrant. Goaded on by Sir Guy, he usurps Richard''s throne. When Huntingdon receives a message from Lady Marian Fitzwalter, his love interest, telling him of all that has transpired, he requests permission to return to England. King Richard assumes that the Earl has turned coward and denies him permission. The Earl seeks to leave in spite of this, but is ambushed by Sir Guy and imprisoned as a deserter. Upon escaping from his confines, he returns to England, endangering his life and honor, to oppose Prince John and restore King Richard''s throne. He finds himself and his friends outlawed and Marian apparently dead.
Huntingdon returns to Nottingham and adopts the name of Robin Hood, acrobatic champion of the oppressed. Leading a band that steals from the rich to give to the poor, including Friar Tuck, Little John, Will Scarlet, and Alan-a-Dale, he labors to set things right through swashbuckling feats and makes life miserable for Prince John and his cohort, the High Sheriff of Nottingham.

She takes an American Airlines training course and passes. Her first flight is nearly her last when, after inadvertently offending the pilot, Mike Jamison, she forgets the passengers'' food. Mike''s intervention earns Marcy a second chance.
Marcy''s home base is moved to Los Angeles and she finds an apartment with one friend from stewardess school. She meets a passenger, Mike Lawrence, who is a graduate research student in science, then also nearly loses her job again by permitting a young passenger to keep her dog in the cabin, against the airline''s rules. Marcy is suspended for a week.
When a man named Mike Tracy helps give her stalled car a push, Marcy learns that he works for a Chicago advertising agency. An idea of hers, to let stewardesses endorse soap, pleases Tracy''s client, and soon Marcy is invited by a photographer to pose for magazine ads herself. 
When all three show up to help Marcy move into her new bungalow she is now sharing with three of her friends from stewardess training, she tries to keep the Mikes straight. Marcy names her male companions, Mike for Mike Tracey, Mikey for Mike Lawrence and Michael for Mike Jamison. All of them are jealous of each other and vie for Marcy''s attention. 
During a party later at her bungalow, Marcy is called away when her photographer requests one more picture to send out with the rest of the ad campaign for approval. Marcy finds herself dressed in a very short sarong, totally unlike the regulation company uniform in which all the other pictures were taken. The photographer also is only interested in fixing her a drink and having her relax on the cushion placed on the floor which is part of the props. She objects strenuously, but he is not hearing her. 
The three Mikes arrive in time to start a brawl, which makes the newspapers and gets both Marcy and her pilot friend suspended from their jobs, as well as costing Mikey his account. Mike''s job as a graduate research student and consideration for a special fellowship award for an outstanding scientist, is in jeopardy. The award would get him a teaching position at the college, and allow him to continue his research there as well. 
Marcy goes to the superiors of all three men personally to plead for their reinstatement. After she is successful, all three Mikes propose marriage to her. Not positive what to do, Marcy reacts favorably to Mike Lawrence''s "I love you," and the other two Mikes concede that he is the guy for her.','["Charles Walters"]','["Sidney Sheldon","Ruth Brooks Flippen"]','["Jane Wyman","Van Johnson","Howard Keel"]','["Comedy","Romance"]','6.2','["tt0038716","tt0044072","tt0043633","tt0042369","tt0037786","tt0040887","tt1772240","tt0028010","tt0043350","tt0044855","tt0042829","tt0043371"]','["Jane Wyman; Van Johnson; Howard Keel; Barry Sullivan; Phyllis Kirk; Anne Sargent; Jeff Donnell; Herbert Heyes; Robert Sherwood; Don McGuire; Barbara Billingsley; Hugh Sanders; John Maxwell; Lewis Martin; Ethel Welles; Mystic Nights Videos"]','[{"url":"/ThreeGuysNamedMike1951.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/ThreeGuysNamedMike1951_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/ThreeGuysNamedMike1951_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','ThreeGuysNamedMike1951',24662,'Q3829187','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Suddenly, he spots a group of nefarious pirates and their captain singing a shanty. He rallies his crew for retreat, but the pirates discover them and plan to steal their treasure. First they shoot their cannons at them, but Sinbad bats their cannonballs back and destroys them. Then their captain catches their ship with an anchor and the two crews engage each other in battle while their captains and their parrots duel it out. The pirate captain finds himself outnumbered, but then he uses a cannonball as a bowling ball to defeat Sinbad''s crew. The sailor is tied up and forced to walk the plank into the ocean. 
Luckily, Sinbad''s parrot saves him before he drowns and he manages to swim ashore to a deserted island, where he hallucinates dancing hula girls. He then finds the same pirates planning to bury the treasure on the island and tricks them into fighting each other by throwing coconuts at their heads from atop a tree, but is thrown off by an angry ape and discovered. They tie him to a tree and torment him until realizing that the tree was actually the leg of a giant, fire-breathing Roc, who overpowers the pirates. The captain retaliates by throwing the treasure chest at it, but the Roc catches it in its beak and flies away with Sinbad still attached. Sinbad''s parrot unties him and forces the Roc to drop the treasure by destroying its tail-feathers. Sinbad activates a parachute in his hat and lands safely on his own ship with the treasure.

The school''s more capitalist elements, such as aiming for high bourgeois academic standards, and refusal to admit poorly-educated (according to bourgeois standards) peasants clash with Long''s more communistic approach. He advocates only admitting students from the working class, and begins innovative changes—to the dismay of many other staff—such as putting more emphasis on hard labor than classroom learning, switching courses to accommodate experiential learning, removing impractical sections from the curriculum, holding lessons in the field, and excusing students who miss exams to work for the commune. Later, a student Li Jinfeng (Wang Suya), whom Long considers an exemplary follower of the "educational revolution", faces expulsion and is put on trial. The masses come out in support of her and denounce those taking the capitalist line on education. Those in power taking the capitalist line decide to shut down the college as a result.

Once at the ranch, Gehrig encounters a protection racket preying on the ranchers by extortion and violence. He teams up with a crusading local attorney to fight the crooks and ultimately put them in jail.
In the opening scene, Lou Gehrig is surrounded by a group of reporters at Grand Central Terminal in New York City, where he is about to take a train to his sister''s ranch out west in Rawhide. Proclaiming that he is "through with baseball", he tells the sceptical newsmen that he wants the "peace and quiet" of the cowboy life.Gehrig plays an easygoing dude rancher, whose self-deprecating humor is displayed the first time he attempts to ride a horse. As he timidly approaches his steed, a ranch hand urges, "Jus'' walk right up to him like ya'' wasn''t afraid", to which Gehrig deadpans, "I couldn''t be that deceitful".An unscrupulous interloper, Ed Saunders, and his henchmen have seized control of the local "Ranchers Protective Association" by subterfuge and are using it as a front to extort outrageous "association fees" from the local ranchers, resorting to violence and bribery. After Gehrig refuses to pay, one of his ranch hands is shot by one of the crooks. Gehrig storms into the local saloon to confront Saunders and his gang. When a barroom brawl ensues, the attorney (played by co-star Smith Ballew) joins in the fight as Gehrig hurls billiard balls at the criminals. The movie eventually reaches a climax in the obligatory western film chase scene when Gehrig and the other ranchers form a posse to chase the fleeing Saunders gang and put them in jail.
The film has several musical interludes. Ballew sings When a Cowboy Goes to Town by Albert von Tilzer (who also composed the familiar Take Me Out to the Ball Game).

One reason may have been to avoid "de-mystifying" Wessel.  Part of the problem was that authentic depiction of Stormtroopers, including picking fights with Communists, did not fit the more reasonable tone the Nazis adopted while in power, and would undermine Volksgemeinschaft; the fictionalized Westmar, unlike Wessel, does not alienate his family.  It was, however, among the first films to depict dying for Hitler as a glorious death for Germany, resulting in his spirit inspiring his comrades.  His decision to go to the streets is presented as fighting "the real battle."

When Idar and Rhia, a young couple of the tribe come across a water monster, the monster is killed by Maciste with a spear. The two ask Maciste to join their tribe but Maciste explains he has a destiny to fulfill of righting wrongs and must leave.
Soon afterwards a cave dwelling tribe of moon worshippers led by Fuwan attack the village and carry off the sun worshipper''s women. Maciste returns to the sun worshippers and enter the moon worshipper''s underground city through a river.  There he discovers Moah, whose father and brother who had formerly led the tribe were murdered by Fuwan and wishes to take Moah.

Maciste passes through an underwater tunnel, defeats the three headed hydra that lives there and is able to eliminate the guards to the entrance and remove the stone gate to the entrance letting the vengeful sun worshippers in. The women are freed but Maciste destroys their path to the surface once they have left and is captured by the moon worshippers who bury him, and later Moah in the earth so the worms may eat their bodies.

This film "is a very faithful adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen''s 1846 fable (which is brief enough to suggest that the original could have been read aloud during screenings) and, instead of the other films'' scrupulously realistic presentation, Williamson here resorts to numerous special effects, mostly in the form of superimpositions." "However, these are entirely true to the spirit of the original story, whose dramatic and emotional centerpiece is the series of visions seen by the little match seller when striking matches to keep warm," and the film, "is as ambitious and innovative as A Reservist."

In addition to containing the explosives formula, the idol also holds a fortune in jewels.
Tarzan, Ula and Major Martling locate the lost city containing the idol and rescue D''Arnot from the natives that worship it in the 70-minute-long first episode. However, Raglan escapes with the Green Goddess and heads through the jungle for the coast. Tarzan and the others pursue him across the jungle, encountering many perils, including recapture by the natives to whom the idol belonged. The adventures end out at sea where, during a hurricane, they are able to permanently secure the idol while Raglan is killed by another of Powers'' agents because of his failures.

On 30 May 1431, Joan is interrogated by the French clerical court. Her judges try to make her say something that will discredit her claim or shake her belief that she has been given a mission by God to drive the English from France, but she remains steadfast. One or two of them, believing that she is indeed a saint, support her. The authorities then resort to deception. A priest reads a false letter to the illiterate prisoner supposedly from King Charles VII of France, telling her to trust in the bearer. When that too fails, Joan is taken to view the torture chamber, but the sight, though it causes her to faint, does not intimidate her.
When she is threatened with burning at the stake, she finally breaks and allows a priest to guide her hand in signing a confession. However, the judge then condemns her to life imprisonment. As the jailer shaves her head, she realises she has been unfaithful to God. She demands that the judges return and she recants her confession.
As more and more around her begin to recognise her true faith and calling, she is permitted a final communion mass. She is then dressed in sack-cloth and taken to the place of execution. She helps the executioner tie her bonds. The crowds gather and the fire is lit. As the flames rise, the women weep and a man cries out, "vous avez brûlé une sainte" ("you have burned a saint"). The troops prepare for a riot. As the flames consume Joan, the troops and crowd clash and people are killed. Joan is consumed by the flames, but they protect her soul as it rises to heaven.','["Carl Theodor Dreyer"]','["Joseph Delteil","Carl Theodor Dreyer"]','["Maria Falconetti","Eugene Silvain","André Berley"]','["Biography","Drama","History"]','8.2','["tt0018455","tt0015324","tt0015648","tt0046438","tt0017925","tt0060107","tt0010323","tt0048452","tt0053198","tt0046268","tt0023649","tt0060827"]','["Carl Theodor Dreyer; The Passion of Joan of Arc; Joan of Arc"]','[{"url":"/DreyersThePassionOfJoanOfArc_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/The.passion.of.joan.of.arc.mp4","format":"h.264"}]','DreyersThePassionOfJoanOfArc',69081,'Q51520','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The adults take in the quintet of twisted youths, oblivious to the kids'' dark secret, until an electrical blackout renders the telephones inoperable. An insidious game of cat and mouse ensues, with bizarre mishaps claiming the lives of one grownup after another. More and more adults meet with shocking and gruesome deaths. A handful of survivors finally suspect their prepubescent houseguests of being demented and violent murderers, but the latter prove too resourceful and cunning for their hosts.

Cabiria is a 1914 silent movie from the early years of Italy''s movie industry, directed by Giovanni Pastrone (1883-1959). The movie is set in ancient Sicily and Carthage during the period of the Second Punic War (218-202 BC). It follows a melodramatic main plot about an abducted little girl, Cabiria, and features an eruption of Mt. Etna, heinous religious rituals in Carthage, the alpine trek of Hannibal, Archimedes'' defeat of the Roman fleet at the Siege of Syracuse and Scipio in North Africa. Apart from being a classic on its own terms, the film is also notable for being the first film in which the long-running film character Maciste makes his debut. According to Martin Scorsese, in this work Pastrone invented the epic movie and deserves credit for many of the innovations often credited to D.W. Griffith and Cecil B. DeMille. Among those were the first use of the moving camera, thus freeing the narrative film from "static gaze".

Investigating this dual homicide are police detectives Mike Leary and John Koch, who interview the drive-in''s boorish manager, Austin Johnson, and the odd custodian, Germy. Germy mentions that a peeping tom likes to cruise the area to watch couples and lone girls, and he is told to try and write down the voyeur''s license plate number the next time he sees him.
That night, the killer strikes again, impaling two lovers while they are making out in their vehicle, and leaving a sword behind. To see if the sword belongs to the missing drive-in owner, Germy is brought in to the police station identify it. Germy states that the sword is not a part of the owner''s private collection, and tells the detectives that the voyeur was at the drive-in around the time of the latest double murder, and that he managed to write down the man''s license plate number. The plate number is connected to Orville Ingleson, whose home the detectives visit. Orville denies any connection to the deaths, but when a bloody cloth is found in his car, he panics, and tries to make a run for it. Orville is caught, and claims the blood was just from a dog he accidentally ran over, which is confirmed by further analysis, forcing the police to let him go.
That evening, the detectives (one of them disguised as a woman) go to a screening at the drive-in, and spot Orville there, even though he had promised to stay away from it. After a customer who had stormed off when his girlfriend refused his advances returns to his car, he discovers that his girlfriend has been beheaded. Leary and Koch rush to Orville''s car, and find him dead from a slit throat. Austin and Germy are brought in the station for questioning, and Austin antagonizes the detectives, refusing to close the drive-in without a court order, and firing Germy.
The following evening, Leary and Koch get a call about a machete-wielding man who has just murdered two people being cornered in a warehouse, with a little girl he has taken hostage. The detectives go to the warehouse, and after a chase and stand off, shoot the man dead, learning afterward that he was a mental patient who had escaped only a few hours ago, and thus he cannot be the serial killer.
At the drive-in, Germy collects his things, and goes to the projection booth to confront Austin about which one of them gets to keep the owner''s sword collection, and about money he is owed. As soon as Germy enters the booth, the silhouette of Austin being killed with a sword is projected onto the drive-in''s screen while a Wild West movie is being featured. Leary and Koch (who want to talk to Austin) arrive just in time to see this, and break into the booth, where they find both Austin and Germy hacked to pieces and the killer gone with no trace.
The film suddenly comes to an abrupt end where an on-screen text states that other drive-ins throughout the country are now being plagued by similar bloodbaths, and that the killer''s identity is still unknown. A fake public address then announces that a psychopath is loose in the viewer''s own drive-in theater, and urges the audience not to panic, as the police are on their way.','["Stu Segall"]','["John F.

Paul tells his best friend, the schoolteacher Truson (=true son), also played by Johnson, but Truson is skeptical.
The town of Hamelin has entered a competition in order to win a banner from the King. To this end, the Mayor (Claude Rains) exhorts the people to work incessantly, even the children, to the extent that they are denied school and play. Truson protests, but his protests go unheeded by the arrogant Mayor. As part of a competition between several villages, the Mayor and his cabinet plan to construct golden chimes to impress the King''s Emissary, who is due to pay a visit to Hamelin. But their efforts are temporarily halted when the town is invaded by rats, which have fled the neighboring city of Hamelout after the Weser River flooded and destroyed the town.
It is then that the Piper magically appears before the Mayor and his councilors. (He can appear inside the council room although the door is bolted.) Asking to be paid all the money in the town''s treasury, (fifty-thousand guilders)  he offers to rid the town of the rats. An unusual element is introduced into the story here: whenever the Piper plays a happy tune for the children, only Truson and the children can hear it. When he plays "In the Hall of the Mountain King" and leads the rats to their doom in the river, the children quickly fall asleep and only the material-minded adults such as the Mayor, but not Truson, can hear the music.
The Piper rids the town of the rats, but rather than simply paying him, the Mayor and his Cabinet attempt to use legal pettifoggery to trick him into an agreement whereby he must deposit a certain amount of money as a guarantee that the rats will not return, and if they do he must return the rest of the money that he has been paid. Furious, the Piper leaves without his money, and the Mayor plots to use the gold to construct the chimes. Truson, who is in love with the Mayor''s daughter Mara (Lori Nelson) is thrown in jail for speaking out against this injustice. The Mayor plans to marry off Mara to the King''s Emissary (Jim Backus), but at this point, the Piper takes his revenge. Playing a happy variation on "In the Hall of the Mountain King", he leads the children of Hamelin away and into a beautiful kingdom concealed by a cave which magically opens to let the children in. But Paul is accidentally left behind, after he falls while trying to catch up with the other children and the cave closes before he can pass through.
The rest of the plot concerns the resolution of the Truson-Mara love story, the attempts of the adults to bring back the children, and the townsfolk and the Mayor.  A happy ending showing the Piper''s forgiveness and his returning of the children was added to the story in order to keep the program a family special.','["Bretaigne Windust"]','["Robert Browning","Hal Stanley"]','["Van Johnson","Claude Rains","Lori Nelson"]','["Musical","Family","Fantasy"]','5.8','["tt0028118","tt0044762","tt0051936","tt0066194","tt0042524","tt0061743","tt0023753","tt0029440","tt0057523","tt0034928","tt0031580","tt0027421"]','["fantasy;musical;fairy tale"]','[{"url":"/The_Pied_Piper_of_Hamelin_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/pied.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/pied_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','The_Pied_Piper_of_Hamelin',900766,'Q7757075','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

As they near Donald Duck''s house, Donald is heiling to the song in his sleep. His alarm clock, with all the numbers replaced with swastikas, goes off and he smashes it. His cuckoo clock with a bird that is dressed up as Hitler heils as a clock chime, only for Donald to throw a shoe at it. Passing by Donald Duck''s house (the features of which depict Adolf Hitler), the band members poke him out of bed with a bayonet to get him ready for work. Here Donald then faces and "Heils" the portraits of the Führer (Hitler), the Emperor (Hirohito) and Il Duce (Mussolini) respectively, then goes to make breakfast.
Because of wartime rationing, Donald''s breakfast consists of bread that is so stale and hard it resembles wood (and must be sliced using a saw), coffee brewed from a single hoarded coffee bean, and a bacon and egg-flavored breath spray. The band shoves a copy of Mein Kampf in front of him for a moment of reading, then marches into his house and escorts him to a factory, with Donald now carrying the bass drum and Göring kicking him.

Upon arriving at the factory (at bayonet-point), Donald starts his comical 48-hour daily shift of screwing caps onto artillery shells coming at him in an assembly line. Mixed in with the shells are portraits of the Führer, so Donald must perform the Hitler salute every time a portrait appears, all the while screwing the caps onto shells, much to his disgust. Each new batch of shells is of a different size, ranging from individual bullets to massive shells as large as Donald (if not larger). The pace of the assembly line intensifies (as in the Charlie Chaplin comedy Modern Times), and Donald finds it increasingly hard to complete all the tasks. At the same time, he is bombarded with propaganda messages about the superiority of the Aryan race and the glory of working for the Führer.
After a "paid vacation" that consists of making swastika shapes with his body for a few seconds in front of a painted backdrop of the Alps as exercise, Donald is ordered to work overtime. He has a nervous breakdown with hallucinations of artillery shells everywhere, some of which are snakes and birds, some sing and are the same shape of the marching band from the start, music and all (some of the animation from this sequence is recycled from the "Pink Elephants on Parade" sequence from Dumbo).
When the hallucinations clear, Donald finds himself in his bed, and realizes that the whole experience was a nightmare; however, he sees the shadow of a figure holding its right hand up in the form of a Nazi salute. He begins to do so himself until he realizes that it is the shadow of a miniature Statue of Liberty, holding her torch high in her right hand. Remembering he is in the United States, Donald embraces the statue, grateful of his U.S. citizenship.

Hearing shots, Dare (Wayne) "This is no time to think" in a tall white hat, and hungry dark-mustached wiry side-kick lightning-rod salesman Dink Hooley (an uncredited Syd Saylor) mis-call "the winning side", add their wild mustangs to confusion and dusty stampede at jerky triple time of original silent film. Rough shrubby terrain provides a dangerous battleground. 
Seemingly safe across border in next state, Wayne''s cousin Tom Fillmore (John Mack Brown), local "big man," Bank President, and "shining" good sheep of the family surprises the pair, and offers them a job. "People around here spend too much time thinking"; John just fist fights and proposes while Tom''s girl Judy (Marsha Hunt) bandages his eye, "I guess I''ll just marry you" he says. She declines to answer, but says, "You''ve been hurt enough for one day."  When a rattler scares her horse, Tom''s somersaults and Dare wins the chase.  
"I wound up the cat and kicked the clock out" is Dare trying to turn a new leaf and be responsible. Judy asks Tom to take the cook''s apron off Wayne, so the boss does promote his cousin to foreman of the herding. First night out, rustlers attack - empty blankets "Hope it don''t start raining". Dare makes the sale for over $10K, but gets convinced to pay out wages and stay the night to celebrate, proving who is "the best player west of the Mississippi". The bartender serves a deck under the bad guy''s tray of drinks, and Dare  loses almost everything.
When Dare is late returning, Tom tells Judy the cost was worth every penny to show her Dare''s true nature. She pleads for him to save Dare "You''re smart about these things,  smarter than any man I know." He arrives in time to take over playing and catches their trick. Fillmore hands have already left, so the bad guys shoot Tom in the shoulder and pursue the trio. Dink diverts some and catches up to bring the hands back, while the cousins hole up, Dare admitting Tom is the best poker player. Back home after winning the gunfight, Tom tells Judy where Dare is riding out of town, and that he wants to offer him a partnership, so Judy brings the Montana-bound buddies back.','["Charles Barton"]','["Stuart Anthony","Robert Yost"]','["John Wayne","Marsha Hunt","Johnny Mack Brown"]','["Romance","Western"]','5.7','["tt0025455","tt0039152","tt0028510","tt0026273","tt0025373","tt0025440","tt0025830","tt0026267","tt0024516","tt0025699","tt0024902","tt0026846"]','["Romance; Western; John Wayne"]','[{"url":"/Hell_Town.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Hell_Town_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/Hell_Town_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','Hell_Town',120347,'Q1056792','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The film material shows how the archaeological team discovered the long sought ancient tomb of an Emperor of the Ming dynasty.
In the tomb, the team found a scroll, telling of a secret Temple of Eternal Fire. The temple is believed to be hiding a previously unknown oil reserve, and would be of great financial importance to the Chinese people were it to be discovered.
During the expedition, when the tomb was opened, a forceful hurricane took the life of Mason, the co-pilot. The storm was predicted by an ancient curse guarding the tomb. Unfortunately, as Benton is about to reveal the contents of the scroll during the presentation, he starts choking and ultimately dies from suffocation.
After the presentation, it turns out that the scroll is missing from Benton''s safe in his office, and his secretary, Win Len, claims she has no knowledge of its whereabouts. One of Benton''s students, James Lee Wong, does his own investigation into the death of his professor, and finds out that Benton must have been poisoned with what another man, Street, identifies as an oriental vegetable poison. James finds a pitcher and a glass cup containing traces of this poison. 
Another member of the expedition team, camera man Charles Fraser, is attacked in his home, and is found injured by James and Street. They also find Win Len tied up and gagged at the house, having been attacked after entering the house. They are both unaware of that Mason faked his own death at the tomb, and that he and Benton''s butler, Jonas, are planning to lay their hands on all artifacts found in the tomb.
Street manages to trace Fraser''s attacker to a hideout near the waterfront, where both Mason and Jonas are hiding. Mason escapes through a secret door, but James and Street find an artifact identifiable from the tomb. They also find Jonas'' dead body in a coffin, and it turns out he has been poisoned, then stabbed.
The two amateur sleuths manage to get an article published in the paper, saying Jonas is sick with yellow fever in a hospital, to lure the killer there. James wears a wire and impersonates Mason at the hospital. Mason himself turns up at the hospital, and also Fraser. James and Mason fight each other, but Street and the police interrupt them.
It turns out Fraser has worked together with Mason, but tried to double-cross him and break into Benton''s safe to steal the scroll. Fraser also killed Benton to keep the secret of the oil reserve to himself. He later killed Jonas.
The original scroll has now been destroyed by Fraser, but there is still a photo of it left. After Fraser is arrested, the photo is given to the Chinese government so that they can try to find the oil reserve.','["Phil Rosen"]','["George Waggner","Ralph Gilbert Bettison"]','["Keye Luke","Lotus Long","Grant Withers"]','["Action","Crime","Drama","Mystery","Romance"]','6.2','["tt0031704","tt0030473","tt0032404","tt0031680","tt0032457","tt0029660","tt0030470","tt0031676","tt0029648","tt0031147","tt0030469","tt0029984"]',NULL,'[{"url":"/phantom_of_chinatown.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/phantom_of_chinatown_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/phantom_of_chinatown_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','phantom_of_chinatown',14951,'Q7180611','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

A drug addict (the drug is never named, but heroin is strongly implied), Frankie became clean in prison. On the outside, he greets friends and acquaintances. Sparrow (Arnold Stang), who runs a con selling homeless dogs, clings to him like a young brother, but Schwiefka (Robert Strauss), whom Frankie used to deal for in his illegal card game, has more sinister reasons for welcoming him back, as does Louie (Darren McGavin), Machine''s former drug dealer.
Frankie returns home to his wife Zosh (Eleanor Parker), who is supposedly wheelchair-bound after a car crash some years earlier that was caused by Frankie driving drunk. Zosh is secretly fully recovered, but pretends to be unable to walk in order to keep making Frankie feel guilty so he will stay with her. Frankie comments on the whistle she wears around her neck, a device she used in Frankie''s absence to summon a neighbor, Vi (Doro Merande), when needed.  With Frankie home, Zosh smothers her husband in their small tenement apartment and hinders his attempt to make something of himself. He thinks he has what it takes to play drums for a big band. While calling to make an appointment, he bumps into an old flame, Molly (Kim Novak) who works in a local strip joint as a hostess and lives in the apartment below Frankie''s. Unlike Zosh, Molly encourages his dream of becoming a drummer.
Frankie soon gets himself a tryout and asks Sparrow to get him a new suit, but the suit is a stolen one and he ends up back in a cell at a local Chicago police precinct. Schwiefka offers to pay the bail. Frankie refuses, but soon changes his mind when the sight of a drug addict on the edge becomes too much for him. Now, to repay the debt, he must deal cards for Schwiefka again. Louie is trying to hook him on drugs again, and with no job and Zosh to please, pressure is building from all directions.
Soon Frankie succumbs and is back on drugs and dealing marathon all-night card games for Schwiefka. Molly sees he is using drugs again and runs away from him. He gets a tryout as a drummer, but spends 24 hours straight dealing a poker game. Desperately needing a fix, Frankie follows Louie home, attacks him, and ransacks his house, but cannot find his drug stash. At the audition, with withdrawal coming on, Frankie can''t keep the beat and ruins his chance of landing the drumming job. When Louie goes to see Zosh to try to find Frankie, Louie discovers that Zosh has been faking her paralysis and can walk. Zosh, scared of being found out, pushes Louie over the railing of the stairwell to his death, but things backfire when Frankie is sought for Louie''s murder.
Initially not realizing he is a suspect in Louie''s death, Frankie goes to Molly hoping to get money for a fix. After learning that Captain Bednar and the police are looking for him, Molly convinces Frankie that he must go cold turkey if he is to stand a chance with the police. Frankie agrees and is locked in Molly''s apartment where he goes through a grueling withdrawal to clear the drugs from his body. Finally clean again, he tells Zosh he is going to leave her, start anew and stand trial. In her desperation to keep Frankie from leaving her, Zosh once again gives herself away, standing up in front of Frankie and the police. She runs, but can get no farther than the outside balcony. Trapped, she blows the whistle and throws herself off the balcony to her death. A police ambulance then arrives to remove Zosh''s lifeless body and drives away, while Frankie watches in dismay. He then walks away, with Molly following as Sparrow can be seen walking away in the opposite direction.','["Otto Preminger"]','["Walter Newman","Lewis Meltzer"]','["Frank Sinatra","Kim Novak","Eleanor Parker"]','["Crime","Drama","Film-Noir","Romance"]','7.4','["tt0052218","tt0055728","tt0047542","tt0050569","tt0044357","tt0046828","tt0043132","tt0037691","tt0045555","tt0050815","tt0047956","tt0049384"]','["Noir","Drama","Durgs","Gambeling","deciept"]','[{"url":"/The.Man.With.the.Golden.Arm.1955.720p.WEB-DL.AAC2.0.H.264-CtrlHD.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/The.Man.With.the.Golden.Arm.1955.720p.WEBDL.AAC2.0.H.264CtrlHD_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','The.Man.With.the.Golden.Arm.1955.720p.WEBDL.AAC2.0.H.264CtrlHD',5141,'Q1195631','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

He is rescued from a robbery attempt by a complete stranger, Ballin Mundson (George Macready). Mundson tells him about an illegal high-class casino, but warns him not to practice his cheating skills there. Farrell ignores his advice, cheats at blackjack, and is taken by two men to see the casino''s owner, who turns out to be Mundson. Farrell talks Mundson into hiring him as a bodyguard and quickly gains his confidence.
Mundson returns from a trip and announces he has a new wife, Gilda (Rita Hayworth), whom he has married after only knowing her for a day. Johnny and Gilda instantly recognize each other, though both deny it when Mundson questions them. Mundson assigns Farrell to watch over Gilda. Johnny and Gilda are consumed with hatred for each other, and she cavorts with men at all hours in increasingly more blatant efforts to enrage Johnny, and in return he grows more abusive and spiteful towards her.
Mundson is visited by two German mobsters. Their organization has financed a tungsten cartel, with everything put in Mundson''s name in order to hide their connection to it. They have decided that it is safe to take over the cartel now World War II has ended, but Mundson refuses to transfer ownership. The Argentine police are suspicious of the Germans and deploy agent Obregon (Joseph Calleia) to try and obtain information from Farrell, but he is oblivious about this aspect of Mundson''s operations. The Germans return to the casino during a carnival celebration, and Mundson ends up killing one of them. 
Farrell rushes to take Gilda to safety and alone in Mundson''s house, they have another confrontation and after declaring their undying hatred for each other, passionately kiss. After hearing the front door slam, they realise Mundson has overheard and a guilt ridden Farrell pursues him to a waiting private airplane. The plane explodes in midair and plummets into the ocean and Farrell concludes that Mundson has committed suicide.
Gilda inherits his estate. Farrell and she immediately marry, but unknown to her, Johnny is marrying her to punish her betrayal of Mundson. He abandons her but has her followed day and night by his men to torment her. Gilda tries to escape the tortured marriage a number of times, but Farrell, now rich and powerful, thwarts every attempt - trapping her in the marriage that has become a prison for them both. 
Obregon finally confiscates the casino and informs Farrell that Gilda was never truly unfaithful to Mundson or to him, prompting Farrell to decide to try and reconcile with her. At that moment, Mundson reappears, revealing he faked his suicide. He tries to kill both Gilda and Farrell but bartender Uncle Pio fatally stabs him. Obregon arrives and Johnny tries to take the blame for the murder. Obregon, however, is uninterested in arresting anyone since Mundson is already legally dead.  Farrell gives Obregon the incriminating documents from Mundson''s safe.

Soon after, Astra – a two-year return mission to Venus by the United States Space Program – has its time of launch speeded up and half of the male flight crew are replaced by women shortly before take-off, including one Russian. Shortly before blastoff military alerts are put into effect.
After leaving Earth, the seven crew members of Astra deduce that they have been put together to restart the human race should the Chinese activate their device. Shortly after this, the device goes off and Earth is destroyed.
As Astra continues to Venus, the crew realizes that a safe landing on Venus is impossible unless the crew is reduced to three. One of the crew members tries to rape another, at which point she accidentally gets them both blown out of an airlock.
Two more crew-members—Danny and Major Bronski—are lost as they head out to repair a fault with the spaceship. However, they notice another spacecraft nearby and jump to it. The second craft proves to be a lost Soviet ship that disappeared piloted by a close friend of the Russian crew member.  Though its pilot is dead, Danny and Bronski successfully power up the Soviet ship. Before the two ships can rendezvous, contact with Astra is lost.
A disembodied voice cuts in, claiming to be the collective consciousness of the Venusian population. The voice informs the survivors (whom the Venusians refer to as the "Last of Man") in the Russian ship that Astra no longer exists (presumably destroyed somehow by the telepathic Venusians), and that no humans (due to their "self-destructive" potential) will be allowed to reach Venus. It gives a cryptic message regarding the prospect of starting new life in a "very strange and very great" place, somewhere far "beyond the rim of the universe," before the ship suddenly blasts off, apparently by the power of the Venusians, and the movie abruptly concludes.',NULL,NULL,'["Bobby Van","Ruta Lee","Mala Powers"]','["Sci-Fi"]','2.4','["tt0052379","tt0054950","tt0032390","tt0183884","tt0031143","tt0092648","tt0058084","tt0071426","tt0049900","tt0075990","tt0040249","tt0059920"]','["Bobby Van; Ruta Lee; Mala Powers; James Craig; Grant Williams; Henry Wilcoxon; Lori Scott; Doomsday; Armageddon; Mystic Nights Videos"]','[{"url":"/DoomsdayMachine1972.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/DoomsdayMachine1972_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/DoomsdayMachine1972_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','DoomsdayMachine1972',156751,'Q5297122','wp','["Stuart J.

A young private is credited with intercepting some vital information which his superiors dismiss; other sailors play baseball or attend religious services (where the chaplain immediately concludes the service with the statement, "Men, man your battle stations, and God bless you!").
Then, "like locusts", the Japanese planes start humming over the air above Oahu, and begin the now infamous attack on American military installations on the island, including the sinking of the Arizona, and the bombing of Hickam Field. All the while, back in Washington, Japanese diplomats are still talking with Secretary of State Cordell Hull.
An animated sequence is then shown, with radio towers over Japan, broadcasting a fictional speech by Prime Minister Hideki Tojo. The narrator contradicts most of the "facts" that the Japanese leader tells his listeners in Tokyo, Nagasaki and Otaru, and Kobe (the height of the radio towers shown is assumed to be proportional to the respective station''s carrier power: 500 kW for Tokyo; 50 kW for Nagasaki and Otaru; and 10 kW for Kobe).
After the attack, Honolulu is not the same; the island is put under martial law, barbed wire and other protective barriers are set up in case of invasion and even children have to be evacuated and given gas masks.

When Wilse meets with her, she sends him to the town of Fallbrook, where he is to await her instructions in dealing with a former lover of hers, a banker named Micha Hadley (William Welsh), who had betrayed her. Dilling is to pose as a telegraph operator in his effort to watch the banker.
Being practically dependent on crutches and wheelchair-bound has not stopped Dilling from committing a lengthy series of crimes, but to his surprise, he finds that the small town atmosphere makes him feel differently about everything. He finds a good friend in Hadley''s daughter Gertrude (Virginia Valli), whom Dilling not only falls in love with her but she helps him believe that he can make a fresh start. Gertrude, however, is engaged to Jack Cooper (Jack Mower).
Dilling''s new-found contentment is soon shattered by a series of new developments which includes trying to stop Queen Ann''s plot against Hadley and Gertrude. Threatened with exposure as a thief, Hadley lashes out at Dilling when he confesses his part in the scheme. When an attempt to blow up the bank goes badly, Gertrude and Cooper are caught in the blast. With Gertrude severely injured, Cooper''s father forces him to break off their engagement.
With the bank records destroyed, bank examiners are unable to find evidence against Hadley. After surgery, his daughter is expected to make a complete recovery but Queen Anne still seeks his revenge. Dilling tries to recover a document that his boss is holding, but with her henchmen, she captures Gerturde to Dilling''s despair. Before anything can happen, everyone in the Manadarin Cafe, the gangsters'' headquarters, as well as the entire city, is caught up in the San Francisco earthquake.

He is joined by Sergeant Ned Fletcher (Hartnell), a veteran of the British Expeditionary Force. 
A patient, mild-mannered officer, Perry does his strenuous best to turn the bunch of grumbling ex-civilians into soldiers, earning himself their intense dislike. The conscripts also believe that the sergeant is treating them with special severity; in fact, he is pleased with the way they are developing and has his eye on some of them as potential NCOs. Eventually, however, the men come to respect both sergeant and officer.
After completing their training, the battalion is shipped out to North Africa to face Rommel''s Afrika Korps, but their troopship is torpedoed en route, and they are forced to abandon ship. Sergeant Fletcher is trapped by a burning vehicle sliding on the deck as the boat heels to one side, but is rescued by Perry and several of the men. The survivors are taken on board a destroyer and are sent to Gibraltar, missing the invasion.
When they eventually get to North Africa, the group is assigned to guard a small town. Perry appropriates a cafe as his headquarters, much to the disgust of the pacifist owner, Rispoli (Ustinov). When the Germans attack, Perry and his men fiercely defend their positions, aided by Rispoli. At one point, the Germans invite them to surrender; their response is "Go to Hell!" The besieged British soldiers fix bayonets and join other surviving units in advancing on the enemy, hidden in the smoke from explosions.

Jamaica Inn is the rural headquarters of a gang of cutthroats and thieves, led by innkeeper Joss Merlyn (Leslie Banks). They are responsible for a series of engineered shipwrecks in which they extinguish coastal warning beacons, causing ships to run aground on the rocky Cornish coast. They then kill the surviving sailors and steal their cargo. On one evening, a young Irishwoman, Mary Yellan (Maureen O''Hara), is dropped off by coach near the inn, at the home of the local squire and justice of the peace, Sir Humphrey Pengallan (Charles Laughton). She requests the loan of a horse so she can ride to Jamaica Inn to re-unite with her Aunt Patience, the wife of Merlyn. Despite Pengallan''s warnings, she intends to live at Jamaica Inn with her dead mother''s sister. Shortly after, we learn that Pengallan is the secret criminal mastermind behind the wrecking gang; he learns from his well-to-do friends and acquaintances when well-laden ships are passing near the coast, determines when and where the wrecks are to be caused, and fences the stolen cargo. He uses the lion''s share of the proceeds to support his lavish lifestyle and passes a small fraction of them to Joss and the gang.
In another part of the inn, the gang convenes to discuss why they get so little money for their efforts. They suspect Jem Trehearne (Robert Newton), a gang member for only two months, of embezzling goods. They hang him from one of the rafters of the inn, but when they leave, Mary cuts the rope and saves his life. Trehearne and Mary flee the gang, narrowly avoiding capture by swimming for their lives. The next morning, they row a boat ashore to seek the protection of Pengallan, unaware that he is the gang''s benefactor. Trehearne reveals to Pengallan that he is actually an undercover law-officer on a mission to investigate the wrecks. Pengallan is alarmed but maintains his composure and pretends to join forces with Trehearne. Mary overhears their conversation and goes to the inn to warn Patience that she must flee in order to avoid being arrested as an accomplice. However, Patience refuses to leave her husband. 
Meanwhile, Pengallan learns of a ship full of precious cargo headed near the coast. He tips off Joss and the gang, who travel to the beach, dousing the coastal warning light, waiting for the ship to appear. However, Mary re-lights the warning beacon, and the ship''s crew avoid the treacherous rocks and sail by unharmed. The gang angrily resolve to kill Mary as revenge for preventing the wreck, but Joss, who has developed a reluctant admiration for her, rescues her and the two escape by horse-cart. Joss is shot in the back and collapses when they reach Jamaica Inn. As Patience is about to tell Mary that Pengallan is the secret leader of the wrecking gang, Pengallan shoots and kills Patience from off-camera. Joss dies of his wound as well. Pengallan then takes Mary hostage, ties and gags her, and tells her that he plans to keep her now that she has no one else in the world. He drives her, still tied up and covered by a heavy cloak, to the harbour, where they board a ship bound for France. Back at Jamaica Inn, Trehearne and a posse of soldiers take Joss''s gang into custody. Trehearne then rides to the harbor to rescue Mary and capture Pengallan, who attempts to escape. At one point during the chase, he climbs to the top of a ship''s mast, from which he jumps to his death.','["Alfred Hitchcock"]','["Sidney Gilliat","Joan Harrison"]','["Maureen O''Hara","Robert Newton","Charles Laughton"]','[""]','6.3','["tt0029811","tt0028231","tt0028212","tt0023285","tt0039694","tt0025452","tt0032484","tt0022395","tt0033922","tt0042994","tt0024747","tt0023395"]','["Hitchcock; suspense; murder; pirates"]','[{"url":"/JAMAICA_INN.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/JAMAICA_INN_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/Jamaica_Inn_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','Jamaica_Inn',112641,'Q497005','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

While detective Blake suspects the misanthropic mentalist is behind these horrible crimes, the only real evidence the police have to go on is a webbed footprint found at the first crime scene and a sketch of the creature based on a description from an eye witness who caught a glimpse of it after one of the murders, and they seem powerless to stop Basso''s reign of terror.
Handsome young Air Force psychologist Captain Ted Dell, a respected scientist in the field of psychic research, gets involved in the case when his fiancee Lynn drags him to a party her father, retired business tycoon Sam Crane, is putting on for the rich guests at his Tanglewood Country Club and Resort where Basso is providing the entertainment. The cheerfully cynical Crane sees Basso as only another opportunity to con money out of a gullible public, but Ted becomes fascinated with the unhappy Doreena, the true source of Basso''s paranormal power, and vows to free her from the unhealthy mental domination that the romantically obsessed Basso has her under.
With Ted''s help, Doreena starts to gain the willpower to resist Basso, but not before the police confront the murderous million year old monstrosity down at a closed off beach, although their bullets have no effect on the indestructible creature.  Angered at Ted''s interference, Basso tries to kill him, but Doreena leaps in front of the gun and is shot instead, and her death causes the Gill Monster to fall to the ground and vanish back into the distant past.

Ben Merril (Connors) has set up a dragstrip for them where they can race under controlled, safe conditions. But after a race meet, Steve Northrup (Del Erickson) is goaded into a street race, while his brother Jeff (Smith) is a passenger. Steve ignores Jeff''s entreaties to not race. Steve is killed in the ensuing crash and a heartbroken Jeff breaks off all contact with the other drag-racing kids. He also avoids Lisa Vernon (Nelson), his girlfriend, who is also a drag racer.
A biker jacket-wearing bully named Bronc Talbott (Mark Andrews) arrives in town and after terrorizing the teens, appoints himself leader of them, replacing Jeff in that role. Following an argument at the teens'' hangout, a diner run by Yo-Yo (Fred Essler), Bronc challenges Flat Top (Frank Gorshin) to a chicken race, in which they''ll accelerate their cars straight at each other until one loses his nerve, swerves and becomes the "chicken". Although he''s clearly frightened, an angry Flat Top agrees. During the race, Flat Top swerves at the last second. Bronc is cockier than ever after winning, but Flat Top has realized that chicken-racing is insanely dangerous and tells his girlfriend Judy (Carolyn Kearney) that he was stupid and promises to remain "a coward" for the rest of his life.
Ben is meanwhile trying to find a way to run Bronc out of town. Under the threat of arrest, he forces Bronc to take his car to the dragstrip for that day''s races. Jeff is safety inspector for the dragstrip and after discovering several serious problems with Bronc''s car, refuses to clear him to race. Bronc vows revenge.
Jeff and Lisa reunite and go for a quiet drive on the local winding mountain roads. Bronc shows up, driving around corners on the wrong side of the road, passing Jeff and slowing down, forcing Jeff to overtake him. Lisa and Jeff decide to speed away from Bronc. But then a boy on a bicycle comes coasting down a hill. Both Jeff and Bronc take evasive action, but the boy is struck by one of the cars and killed. Ben doesn''t know which car hit the boy. Lisa and Jeff don''t know either because they were knocked out in the crash. Bronc swears to Ben that Jeff hit the kid and with no other witnesses, Ben arrests Jeff.
Ben is suspended from the police force by Capt. Logan (Russell Thorson) following a public outcry about the crash. But Ben continues his own investigation. Suspicious that Bronc is to blame, he takes scrapings of bicycle paint from Bronc''s car, proving that it was Bronc who hit the boy, At Yo-Yo''s, Ben confronts Bronc. Bronc smashes a soda bottle on Ben''s head, knocking him unconscious in an attempt to escape. Just as this happens, Jeff and Lisa come in. Jeff and Bronc have a fistfight and Jeff knocks Bronc to the floor, dazing him. Bronc lands right next to Ben, who revives and arrests Bronc on a charge of manslaughter.','["Leslie H.

These were Earth-based space policemen who patrolled the United Worlds of the Solar System in the not-too-distant future. Rocky and his crew would routinely blast-off in a V-2-like chemically-fueled, upright rocketship, the Orbit Jet XV-2 which was later replaced by the nearly identical Silver Moon XV-3, on missions to moons and planetoids where the odds of success seemed remote yet they would always prevail. Although they might destroy a rocketship full of unseen bad guys, their space pistols were never fired at people, and conflicts were always resolved with fistfights.
Although many strange worlds were visited, the alien characters usually spoke American English, and  always appeared as normal humans, albeit in bizarre costumes and environments.  The script-writers did not appear to know the difference between planets, moons, stars and constellations, so that the specific locations Rocky and his sidekicks visited are generally unknown to astronomers.

('tt0080532','free','A Christmas Without Snow (1980)','1980','2h','A divorcee, Zoe Jensen (Michael Learned), moves to San Francisco from Omaha in an effort to rebuild her life. She has reluctantly left her young son back home with his grandmother until she is more financially secure. She joins a local church choir which has just gained a new, demanding choirmaster—retired music conductor Ephraim Adams (John Houseman). Adams challenges the choir to dramatically improve, creating discomfort for some of the members, particularly when he sets the high goal of performing Handel''s Messiah for a Christmas concert. Meanwhile, the choir overcome personal setbacks as they all deal with personal issues.
A teacher by profession, Zoe soon learns no positions are available and that she lacks training to perform more readily available work. Living in an inexpensive flat, she brushes up her typing skills in order to gain employment before her mother wearies of looking after her son, who is growing anxious from his separation from Zoe.
Zoe receives her grounding at church, where an assortment of inner-city residents range from a former opera singer to a student seeking to educate himself for a life in a profession. The opera singer falls by the wayside when ego gets in her way, while the student is falsely accused of vandalism to the church organ simply because of his race, yet is vindicated by those who know and believe in him. Together, they persevere in the church choir. Along the way, Zoe finds an office job and, with the help of a bargain hunter, prepares a pleasant home for her son and herself.
Unexpected talent abounds within the choir. The amateurs give their best as ones who perform for the love of the music. This love extends far beyond the choir loft and is exemplified when the choir members band together to make the needed repairs to the organ pipes.
At a pre-performance holiday dinner the choir sees a different side of Ephraim Adams as he presents gifts to the choir members and joins in the merriment. Weakness suddenly overtakes him and he collapses; at a local hospital it is determined he has had a stroke.
The choir performs the Messiah admirably at the Christmas concert, accompanied by the vintage organ, with a wheelchair-bound Adams in attendance.  The choir has progressed far beyond an unlikely group of city dwellers. They have become a family.','["John Korty"]','["John Korty","Richard Beban"]','["Michael Learned","John Houseman","Ramon Bieri"]','["Drama","Music"]','5.8','["tt0032247","tt0037150","tt0094873","tt0039324","tt0132893","tt0436855","tt0076067","tt0075449","tt0090839","tt0066062","tt0403120","tt0282842"]','["Drama;Christmas;Movie Powder;avi;pdmovies;John Houseman"]','[{"url":"/AChristmasWithoutSnow_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/MoviePowderPresentsAChristmasWithoutSnow.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/MoviePowderPresentsAChristmasWithoutSnow_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','AChristmasWithoutSnow',168851,'Q4655925','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Andre sets out to investigate Helene''s true identity and, in doing so, learns the Baron''s darkest secret: after he found Ilsa with another man, the Baron killed his wife while his servant killed her lover.
Over the last two years, the Baron has been tormented by Ilsa''s ghost, who has beseeched him to kill himself so that they can be together forever. After much hesitation, the Baron decides to do so and atone for his crimes. Unbeknownst to him, Ilsa''s ghost is being commanded to haunt him by a peasant witch named Katrina.
After preventing the Baron from killing himself, Andre and Stefan, the Baron''s major domo, capture Katrina and force her into compliance. Katrina then reveals herself to be the mother of a man named Eric, whom she believes that the Baron killed 20 years before and hopes to avenge his death by damning his soul to Hell. In a stunning revelation, Stefan reveals that Eric was Ilsa''s lover, that it was the Baron who had died 20 years ago, not Eric, and that Eric felt so guilty about it that he took the Baron''s place, pretending to be him (thus explaining why the Baron had never left the castle in the past 20 years). Over the years, Eric has convinced himself that he is the true Baron von Leppe.
Realizing her error too late, Katrina goes with Andre and Stefan to stop Eric from flooding the castle crypt. Katrina''s pact with the devil, however, makes her unable to walk on consecrated ground and she ends up burning to death after being struck by lightning.
At the von Leppe castle, Eric floods the crypt as Ilsa''s ghost attempts to kill him and Stefan struggles to stop her. By the time Andre gains access to the crypt, it is already starting to cave in and he is only able to save Helene.

He joins the tiny second dental assistant in the back room. They have a brief squabble then Charlie goes to the waiting room to clean the floor with a carpet sweeper. He bumps into a patient and a further squabble starts. Then back to the rear room for more squabbling.
The dentist arrives, and his first patient goes in, obviously in pain. The dentist prepares the nitrous oxide anaesthetic (also known commonly as "laughing gas" due to its effects prior to and after unconsciousness). With the man unconscious he pulls his tooth, but then he can''t get him to wake up. He calls for Charlie and when he arrives the dentist runs off.

The dentist then returns and Charlie is sent to the drug store to get a prescription. After more fighting with the patients, he goes from Dr Pain''s surgery to the Sunset Pharmacy. He strikes a man standing at a news-stand outside. He looks at a woman (the dentist''s wife) and Charlie kicks him in the stomach before chasing the woman himself, and an incident occurs where she loses her skirt and runs off in embarrassment. He continues fighting with the man, who receives a brick in the face, thus becoming another dental patient.  A second brick hits a passer-by equally losing him a tooth.

('tt0063145','free','''It''s Alive!'' (1969)','1969','1h 20min','Norman Sterns (Corveth Ousterhouse) and Leela Sterns (Shirley Bonne) are newlyweds who are driving from their home in New York City to Los Angeles. They become lost and run out of gas, stranding them in the rural Ozark countryside. They meet a friendly paleontologist named Wayne Thomas (Tommy Kirk). Wayne suggests that they visit the nearest farm that could provide gas. The farm is run by a strange man named Greely (Bill Thurman), who tells them that the gasoline truck was supposed to arrive the previous day, but since it didn''t, he expects it there any minute. Greely suggests that they go inside to the parlor, where it''s cooler. On the way up to the house, he asks if they know anybody out here, in case they may be waiting for them. They say no, and when they get inside, Greely goes off to tell his "housekeeper", Bella (Annabelle Weenick) to make some iced tea. She argues with him on what he will "do with them", but Greely smacks her, and threatens that she will "take their place" if she doesn''t serve them some tea.
Thomas arrives and Greely goes outside. He tells them that their car won''t start. Wayne decides to take a look at the engine and tells Greely to go back to his truck and get a tool. Greely instead beats him on the back of the head with it and drags his body off. Meanwhile, Leela appears to be worried about Greely, because he is acting strange and his eyes don''t look right. She then compares his eyes to a stuffed lizard across the room. Greely comes back inside and tells them that he had to do a chore. Leela wants to go back outside, but Greely tells them that they could check out his "collection" while waiting for the truck.
He takes them out to the yard and shows them his "zoo", which includes ordinary animals like turtles, rattlesnakes, coyotes and a bobcat. Greely then tells them that they should have a look at his "prize", which is located deep in a mountain cave system behind his home. He puts them in a small room which he claims he had set up for tourists while he goes to turn on the rest of the power. However, it was a trap, as Greely pulls a lever and drops some bars down, blocking their way out. Greely leaves the cave, laughing as Leela discovers that Thomas is inside the cell as well, badly wounded but alive. He tells them that Greely threw him into another cavern below them, and left him there, but he found a way out and crawled in the cell, right as they arrived.
Norman suggests that there may be a way out down there, and begins a descent into the cavern. A reluctant Wayne and Leela follow and discover a prehistoric, aquatic dinosaur coming out of a spring, which Greely apparently feeds live victims to. Greely catches them in the enclosure and points a pistol at them, attempting to force them down in there to be eaten. Greely shoots Wayne in the abdomen, but Wayne throws an object at Greely and hits his gun hand, causing the pistol to fall into the enclosure. Norman urges Leela to go for the gun, but Greely tells him that it won''t do him any good, and leaves. Norman rushes down and gets the pistol, but suddenly the monster appears out of the water as Leela and Wayne warn him. Norman fires the gun at the creature, but it has no effect, and it kills him before he gets the chance to escape. Bella arrives and reveals that she is not Greely''s housekeeper; he kidnapped her and abused her until her will was broken and she agreed to do whatever he told her to do to avoid being fed to the creature. Wayne convinces Bella to help them.
Wayne remembers that he has some dynamite in his car, and he asks Bella to sneak upstairs and bring back some of it. Greely becomes suspicious of Bella, and he drugs the coffee that she brings to the prisoners. Leela and Wayne are overcome by the drug, but not before Wayne hides the dynamite.  When Wayne comes to, he retrieves it, but Greely intervenes and threatens to feed Leela to the creature if she will not willingly become his new servant. Bella, having heard that he plans to dispose of her, goes down there.
Greely recovers his pistol, but Wayne overcomes Greely and knocks him unconscious. Bella ignites the dynamite and explains to Greely that she plans to blow up the cave to kill both the dinosaur and Greely. Greely grabs his pistol and kills her, right as the monster is about to kill Greely. The dynamite explodes, collapsing the cavern and burying the dinosaur and Greely. Wayne and Leela escape in Wayne''s car to an unknown future.','["Larry Buchanan"]',NULL,'["Tommy Kirk","Shirley Bonne","Bill Thurman"]','["Horror","Sci-Fi"]','2.7','["tt0054462","tt0061412","tt0051064","tt0071675","tt4301262","tt0067248","tt0101366","tt0061529","tt0060270","tt0037219","tt0059161","tt0054111"]','["it''s alive,sci-fi,monster,horror"]','[{"url":"/ItsAlive.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/ItsAlive_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/ItsAlive_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','ItsAlive',55884,'Q3596208','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

On this happy day only one thing is slightly bothering Jack; the house he has purchased is well below the market value due to rumours that the house next door is a haunted house. The house next door is actually used by a Nazi German spy ring, led by Emil (Bela Lugosi). Emil is furious that his minion has sold the neighbouring house to Jack, as it will be needed for future activities as both houses are connected by secret tunnels. Emil orders his minion, Tony (Wheeler Oakman) to buy it back from Jack.

('tt0026668','free','Make a Million (1935)','1935','1h 8min','Professor Reginald Q. Jones (Charles Starrett), Associate Professor for Social Economics at Pelton University (founded 1912 A.D.), has a very clear picture of how in the United States economic inequality should be changed:
Scene in Class, Professor talks:
«Young man, the only thing that is wrong with the money today in this country, is that the wrong people have it. Fortunes are amassed by an incompute millionaires in the attempt to set aristocracy and wealth, instead of achievement. Does this answer your question?»
Student answers:
«Yes Sir.»
Picture shows into the class:
A female student with a pencil and notebook. She is writing, while the professor talks. Then the camera shows what she has written and you see it''s a caricature of the Professor, with the words: Professor Jones Full of Importance. He gets $25 a week and he knows all about Money.
Professor continues:
«Oh, and while we are on the subject of an incompute millionaires, it might be well to consider my plan on limiting the antics of their offspring by establishing a 90% inheritance tax.»
The drawing student in the first row laughs loudly.
The Professor says to her:
«Evidently Miss Corning (Pauline Brooks) you don‘t agree with my idea.»
She answers:
«I certainly do not»
Then he invites her to show him what she has written. Reluctantly she shows him her drawing. Then he asks her what she thinks about the matter. She then says:
«there is nothing wrong with the money, it‘s the people. If they weren‘t lazy they would go out and find a job.»
He: Does this idea originate from you or your father?
She: My father thinks the same as me.
He: Maybe that‘s wrong with the banking business.
Irene Corning tells her father, the rich banker, who complaints with the University Director, and as the University is partly financed by this same banker, Professor Reginald Q. Jones is called to explain. He sticks to his theories and so the University Board decides he is dismissed from classes until he can prove that his theories are applicable in real life.
He then finds himself without money in the campus, with a homeless man, Pete (James Burke (actor)), asking him for a dollar. He tells Pete he gave him the day before a dollar. When Pete answers he got it two days before a policeman arrives and wants to arrest Pete. When Professor Jones hears that the street beggars have to be removed from the streets on the order of Mr. Moxey, he pretends that Pete is a friend of his and protects him. He tells the Policeman he was going to borrow two dollars from Pete. He so comes to his first two dollar.  As Pete wants back his two bucks note Professor Jones answers he is out of the job and needs himself the money. As he had given to Pete before it was right to get back some of it. So he proposes to be taught panhandling. Pete shows him some tricks, as the ''civil war act'', the system he and his fellow beggars have all over town. Jones goes with Pete, staying at a little Room for Rent called Fritz. Pete and his fellow beggars have a meeting with him trying to find out how to make him work in their racket. But they agree he has not the personality and no talent for it. 
So he is asked what he is good at. Theory of finance, History of banking, surplus and distribution. The men in the meeting are quite surprised.
One says: Too bad. You college men present a very great problem!
When he gets a visit for an interview from the World improvement league, those same people through their questions give him the big idea:
He will ask the people to make him a public millionaire to show his ideas, through public subscription of 1 dollar each. Larkey a PR-scoundrel (George E. Stone) likes Jones'' idea as he sees how much money he can make. His first move is to go to rich Moxey (newspaper owner), who starts a wide newspaper campaign against Professor Jones. So the first step of publicity is made out of nearly nothing and the public already splits in pro''s and con''s, sending a dollar each to Professor Jones. At first Jones is furious with Larkey. When he explains, that to get the first page he would have had to pay 5 Million dollars and he got it for free, he realizes that it could turn in his favor.
As he goes to see the Banker Mr. Corning in presence of his former student, the daughter Corning, only two days of his campaign, he is already in the position to deposit 25.000 $. The Cornings are obviously astonished. He opened a safe deposit box and puts there the 25.000 $ in one dollar bills. The Corning see another chance to break him by calling the postal authorities. Meantime Larkey has organized big banners and a whole campaign with the newspapers. When the authorities come to Jones, he is fortunately able to say he is working as an Organization: The World Improvement League. And he has to say it is a responsible Organization. So Moxey and Corning tell him that he has to appear with his board of directors Friday morning. That he has to put the money in a trust fund until the outcome of the meeting.
As Jones tell Pete and Larkey that there is no World Improvement League, that it was only a name he made up at University, Pete doesn''t capitulate and starts an intensive fast training with his fellow beggars to become a fine bunch of public-spirited citizens financiers until Friday.
Pete resumes the receipt against depression: When the people have more doe, they have more doe to give away!
At the meeting: one, the london delegate tries to steel cigars, the Greek Chancellor talks to a financier telling him about the disastrous food conditions in Greek so that this one is willing to give the Greek some money. And Pete looking everywhere to control his men. As Irene intrudes the meeting, the whole setup is revealed. The Inspector gives Jones 15 days to complete the fund, if not the money has to be redistributed to the public.
Jones has the chance to get into a radio transmission, supported by a toothpaste- enterprise: Nervo, how much nerve you can have using Nervo. He should have about 15 Million people audience; so he and his fellows hope to be able to get the rest of the money. But Corning doesn''t pass the cheque about 1000,- $ Nervo sends Jones as advance for expense money to get the boys to Chicago, because he wants to prevent Jones to get his voice to an audience of 15 Million people. His daughter Irene at that point changes side: she tells her dad that what he does is illegal. Corning asserts the public has to be protected from fools as Jones is. He sends back the cheque to Nervo.
Irene talks with Jones, Pete and Larkey and she is able to convince Jones to go with her car to Chicago, while Pete and the boys will arrange with the railroad. Larkey reads them a telegram from Nervo telling them, they are expected in Chicago.
A street chase starts, during which Irene and "Reggie" get closer. At night resting in the car she asks him what he will do, when he will have the million. He says he will distribute the surplus. On the question if it will change his life, he answers: the trouble in this country is the uncertainty of disposing of the surplus. The manufactures sold part of the goods to the profit. And if the remaining would be bought by the government at the cost of material and labour, there would be no failure.
Asked by Jones to repeat what he said, Irine answers: Surplus women and no distribution!
In Chicago Jones is able to talks some minutes to the Radio audience thanks to Pete making the show of his life as an epileptic to divert the police. Finally Jones is able to distribute the surplus, as the million is achieved: every citizen who gave one dollar is rewarded by a good worth 3,- $, and the manufacturers received cash pay off their obligations. So he demonstrated what could be done with his theories.
Larkey brings new letters from all over the country. People were so satisfied with the articles they got from the Million fund, that they write Jones to do it again. "Bargain of the month club" is going to be the name of the enterprise, and to earn something Irene suggested to take from each dollar 1 penny, that would make 10.000,-$ a month by 1 Million. The men and Pete are distributed all over the United States to run each a branch of the enterprise. And finally Irene has made of Professor Jones a rich man, as her father. And herself, just a wife!','["Lewis D. Collins"]','["Emmett Anthony","Charles Logue"]','["Charles Starrett","Pauline Brooks","George E.

One day, Pip runs into an escaped convict, Abel Magwitch (Finlay Currie), who intimidates the boy into getting him some food and a file for his chains. Magwitch is caught when he attacks a hated fellow escapee, and is taken back to the prison ship.
Miss Havisham (Martita Hunt), an eccentric rich spinster, arranges to have Pip come to her mansion regularly to provide her with company and to play with her adopted daughter, a cruel but beautiful teenage girl, Estella (Jean Simmons). Estella mocks Pip''s coarse manners at every opportunity, but Pip quickly falls in love with her. The visits come to an end when Pip turns 14 and begins his apprenticeship as a blacksmith. Estella also leaves, for France, to learn to become a lady.
Six years later Miss Havisham''s lawyer, Mr. Jaggers (Francis L. Sullivan), visits Pip (played as adult by John Mills) to tell him that a mysterious benefactor has offered to transform him into a gentleman, one with "great expectations"; Pip assumes it is Miss Havisham. He is taken to London, where Mr. Jaggers arranges for Pip to stay with Herbert Pocket (played as an adult by Alec Guinness), who will teach him how to behave like a gentleman. From Herbert, Pip learns that Miss Havisham was left at the altar many years ago; she is determined to avenge herself against all men, and Estella is her instrument to break men''s hearts.
After Pip turns 21, Joe Gargery comes to visit him, bringing a request from Miss Havisham to visit her. There he is delighted to be reunited with Estella (played as an adult by Valerie Hobson), who tells him, "You must know, Pip, I have no heart." Estella and Pip spend much time together. She confesses to Pip that despite flirting with the wealthy but unpopular Bentley Drummle, she has absolutely no feelings for him. Pip suddenly receives another visitor from the past, Magwitch, who reveals that he is Pip''s patron. Pip, who always imagined that Miss Havisham was responsible for his good fortune, now realises that she was only using him.
Growing suspicious of Drummle''s overtures towards Estella, Pip visits Estella at the old woman''s house, where she tells him that she is going to marry Drummle. Pip confronts Miss Havisham, saying "I am as unhappy as you could have ever meant me to be." Miss Havisham, finally realising what she has done, begs his forgiveness. Pip leaves, but when she stands up to follow him, a piece of flaming wood from the fireplace rolls out and ignites Miss Havisham''s dress. Her screams alert Pip, who runs back to save her, but fails.
After being warned that an old enemy (the other escapee at the beginning of the film) knows that Magwitch is in London, Pip makes preparations to smuggle the old man onto a packet boat and accompany him to the continent. Pip, Herbert and Magwitch row out to the packet boat, but are intercepted by the waiting police, tipped off by Magwitch''s great enemy. Magwitch is seriously injured in a struggle with his nemesis, who dies when caught in the packet''s paddlewheels. He had spoken to Pip of his lost daughter, and Pip''s suspicion that she is Estella is confirmed by Mr. Jaggers. Pip visits the dying Magwitch and tells him of her fate, and that he, Pip, is in love with her; Magwitch passes away, a contented man.
Stricken by illness and with his expectations gone, Pip is taken home and nursed back to health by Joe Gargery. He revisits Miss Havisham''s deserted house, where he finds Estella. Her plans for the future have also gone awry, as Drummle had broken off their engagement after Mr. Jaggers informed him of her true parentage.

While the feelings are mutual and Richard wishes to propose, he can never find a moment to speak to Beth alone—she is constantly surrounded by admirers and her overprotective father (Wadsworth Harris).
Richard explains his predicament to his friends, young married couple William and Maude Harcourt (Charles Dorian and Mary Warren). They agree to help by hosting Richard and Beth at a private dinner at their home. Beth''s father agrees to let her dine with the Harcourts, but insists that she keep to an 11:00 curfew.
The evening of the dinner William Harcourt receives a telegram from a prospective business associate, Bradford (William Dyer), informing him that he is arriving that night for a surprise visit. The announcement throws the Harcourts into a panic. William has recently mortgaged his home and life savings to buy a copper mine; he is counting on a $1-million investment from Bradford to save his business and house. He does not have any servants to welcome the millionaire, having fired them earlier in the day in a fit of rage.
Working together, the four friends devise a plan: Richard and Beth will pose as the Harcourts; the real Harcourts will play the servants because they are familiar with the layout of their house. The scheme initially works, but things quickly deteriorate when Bradford, an eccentric, overbearing man, starts flirting with Maude Harcourt and insisting that Richard and Beth turn in for the night. The situation worsens when Beth misses her curfew and her father shows up at the Harcourt home to look for her. Eventually, everything is solved, but not before Col. Lane is locked in the pantry, Richard falls out a window and William is tossed out of his own house.','["Paul Powell"]','["Edgar Franklin","Fred Myton"]','["Carmel Myers","Rudolph Valentino","Charles Dorian"]','["Comedy","Drama"]','6.1','["tt0009356","tt0009629","tt0010060","tt0007963","tt0197917","tt0012675","tt0177178","tt0012190","tt0009929","tt0012788","tt0011050","tt0010511"]','["Gen X,; Comedy; Drama; Silent Film; Rudolph Valentino; Carmel Myers"]','[{"url":"/1918AllNight.mp4","format":"h.264"}]','LhereuDeCanPrunaDe',2221,'Q3612132','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Athenian supporters of Hippias conspire, hoping to sideline Phillippides with a marriage to Theocrites'' expensive servant Charis, and thus neutralize the guard. She fails to seduce him, as his heart is already taken by a young girl before he learns her name is Andromeda, daughter of Creuso.

He has developed a friendly but occasionally terse feud with Police Commissioner Weston. Cranston complains to his managing editor, Edward Heath, about his incompetent new assistant, Phoebe Lane. Heath advises him that because she is the publisher''s niece, she cannot be fired. During his radio broadcast, Phoebe gives Cranston a note that the Metropolitan Theatre is to be robbed at eight o''clock. Afterwards, he learns she got the information from a man she met in a café. Cranston goes to the theatre; Weston and his men have already arrived, but there is no crime. Across town, international banker Gerald Morton is killed and his safe is robbed.
Cranston arrives there ahead of the police and gathers evidence. The irate Weston has him jailed as a material witness, but Phoebe gets him released with a writ of habeas corpus in time for his next broadcast. Honest John, a safe cracker whose release from prison was championed by Cranston, bursts into the studio and demands at gun point that Cranston exonerate him; the police suspect that he committed the Morton robbery. Weston rushes to the studio but Honest John escapes.
Cranston takes Phoebe on a tour of night clubs and she identifies the man who gave her the robbery warning. Cranston poses as a European visitor and introduces himself to the man, whose name is Flotow. Flotow recognizes Phoebe and invites them to join him and his companion, Starkov, at his apartment after the bar closes. They leave together, but Cranston suspects a trap. He makes excuses to allow Phoebe and himself to depart, but they make a lunch date for the next day.
While Flotow and Starkov are waiting for Cranston to join them for lunch, Cranston breaks into Flotow''s apartment and discovers Phoebe has already done the same. Cranston answers Flotow''s phone; Morton''s butler, believing him to be Flotow, tells him there is a meeting at the Morton home that afternoon. Flotow and Starkov return and attempt to detain Cranston and Pheobe. Moe, Cranston''s driver, rescues them by flashing his "gun", which is really a cigarette case. After they leave, Morton''s butler calls back and Flotow knows he is suspected.
Cranston finishes a newspaper column designed to bait Flotow. As he leaves to act on the intercepted butler''s call, Cranston is forced into Moe''s cab at gun point by Honest John. Cranston gets the upper hand by using Moe''s "gun". After John confesses that he only came back to town to get a fresh start, Cranston reveals the fake gun and forgives the "kidnapping". Commissioner Weston is angered by Cranston''s column and sends a man to arrest Cranston for withholding information from the police. The policeman gets a tip that Cranston is going to Morton''s house.
Flotow and Starkov arrive at the Morton house and are admitted by the duplicitous butler. They surprise Morton''s brother and force him to open the safe. As they explain their motive for killing his brother, they force him to write a "suicide" note and give him a gun with one bullet. Cranston and Honest John intervene. John holds the malefactors at gun point, while Cranston lets in the police. As Weston''s assistant tries to arrest Cranston, the butler tries to sneak out the front door. Cranston throws a potted plant to hit the butler but hits Commissioner Weston as he enters the door.
Cranston''s broadcast reveals the details of the case and compliments the police for their conduct of the investigation;  both Weston and Heath are pleased.

Col. Thorwald (Randolph Scott), with whom he has served  while stationed in China. Thorwald explains that he left the Corps to serve with the Chinese Red Army fighting the Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War to learn their methods and has decided to form a unit using the qualities of Gung Ho or "work together".
Among the volunteers for the unit are a hillbilly (Rod Cameron), who responds to a gunnery sergeant''s  (Walter Sande) question whether he can kill someone with the fact that he already has. Alan Curtis is an ordained minister keeping his vocation a secret. Robert Mitchum is "Pig Iron"; a boxer from a background of poverty and hard work. Harold Landon is a young and small street kid who is initially rejected by Naish but wins him over, as both worked as dishwashers on ships bound to the United States from Piraeus, Greece. Noah Beery Jr. and David Bruce are rivals for a United States Navy nurse (Grace McDonald). Volunteers with brief screen time include a Filipino wishing to avenge his sister (who was left behind in Manilla and may have been raped or killed by the Japanese) who teaches the Raiders knife fighting, an embittered marine who had a brother killed at Pearl Harbor, a veteran of the Spanish Civil War who sees the war as a continuation of the fight against fascism, and a Marine who honestly admits, "I just don''t like Japs".
The film moves rapidly in a documentary style, with stock footage of training narrated by Chet Huntley. Those who make it through the training are sent to Hawaii for further jungle warfare training, where they witness the damage of the attack on Pearl Harbor.

However, the creature survives the gunshots, and Gar, out of ammunition, picks up a ski pole and impales the beast, causing it to fall off a mountain. Gar looks down and hears the creature in pain as it dies.

When Leonard is ejected from a college campus for speaking to the students, a newspaper photographer takes a picture of him in Drue''s car and prints it on the front page. When Drue refuses to listen to reason, the general tricks her into boarding an airplane bound for Mexico, supposedly to see her aunt Betty off, then locks her in. 
She is stuck in Juarez with no money to get home. After a rowdy soldier, Jeff overhears a border policeman warn her not to try to cross into the US, Jeff, whom she nicknames "Uncle Sam", strikes up a conversation, telling her he thinks she should be shot. Despite their disdain for each other, they run up a large bar bill, but neither has any money. They skip out and drive away; then Drue tells him he has stolen a government car. When they reach a border crossing, Jeff tries to stop, but Drue presses the gas pedal and they speed into Texas. They manage to evade their pursuers, but crash into a tree.
They later kidnap P. J. Rooney, an easy-going, henpecked husband, to ride in his homemade trailer. He is glad to get away from his wife, Edith. They eventually con Baldy, a caretaker, into believing they are friends of his employer, Colonel Turner, and letting them stay in Turner''s house. After Jeff and Drue dance, he tells her he now loves her; after thinking it over, she kisses him before they turn in for the night, in separate rooms. She later sneaks out and tries to drive away, but the authorities show up and arrest them both.
General Van Allen gets Drue out of jail. He is worried about a newspaper story reporting that Drue and Leonard are going to get married and also about information he received from an immigration official that Leonard is not a citizen, but rather a suspected "paid propagandist" in the country on a student visa. When the general realizes that Drue has feelings for Jeff, he sends for Jeff. After speaking to him informally, the general sends him down to a meeting at which Leonard is supposed to speak. Jeff pretends to have changed his opinion to get Arner to let him talk to the audience. He starts out agreeing with Leonard''s position, then shows people what he really stands for. A riot breaks out, and Arner is taken into custody for deportation.

Julie Adams, Applejack''s old friend and owner of the album, asks him to turn off the tune and announces that she is leaving her husband Roger.
After glancing at the nursery, Julie restarts the song and remembers meeting Roger years earlier: The same ballad is playing over the loudspeakers at the Brooklyn music store where Julie works. When the record begins to skip, passerby Roger Adams enters the store and meets Julie. The two begin to date, and while at the beach one day, Julie breaks open a fortune cookie, which reads "you will get your wish --a baby." Roger, a confirmed bachelor who has no patience with children, hides his fortune, which predicts a "wedding soon," and replaces it with "you will always be a bachelor."
Roger, a reporter, changes his mind, however, when he bursts into a New Year''s Eve party with the news that his paper is assigning him to a post in Japan and asks Julie to marry him that evening. Knowing that they will not see each other for three months until Roger can earn enough money for Julie''s passage to Japan, the newlyweds kiss goodbye in Roger''s train compartment. As they embrace, the train pulls out, and as a result, Julie stays in Roger''s compartment until the train stops the next morning.
Three months later, when Julie is reunited with Roger in Japan, she reports that she is pregnant. Julie becomes concerned for the future of her family when she learns that Roger has lavishly furnished their house by spending advances on his salary. Later, when Roger inherits a small sum of money and announces that he has quit his job so that they can travel the world, Julie, disturbed by her husband''s financial irresponsibility, goes upstairs to pack. At that moment, a violent earthquake strikes, demolishing the house and causing Julie to lose the baby.
Roger and Julie return to San Francisco, and while hospitalized there, Julie learns that she will never be able to have children. Roger tries to console her by telling her that he wants to settle down and buy a small town paper, but Julie responds that a baby is all she ever wanted. Soon after, Roger buys the Rosalia Courier Press, and the couple moves into the apartment above the newspaper office, which is equipped with a small nursery. Roger hires their friend Applejack to manage the paper, but despite their hard work, circulation remains low.
Two years later, while Roger is working late one night, Applejack encourages Julie to adopt a child, and when Roger returns home, Applejack prods him into agreeing to consider adoption. When Julie writes to the orphanage to request a two-year-old boy with curly hair and blue eyes, Mrs. Oliver, the administrator, interviews the prospective parents and later pays a surprise visit to their home. At first disapproving because the Adams house is a cluttered mess, Mrs. Oliver is charmed by the little nursery and tells Julie that a five-week-old baby girl is available for adoption. When Julie and Roger protest that they wanted a two-year-old boy, the age their own baby would have been, Mrs. Oliver assures them that this is the child for them. Roger and Julie consent to see the infant, and when Julie falls in love with the baby, Mrs. Oliver allows them to take her home for a one-year probation period.
One year later, as the time for the adoption hearing approaches, Mrs. Oliver visits the family to update her records. When Julie admits that the paper has gone out of business and that Roger has no income, Mrs. Oliver solemnly caps her pen. Steeling themselves to return their baby, whom they have named Trina, to the orphanage, Roger bundles up the infant and proceeds to the judge''s chambers. When the judge denies the adoption, Roger, near tears, begs to keep the little girl, pleading that she is like his own child. Moved by Roger''s plea, the judge relents and grants the adoption, prompting Julie cheerily to proclaim that nothing can take Trina from them now.
Years pass, and Trina''s proud parents watch their daughter sing the echo to "Silent Night" in her school''s Christmas play. When Trina slips on a platform while onstage, she worries that she will not be allowed to play an angel in the play the following year.
The next Christmas, Mrs. Oliver receives a tragic letter from Julie, notifying her of Trina''s death after a sudden, brief illness. Julie confides that Roger is punishing himself for Trina''s fate and behaves like a stranger to her. At the Adams home, as Julie and Roger sit wordlessly in their living room, they hear a knock at the door. Julie answers it and finds a mother, frantic because her car is stalled and her son is due to perform in the school play. Julie and Roger offer to drive the mother and child to the play, and when the car arrives to the sound of children singing "Silent Night," Roger gets out and proclaims that he never again wants to see anybody or anything that reminds him of Trina.
Julie''s thoughts return to the present, and she takes the record off the turntable just as Applejack climbs the stairs to deliver her train ticket. At that moment, Roger returns, despondent, but as he picks up Julie''s suitcase to drive her to the train station, the phone rings. It is Mrs. Oliver, calling to offer the couple a two-year-old boy, who is the image of the youngster they requested years earlier.

('tt0081793','free','You Better Watch Out (1980)','1980','1h 40min','In suburban New Jersey, on Christmas Eve 1947, a young boy named Harry Stadling sees his mother being sexually groped by his father, who is dressed up as Santa Claus. Heartbroken, the child rushes up to the attic and cuts his hand with a shard of glass from a shattered snow globe.
33 years later, an adult Harry (Brandon Maggart) works in a low-level position at the Jolly Dreams toy factory, where his colleagues consider him a "schmuck" and make fun of him. At home, he has taken it upon himself to become the next true Santa: he sleeps in costume, and his apartment is resplendent with Christmas décor. He spies on neighborhood children to see if they are being "good" or "bad" and keeps detailed records of their behavior.
Harry''s coworker Frank asks Harry to cover his shift on the assembly line in order to be with his family. However, on his way home from work, Harry sees Frank drinking with friends at a local bar. Distressed by the man''s duplicity, Harry breaks one of his dollhouse figures while humming Christmas tunes. The following day, he cancels Thanksgiving dinner with his younger brother Phil (Jeffrey DeMunn) and his family. Phil has been constantly angered by his brother''s odd behavior, while Phil''s wife Jackie (Dianne Hull) is more sympathetic.
At the company Christmas party, the owner of Jolly Dreams, Mr. Wiseman, announces that the company will donate toys to the children of the local hospital, provided production increases sufficiently and the employees contribute with their own money. Mr. Fletcher, one of the company''s high-ranking executives, introduces Harry to new training executive George Grosch, who devised the donation scheme. Harry is angry at both for not really caring about the children. That night, he fills bags with toys he stole from the factory and other bags with dirt.
On Christmas Eve, while gluing a Santa beard to his face, he enters a fugue state that has him convinced to truly be Santa Claus. Donned in his Santa suit, Harry starts doing his rounds on the van that he decorated with a sleigh picture, and that he believes to have been trained by Santa Claus''s reindeer. He first sneaks into his brother''s home and delivers toys for his nephews; then leaves a bagful of dirt at the doorstep of "bad boy" Moss Garcia. Later, Harry drops off toys at the hospital, where he is greeted cheerfully by the staff.
On the street, Harry is taunted by three young men leaving Midnight Mass and, in a fit of rage, he partially blinds one of them with a toy soldier''s sword, then murders them all with a hatchet. Later, Harry is welcomed at a neighborhood Christmas party, where people think he is just some harmless Santa impersonator; he dances and cheers everyone up and makes sure the attending children know they will have to be good boys and girls to receive their gifts. He then breaks into Frank''s home and murders him in his bed with a Christmas tree decoration, leaving toys behind for his kids.
On Christmas morning, his Santa suit disheveled and dirty, Harry returns to Jolly Dreams and activates the assembly lines, breaking all the toys, which he considers subpar. Later, his van becomes stuck in the snow on a beautifully decorated street with plenty of lights, sending him further into a delusional state. The residents shortly recognize him as the murderer and form a torch-bearing mob to pursue him.
Harry manages to free his van from the snow and drives to his brother''s house, where Phil has already started to suspect something is seriously wrong with his brother. Harry confronts Phil, accusing him to have been the root cause of his childhood trauma, as Phil was the one who revealed to Harry that the Santa they saw was actually their father. Phil quickly realizes that Harry is the homicidal Santa from the news, and chokes him unconscious. He loads him into the front seat of the van; Harry soon regains his consciousness, knocks Phil out and drives off again. The angry mob forces him and his van off a bridge; the van is shown to fly off toward the moon as a voice-over reads the end of "The Night Before Christmas".','["Lewis Jackson"]',NULL,'["Brandon Maggart","Jeffrey DeMunn","Dianne Hull"]','["Horror","Thriller"]','5.5','["tt0070694","tt1686897","tt1656197","tt1016090","tt3831344","tt2521436","tt5780484","tt3758564","tt8080648","tt4066958","tt3665498","tt3397948"]','["asp''odfqwefj''"]','[{"url":"/6.Christmas Evil (1980).mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/6.ChristmasEvil1980_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','6.ChristmasEvil1980',784,'Q1254001','wp','["Lewis Jackson"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

When his wife, Henrietta (Florence Roberts), asks if he rewarded the young man, Parker shows his astonishment by saying that the hero had refused the thousand dollars he had offered. When the daughter, Dot (Dorothy Mackaill), remarks that she would like to meet a man like that, the father tells her not to worry, she will, for he is coming to dinner that very evening. Henrietta is aghast at having to socialize with someone not of their class, but Parker, who is a better judge of character, assures her that all will be well.
During dinner, Dot is smitten with the young man, Dick Brunton (Joel McCrea).  She makes a bet with her father that she can get him to marry her within four weeks.  The father takes that bet, and lo and behold she wins Dick''s heart and gets him to accept her proposal of marriage by the deadline, despite his fears of their different social circumstances.
After the wedding, Parker sends the newlyweds on an expensive honeymoon to Europe, after which they return to their lavish home, also supplied by Parker. Parker also promotes Dick, but within six months, his new lifestyle threatens to emasculate Dick, who loses interest in his career and finds himself dominated by Dot''s vapid, social whirl of bridge games, cocktail parties and passive acceptance of life as a "kept husband". This does not sit well with the proud husband, and when Parker offers him a chance to prove himself with a new position in St. Louis, he jumps at the chance. When told of the opportunity however, Dot is less than enthusiastic, not wanting to leave her friends and social circle. She refuses to agree to accompany Dick.
Dick decides to go to St. Louis, with or without Dot, making her incredibly upset. Not knowing what to do, he goes to ask advice from his mother (Mary Carr), who tells him that he needs to reconcile with Dot before he leaves for St. Louis. Meanwhile, Dot has agreed to meet with a former beau, Charles Bates (Bryant Washburn), who attempts to seduce her.  When she returns to their house the following morning, Dick questions her regarding her whereabouts. She lies to him, and he knows it, since he had seen her with Washburn the prior evening. Furious, he storms out, saying their marriage is over, and intending to resign from Parker''s company.
Realizing her love for him, Dot eventually finds Dick at the rail station, about to leave for St. Louis. He has decided to take Parker''s position after all. The husband and wife reconcile, with Dot agreeing to live within the means that Dick''s salary can provide.','["Lloyd Bacon"]','["Louis Sarecky","Forrest Halsey"]','["Clara Kimball Young","Joel McCrea","Dorothy Mackaill"]','["Drama","Romance"]','6.0','["tt0022149","tt0021377","tt0022046","tt0021374","tt0022569","tt0021092","tt0021649","tt0021684","tt0029682","tt0029102","tt0022918","tt0021756"]','["Drama"]','[{"url":"/KeptHusbands.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/KeptHusbands_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/KeptHusbands_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','KeptHusbands',14358,'Q3814726','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Now free, Gamera returns to Earth and destroys Kurobe Dam in Japan. At the same time, three mercenaries are sent by Kano, a World War II veteran, to an island in the South Pacific to retrieve a huge opal he once found and hid in a cave. Despite warnings from the local villagers, the trio find and locate the opal, but one dies from a fatal scorpion sting. The second man, Keisuke, Kano''s younger brother, is betrayed by his fellow expeditioner Onodera and apparently killed in a cave-in.
En route back to Japan, Onodera accidentally leaves the opal exposed to an infrared light. The heat incubates the opal - actually an egg - and a lizard eventually hatches. Growing to enormous size very quickly, the lizard destroys the ship and Kobe Harbor. Keisuke, having survived the cave-in, awakens in the care of the villagers. He then returns to Japan with a village girl called Karen, who refers to the lizard as Barugon. Barugon wreaks havoc in Osaka with its freeze-gas emitting tongue and stops the launching of the retaliative missiles with a rainbow-like ray emitted from seven spines on the middle of its back. Barugon encounters Gamera and the two battle, with Gamera eventually being frozen solid.
In the meantime, while debating with Kano on how to recover the opal, which he still believes to be aboard the sunken ship, Onodera inadvertently blurts out that he killed his two companions and then murders both Kano and Kano''s wife to cover up his crime. After finding Onodera, Keisuke and Karen subdue him and leave him tied up in his home. Keisuke and Karen travel to the Japanese defense ministry and suggest a plan using a huge diamond to lure Barugon into a lake to drown. The plan fails because the diamond''s radiation proves to be not enough. Another attempt by irradiating the diamond with additional infrared radiation almost succeeds, until Onodera, having been released and informed of the diamond by his wife, steals the gem. Both he and the diamond, however, are immediately devoured by Barugon.
Keisuke discovers that mirrors are not affected by Barugon''s rainbow ray, so the military devises a plan to reflect its own rainbow emanation back at it with a giant mirror. Barugon is wounded by its own ray, but despite prompting it cannot be goaded into repeating its mistake. Gamera thaws out and attacks Barugon once again, and after a destructive battle it drowns Barugon in Lake Biwa, then flies away. Remorseful over the disaster his greed has caused, with his brothers now dead, and having found love with Karen, Keisuke decides to make a fresh start on the island where it all began.','["Shigeo Tanaka"]',NULL,'["Kôjirô Hongô","Kyôko Enami","Yûzô Hayakawa"]','[""]','4.8','["tt0059080","tt0116390","tt0184503","tt0113142","tt0061868","tt0067123","tt0059205","tt0065776","tt0049782","tt0189764","tt0109916","tt0107027"]','["Gamera; Japanese Films; Giant Monsters"]','[{"url":"/WarOfTheMonsters1966_106_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/warofthemonsters.mpeg.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/warofthemonsters.mpeg_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','WarOfTheMonsters1966_106',25830,'Q1959868','wp','["Niisan Takahashi"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
('tt0029335','free','Oh, Mr. Porter! (1937)','1937','1h 25min','William Porter (Will Hay) is an inept railway worker who – due to family connections – is given the job of stationmaster at a remote and ramshackle rural Northern Irish railway station in the (fictitious) town of Buggleskelly, situated on the border with the then Irish Free State.
After taking the ferry from England to Northern Ireland, Porter is aghast when he discovers how isolated the station is. It is situated out in the countryside, two miles cross-country from the nearest bus stop. To make matters worse, local legend has it that the ghost of One-Eyed Joe the Miller haunts the line and, as a result, no-one will go near the station after dark.
Porter''s co-workers at the station are the elderly deputy stationmaster, Harbottle (Moore Marriott), and an overweight, insolent young porter, Albert (Graham Moffatt), who make a living by stealing goods in transit and swapping railway tickets for food. They welcome Porter to his new job by regaling him with tales of the deaths and disappearances of previous stationmasters – each apparently the victim of the curse of One-Eyed Joe.
From the beginning, the station is run very unprofessionally. Porter is woken up by a cow sticking its head through the window of the old railway carriage he is sleeping in (the cow has been lost in transit and is being milked by Harbottle), and the team''s breakfast consists of bacon made from a litter of piglets which the railway is supposed to be looking after for a local farmer.
Determined to shake things up (particularly after he is forced to deal with the irate farmer when he comes to collect his pigs), Stationmaster Porter tries to renovate the station in several ways, most sensibly by painting the entire station, but also by less conventional means – including stopping the passing express and organising an excursion to Connemara.
Porter attempts to drum up business among the local people in the pub by offering tickets to this excursion, but as the locals begin to argue about where the excursion should go a fight breaks out. Porter crawls to safety in the landlord''s rooms next door, where he meets a one-eyed man who introduces himself as Joe and offers to buy all of the tickets for an away game that the village football team, the Buggleskelly Wednesday, are playing the following day.
But Porter is unaware that he has really agreed to transport a group of criminals who are involved in running guns to the Irish Free State. The ''football'' train leaves at six a.m. the following morning, rather than the scheduled ten a.m., at the insistence of Joe and although Porter questions some of the odd packages being loaded onto the train, he accepts Joe''s claim that these are in fact goalposts for the game.
The train disappears as the smugglers divert it down a disused branch line near the border, and with everybody claiming that Porter has lost his mind (there is no such team as Buggleskelly Wednesday, and Harbottle points out that the local team wouldn''t leave without him as he is their centre forward). Unfortunately this huge misunderstanding causes Porter to lose his job, since no one has seen the train. Then after his co-workers talk about a tunnel on a nearby disused branch line, Porter decides to head off to track down the errant engine (in hopes of getting his job back).
The trio find the missing train inside a derelict railway tunnel, underneath a supposedly haunted windmill. They investigate and are briefly captured by the gun runners, but escape and climb progressively higher up the windmill until eventually they are trapped at the top.
Using the windmill sails, they contrive to get down where they hatch a plan to capture the gun runners. Coupling the carriages containing the criminals and their guns to their own engine, Gladstone, they carry them away from the border at full speed, burning everything from Harbottle''s underwear to level crossing gates they smash through in order to keep up steam. To keep the criminals quiet, Albert climbs on top of the carriage and hits anyone who sticks their head out with a large shovel.
Porter writes a note explaining the situation and places it in Harbottle''s empty ''medicine'' bottle. When they pass a large station, he throws the bottle through the window of the stationmaster''s office, alerting the authorities to their plight. The entire railway goes into action, with lines being closed and other trains re-routed so that Gladstone can finally crash into a siding where the waiting police force arrest the gun runners.
After a short-lived celebration, in which Harbottle points out that Gladstone is ninety years old and Porter claims it is good for another ninety, the engine explodes after its hectic journey, and Porter, Harbottle and Albert lower their hats in respect.','["Marcel Varnel"]','["Frank Launder","J.O.C.

Following the calm of the storm, the town crier Gabby stumbles across Gulliver in terror and rushes back to Lilliput to warn King Little of a "giant on the beach". But Little and King Bombo of Blefescu are signing a wedding contract between their children, Princess Glory and Prince David of Blefuscu, respectively. All is fine until an argument starts over which national anthem is to be played at the wedding. The argument cancels the wedding and starts a war.
After several failures, Gabby tells King Little of the "giant", and leads a mob to the beach to capture him. There, the Lilliputians tie Gulliver to a wagon on which they convey him to the capital. In the next morning, Gulliver awakens and breaks himself free; but when they see that the invading Blefuscuians are intimidated by his size, the Lilliputians enlist his help against their neighbor, treating him with hospitality and making him a new set of clothes.
King Bombo, who has sent three spies, Sneak, Snoop, and Snitch, into Lilliput, orders them to kill Gulliver, whereupon the spies steal Gulliver''s flintlock pistol, confiscated by the Lilliputians, and prepare to use it against him. Meanwhile, Gulliver learns of the war''s cause from Glory and David, and proposes a new song that combines the two proposed by their fathers.
When the spies assure King Bombo that they can kill Gulliver, Bombo announces by carrier pigeon that he will attack at dawn. Gabby intercepts this message and warns the Lilliputians, but is himself captured by the spies and stuffed in a sack, who prepare the pistol. As the Blefuscuian fleet approaches Lilliput, Gulliver ties them together and draws them disarmed to shore. The spies fire at Gulliver from a cliff, but Prince David diverts the shot and falls to his apparent death. Using David''s body to illustrate his point, Gulliver scolds both Lilliput and Blefuscu for fighting; when they solemnize a truce, Gulliver reveals that David is unharmed, whereupon David and Glory sing their combined song for everyone to hear. The spies release Gabby from the sack. Both sides thereafter build a new ship for Gulliver on which he departs.','["Dave Fleischer"]','["Jonathan Swift","Edmond Seward"]','["Jessica Dragonette","Lanny Ross","Pinto Colvig"]','["Animation","Adventure","Comedy","Family","Fantasy","Musical","Romance"]','6.7','["tt0033727","tt0076119","tt0115195","tt0053882","tt0032071","tt0000041","tt0029339","tt1320261","tt0489718","tt0027468","tt0025200","tt0030465"]','["animation"]','[{"url":"/gullivers_travels1939.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/gullivers_travels1939_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/gullivers_travels1939_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','gullivers_travels1939',540264,'Q246418','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Particularly notable scenes of both the rally and the film are images of Albert Speer''s lighting techniques during the 9th Nuremberg rally on 10 September 1937, in which he positioned 134 searchlights circling the Zeppelin field on which the rally was taking place. The beams of these spotlights, forming the "cathedral of light", merged into the general glow at an estimated height of 20,000 feet, and would be used for more practical purposes after war was declared in 1939.
The film is relatively short at only about 21 minutes compared with the longer Triumph des Willens and Der Sieg des Glaubens made by Leni Riefenstahl in 1934 and 1933 respectively. It adopts the same heavy style of adoration of Hitler with many scenes of marching SS men and Wehrmacht soldiers as well as navy personnel and flying aircraft overhead. With some prescience, scenes of soldiers parading in tanks and other vehicles (with guns firing) assume great prominence.

Casper then sees a flock of chickens who fly away with their hen house and splatter eggs on him.
Casper thinks that he made a mistake leaving home. When he hears a train whistle he decides to kill himself by having the train run over him, apparently forgetting that he is already dead. After the train passes over Casper without harming him, he begins crying. Casper is approached by a boy and a girl named Johnny and Bonnie who want to play with him, which makes Casper very happy.
After a game of ball and jump rope, Bonnie and Johnny introduce Casper to their mother, who screams and tells Casper to leave. Casper picks up his sack and is about to go through the door when a banker opens it. The banker orders Casper to tell the mother he has come for a mortgage payment, but when he realizes that Casper is a ghost, he tears up the mortgage which he tells Casper to keep because he doesn''t want to have a haunted house on the market and runs off in fright, so fast that he sets a bridge on fire.
Despondent, Casper decides to go back home to his own family. He is about to leave when the mother picks him up with a smile on her face, accepting him for saving her and the children from being forced to leave. The short concludes with the mother seeing Casper now wearing schoolboy clothes, Bonnie, and Johnny off to school together.','["Izzy Sparber"]','["Bill Turner","Otto Messmer"]','["Frank Gallop","Jack Mercer","Mae Questel"]','[""]','6.8','["tt0040871","tt6280432","tt0390954","tt1850374","tt0247960","tt0118824","tt0284946","tt0115128","tt0112642","tt1429551","tt0884322","tt0140883"]','["Classic cartoon; 1940s; Casper"]','[{"url":"/TheFriendlyGhost_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/TheFriendlyGhost_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','TheFriendlyGhost',64725,'Q7735302','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

He takes on pupils like Yves (Mikhail Rasumny) and young Arlette (Ginger Rogers) by testing their dishonesty. He takes Arlette even though she fails by only taking bread; she''s a runaway from a reform school where she''s supposed to stay until she turns 21.
Arlette decides to steal just enough to buy into a sham marriage to avoid the reform school. On her first try, however, a well-dressed man (Adolphe Menjou) catches her lifting his stick pin and brings her to his fancy house. He is an ambassador. When Baron Dvorak (Eduardo Ciannelli) arrives, the two agree to a scheme to take Arlette to a diplomatic reception posing as the baron''s niece.
It''s only when they arrive at the reception that Arlette is told that she is to steal the pocket watch of Pierre de Roche (Jean-Pierre Aumont). She does so while they are dancing, but removes a picture of the ambassador''s wife which is inside it (Mona Maris). The ambassador is thrilled to find no picture in the watch as he had been worrying his wife might be growing tired of him and has Arlette slip it back into Pierre''s pocket. Pierre insists on driving Arlette home and stops along the way to confess how much he likes her; he kisses her and gives her flowers from his garden before dropping her off at the baron''s house and extracts the promise that she''ll meet him at the train station the next day, as they are both (supposedly) going to Geneva, where she claims to attend boarding school.
Arlette then sneaks back to Aristide''s school but is confronted by the suspicious master thief, who throws her out when his suspicions that she was freelancing are confirmed. She decides to say goodbye to Pierre at the train station and confesses everything. Although he is angry and misses his train, he ultimately insists that she stay the night at his house and prepares a guest room for himself.
The next morning, Pierre''s penniless friend Roland (Melville Cooper) arrives to stay while Pierre is in Geneva. Pierre arranges for Roland to sham-marry Arlette in exchange for 10,000 francs. In Geneva, however, he quickly becomes jealous and returns, only to find that Arlette and Roland have hired Yves as a butler and bought clothes he must pay for. Arlette first tries to mollify Pierre and then flaunts her presence when the ambassador''s wife shows up. The woman storms out when she finds Arlette''s photo in Pierre''s watch, a trick that Pierre finds charming.
Pierre confesses to Roland that he is in love with Arlette, but Roland convinces him that his reputation would be ruined if he married her. However, Arlette gets cold feet and cannot go through with the wedding ceremony. Pierre refuses her attempts to make up and heads to another embassy reception. Yves explains the problem to Arlette, but the girl insists that the people whose opinion Pierre is worried about are themselves schemers, liars, and cheats and heads to the reception herself. Pierre has a final change of heart but returns to find her gone and races to the reception.
Pierre finds Arlette charming the minister (Henry Stephenson) and cuts in to ask Arlette to marry him. The baron agrees that gaining a niece is better than having her spill his and the ambassador''s secrets.

In court Eve meets a bail-bondsman, Gus Hoffman (Eddie Dunn), who bails her out of jail. They talk to about Eve''s background, where she mentions that her parents died when a theater collapsed somewhere twenty-three years ago, which makes Gus suspect that she is the rightful heir of the J.P. Sardam hair tonic empire and estate. There is a $1,000 reward for the one who finds the missing daughter of the Sardam spouses, who died during a Colorado theater collapse, which matches Eve''s age and story.
Hoffman talks to the lawyer handling the inheritance and reward, Thomas W. Campbell (Emmett Vogan), and he assures him that he indeed has found the missing child. The lawyer tells Hoffman that Eve will inherit millions of dollars. Hoffman brings the great news back to Eve, but her agent Mac warns her to trust Hoffman.
Eve is overjoyed by the news, and goes off to the Sardam estate to meet her relatives. She is presented to uncle Horace (Edward Keane), his wife Lavinia (Betty Blythe) and their daughter Millicent (Marilyn McConnell). When they hear that she has been an exotic dancer and even been arrested especially Aunt Lavinia treat her like something the cat dragged in. But before the upset Eve can leave the mansion, she happens upon her great aunt visiting from Wyoming, Sarah Birch (Janet Scott), who turns her mind around. Sarah finds the colorful Eve interesting enough to accept an invitation to the Club Cezanne in New York.
Eve gets a substantial advance on her inheritance and moves into an apartment that her uncle has rented for her. She persuades Sarah to come and live with her, and starts adapting to her new way of life, spending money on clothes and lessons in French. With the inheritance case still pending in court, Hoffman starts worrying about getting his share of the money and talks to her agent Mac about an immediate payment.
Eve is asked by the Sardam''s to perform at an upcoming upscale charity fundraiser, and she rehearses a pretentious Shakespeare piece to blow her audience away. Her efforts result in the audience laughing at her performance and she leaves the stage ashamed and humiliated. After the show she is offered $10,000 as compensation if she retracts her claim in the court, and is even more upset. She goes up on the stage again and performs one of her usual exotic dances, and now the audience is spellbound and impressed.
Once Eve comes back to her apartment, Hoffman is there with Mac, demanding his share of the inheritance money. They struggle and Hoffman holds Mac at gunpoint. When Mac tries to take the gun, a shot fires and Hoffman is killed. Mac quickly flees the scene, leaving Eve alone in the apartment with the body.
Eve is arrested for murdering Hoffman, but Mac eventually turns himself in and confesses to the killing. Campbell comes to the rescue, informing the police about Hoffman''s previous conviction for forgery. Mac is released from jail for acting in self-defence and it turns out that Hoffman had forged the papers  that say Eve is the heir of the Sardam estate.
Still, both Sarah and Horace are convinced that Eve is the rightful heir, despite Hoffman''s antics, and accept her claim. However, Eve decides to withdraw the claim entirely and move with Sarah to Wyoming. She changes her mind when Mac tells her that he has been in love with her the whole time and asks her to marry him.','["Don Brodie"]','["Harry O.

Lestrade, Holmes, and Watson learn nothing conclusive in questioning the other passengers, and Holmes is pushed out of the train, nearly to his death, but climbs back into the day coach and discovers a secret compartment in the coffin carrying Miss Vedder''s mother. He suspects that one of the people on the train is the notorious jewel thief Colonel Sebastian Moran.
Upon further questioning, Miss Vedder admits that a man paid her to transport the coffin. As Watson and Duncan-Bleek join the group, Holmes reveals that he swapped the diamond with an imitation while examining it. Lestrade ostensibly takes possession of the real diamond.
In the luggage compartment, Holmes and Watson find a train guard murdered with a poisoned dart. Meanwhile, a street criminal named Sands (Skelton Knaggs) incapacitates the conductor. Sands was hidden inside the coffin, and is in cahoots with Duncan-Bleek, who is, in fact, Colonel Moran. Sands and Moran go to Lestrade''s room, where Sands knocks Lestrade unconscious and steals the diamond from him; but Moran double-crosses Sands, shooting him dead with the same dart gun he used to kill Roland and the guard.
The train makes an unexpected stop to pick up several Scottish policemen, led allegedly by Inspector McDonald (Boyd Davis). Holmes informs McDonald that Duncan-Bleek is really Moran, and McDonald arrests Moran and finds the diamond in his vest, but Moran seizes a policeman''s gun and pulls the emergency cord to stop the train. During a scuffle in which the lights are turned off, Holmes subdues and handcuffs Moran, then secretly hides him under a table. When the lights are turned on again, the officers leave the train with Lestrade, his coat covering his face, believing he is Moran. As the train departs, Lestrade captures the thieves in the railway station, and Holmes reveals to Watson and Moran that he recognized McDonald as an impostor and recovered the diamond from him during the fight.','["Roy William Neill"]','["Frank Gruber","Arthur Conan Doyle"]','["Basil Rathbone","Nigel Bruce","Alan Mowbray"]','["Crime","Drama","Film-Noir","Mystery","Thriller"]','6.9','["tt0038494","tt0038008","tt0038259","tt0035317","tt0037303","tt0037794","tt0036348","tt0037168","tt0036349","tt0035318","tt0037248","tt0031022"]','["Mystery;Sherlock Holmes"]','[{"url":"/Terror_By_Night.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Terror_By_Night_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/Terror_By_Night_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','Terror_By_Night',96605,'Q2651105','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

As they wake up one morning, having improvised a variety of methods to keep warm in their beds, she orders them to get to their chores or face a beating and no breakfast. Her husband, the kindly old Cap, serves as the children''s schoolteacher. He promises them that once his back pension comes in, he will take them away from the school so they can all live well. 
The children milk a cow using a vacuum cleaner, but their dog Pete knocks over the bucket. To avoid punishment, they mix powdered plaster of Paris into a bucket of water so that the headmistress will think it is milk. At breakfast, they pass the word among themselves not to drink the milk, making up an excuse that it has spoiled. When Spanky innocently tells the headmistress, she scolds the children and orders them to put the milk on their mush and eat it. The plaster quickly sets up, leaving them with slabs of plaster and mush in their bowls and stuck on their spoons. 
Cap leads the children through a class session of humorously inaccurate questions and answers, then has them put on an impromptu talent show that culminates in Tommy belting out a rendition of "Just Friends" with adult-oriented lyrics. Spanky answers a telephone call during class; it is Mr. Brown, the bank manager, who wants to speak to Cap. Following a comical exchange, Mr. Brown gets Spanky to put Cap on the line and tells him that his back pension has come in, totaling nearly $4,000. Cap, ecstatic, treats the children to an amusement park visit, a wide variety of toys, and dinner at a fancy French restaurant. He orders a meal for everyone, not knowing exactly what it is. The food turns out to be mush, which the children throw in the waiter''s face out of disgust.','["Robert F.

Annexed to the nightclub is Merkl Hotel, a brothel to which the women of the nightclub bring their clients. The film follows the lives of two women from the same poor neighborhood, as they try to better themselves during the period of Austrian postwar hyperinflation. They are Marie, who becomes a prostitute, and Grete, who at the last moment, is saved from this fate.
Marie, in love with a young banker assistant, Egon Stirner, believes him to be unfaithful, and falsely accuses him of murder, all the while knowing the true identity of the murderer, from having witnessed it herself.
At the finale, Else, a wife and mother, who previously provided sexual favors to the butcher for meat, kills the butcher because he refuses her any more meat. The poor of the neighborhood, hearing the sounds of the nightclub, revolt against the clients by throwing stones. The nightclub burns down killing Else and her husband in the attic, but not before allowing them to ease their infant safely to the waiting poor. Only Grete seems to have any hope of leaving Melchiorgasse, and this because of her relationship with an American Red Cross officer.','["Georg Wilhelm Pabst"]','["Hugo Bettauer","F.H.

He organizes an expedition of scientists and has them use a large atomic-powered tank-like boring machine, called the Cyclotram, capable of drilling down deep through the Earth''s surface in order to find an underground environment where humanity could escape and survive a future nuclear holocaust.
The expedition (Jim Bannon, Marilyn Nash, Otto Waldis, Tom Handley, and Dick Cogan) begins after government funding has fallen through, and they are bailed out at the last minute by private funding from a newspaper heir (Bruce Kellogg), who insists on going with them as a lark. Romantic rivalry soon develops between Bannon and Kellogg for Nash, and during the dangerous underground expedition two lives are lost to the perils of their adventure.
In the end the scientists accomplish their goal and find an enormous underground expanse with a plentiful air supply, its own large ocean, and phosphorescent light. However, all the lab rabbits brought with them give birth to dead offspring. Through autopsies, it is discovered that this strange underground world has somehow rendered the rabbits, and hence any other life form, sterile. Dr. Morley is deeply depressed by this news. When an underground volcano suddenly erupts, he fails to enter the safety of the Cyclotram and quickly perishes.
The Cyclotram, carrying the remaining survivors, enters the underground ocean to avoid the eruption. They soon find themselves rising toward the surface of the upper world, having been caught up in a strong, upward-moving ocean current. They eventually break the surface near an unknown tropical island.','["Terry O.

Before Karnes can return to the United States, a real-life example of his concern materializes when a fisherman in Looe, Cornwall is killed on the beach, and his dying word is "behemoth". Later, thousands of dead fish are washed ashore.
Karnes and Bickford travel to Cornwall to investigate the fisherman''s death and, although his injuries seem to include radiation burns, they find no evidence of radiation on the beach. Then, Karnes goes to inspect a passenger ship found wrecked and badly damaged, with the loss of all on board. Back in London, the two scientists discover that samples of the dead fish contain large amounts of radioactive contamination. Karnes begins to suspect that the "behemoth" that the fisherman described seeing is some kind of large marine mammal that has mutated as a result of being contaminated by nuclear testing.
The next attack is on a farm near the coast in Essex. A photo of the area reveals a huge footprint and paleontologist Dr. Sampson identifies the creature as a Paleosaurus, an aquatic dinosaur that emits an electric pulse, like an electric eel. Karnes believes that the dinosaur is saturated by radiation, which is transmitted by the electric pulse, resulting in the burns seen on the fisherman and other victims. The radiation is also slowly killing the dinosaur. According to Dr. Samson, the dying creature will leave the ocean depths to head upstream, seeking out the shallow waters where it was born, but death by radiation may not come soon enough to prevent the creature from wreaking havoc on London along the way.
Karnes and Bickford try to persuade authorities to close the River Thames, but the military officer believes that their radar tracking systems will be enough to detect the behemoth and prevent it from getting near the city. Unfortunately, the dinosaur appears to be invisible to radar. Dr. Sampson and some other scientists spot it from a Royal Navy helicopter, but the radar equipment tracking the helicopter sees no sign of the beast, which destroys the helicopter when it gets too close. Soon, the behemoth surfaces in the Thames and capsizes the Woolwich Ferry.
Rising from the river, the creature rampages through the city, flattening cars and destroying buildings. Bickford and Karnes advise the military that the best way to kill the beast will be to administer a dose of radium, hoping to accelerate the radiation sickness that is already slowly killing it. While they prepare the dose, the behemoth continues its rampage, eventually plummeting through London Bridge back into the Thames.
Karnes and Bickford set their plan into action. A mini-sub with Karnes carries a torpedo filled with radium into the Thames in pursuit of the monster. During an initial pass, the behemoth takes a bite out of the mini-sub, but Karnes convinces the submarine captain to have another go. This time, they succeed in firing the torpedo into the monster''s mouth, and the behemoth roars in pain. Observers in helicopters later confirm the monster''s demise. 
As Karnes and Bickford climb into a car to leave the area, they hear a radio report of dead fish washing up on the eastern shores of the United States.',NULL,'["Robert Abel","Allen Adler"]','["Gene Evans","André Morell","Leigh Madison"]','["Action","Adventure","Drama","Fantasy","Horror","Sci-Fi","Thriller"]','5.8','["tt0045546","tt0067862","tt0485701","tt0346898","tt0054938","tt0065163","tt0420158","tt0167115","tt0090233","tt0050084","tt0128164","tt2665940"]','["movie trailers; horror; ''50s London; monsters; creature features"]','[{"url":"/TheGiantBehemothTrailer.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/TheGiantBehemothTrailer_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','TheGiantBehemothTrailer',958,'Q3418812','wp',NULL,'["Douglas Hickox","Eugène Lourié"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Curtains are removed from the windows to reveal bars.  The group is in a prison to witness the execution of hard core murderer Nick Ross (Ralf Harolde).  Ross is told there has been no commutation of his execution.  Having never given a confession, Ross proceeds to tell the crowd of the true events of what happened as his benefactor promised him his release; but then falls over dead, the victim of a poison dart.
District Attorney Roger Phillips (Ricardo Cortez) conduct a search of the occupants of the room and together with his girlfriend crime reporter Geri Reynolds  (Joan Woodbury) and his young receptionist Tommy George P. Breakston solve the murder and the criminal mastermind behind Ross.
Roger searches everyone in the room for the murder weapon, then has everyone return to the same seats in which they sat before Ross''s murder.
Roger becomes suspicious of an elderly man named Lanning, Ross''s character witness, because he has a cigarette holder which could be used as a dart blower. Lanning proclaims his innocence but is arrested.
Reporter Geri Reynolds, meanwhile, is sent to the prison, and Roger asks her to get acquainted with Lowell King, a parole board appointee. After Roger is reprimanded for arresting Lanning, whom he admits is an unlikely suspect, he asks Geri to interview Ross''s girl friend, Verne Drake.
Verne defends her former boyfriend, but admits that he made a phone call from her apartment on the day of the murder. Verne only remembers part of the number, and shortly after Geri leaves, Verne gets a threatening phone call.
Roger sends police detective Collins to watch Verne, and recognizes the telephone number as King''s. Roger is then mystified by a code written on the back of King''s business card, and asks Tommy, a switchboard operator who wants to be a detective, to decipher it.
Roger questions King and he denies knowing Ross. But his butler, Gordon, admits to having placed bets with Ross.
Verne, meanwhile, plans to leave town and demands that J. Reed, the head of an organization which opposes capital punishment, return the money she gave him to obtain Ross''s release. Reed, who was at the execution, accompanies Verne to the bank, but she dies suddenly after honking the car horn.
Collins catches Reed when he runs, and Roger later discovers a poisoned dart embedded in the steering wheel that matches the one that killed Ross. Roger arrests Reed and frees Lanning.
One evening, Geri and Bates, a fellow reporter, dine at Garrick''s café, where Geri''s check is refused. King comes in shortly after and, because he is friendly with Garrick, offers to help.
A waiter accepts King''s check and takes it to Garrick''s office. Garrick burns King''s check, and gives the waiter a roll of money. King then gives the money to Geri, but still pays her bill.
Later, while waiting for Roger at his office, Geri realizes that the code on King''s business card is for a library book. As Tommy is asking the investigative department to find out about the book, Geri accidentally drops her purse. Geri and Tommy are shocked to discover five $500 bills in her wallet, sandwiched between two one-dollar bills.
When Roger returns, Tommy tells him what transpired. King becomes Roger''s new suspect after he learns that a library book on toxicology was checked out by Gordon. Tommy arranges for Roger and Bates to listen in on a telephone conversation between Garrick and King, who are partners in a protection racket, during which they hear that Garrick believed the money was intended for King.
At that moment, King reveals that Geri is with him, and Roger, Bates and Collins rush to his house. Roger bursts into King''s office just as he is about to kill Geri with a poisoned dart. King confesses to the murders of both Ross and Verne, then tries to kill Roger. However, Geri knocks King out with a vase, and Bates and Collins capture Garrick and his thugs. Roger and Geri embrace, and Roger asks her to join his staff permanently.','["Phil Rosen"]','["Henry Bancroft","Leonard Fields"]','["Ricardo Cortez","Joan Woodbury","Pat Gleason"]','["Mystery"]','5.8','["tt0043646","tt0028358","tt0031149","tt0031147","tt0044673","tt0031055","tt0038346","tt0038409","tt0040472","tt0035570","tt0041700","tt0047263"]','["murder;mystery;feature films"]','[{"url":"/IKilledThatMan1945.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/IKilledThatMan1945_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/IKilledThatMan1945_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','IKilledThatMan1945',11184,'Q5977772','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Shortly after taking off, the ship is struck by an unknown object, forcing Corcoran to abort the mission and land. However, the equipment cannot handle the fast descent back into the atmosphere and the ship crash lands in the woods, killing Corcoran. Dave Randall (Ed Nelson) and Donna Bixby (Georgianna Carter), two technicians from a nearby space agency tracking station, locate the crashed ship and recover Corcoran''s body. They are baffled, however, by what appears to be a giant tear in the side of the destroyed spacecraft and a mud-like substance covering some of the wreckage. Randall and Bixby are joined by lead scientist Dr. Alex Wyman (Tyler McVey), technician Steve Dunlap (John Baer) and physician Julie Benson (Angela Greene), who was also Corcoran''s fiancee. Wyman observes that Corcoran''s body exhibits no signs of rigor mortis, and that the blood pooling beside him is not livid as it should be. The team brings the corpse back to their lab to run tests and find further irregularities. Although the body lacks a heartbeat or pulse, it maintains the blood pressure of a living human being. After looking at his blood in a microscope, they find unusual, unidentifiable cells that seem resistant to destruction from human white blood cells.
The team tries to call for further assistance, but find the radio is no longer working. Randall heads outside to check the power transformers, and is attacked by a large creature (Ross Sturlin) hiding in the underbrush around the station. Randall fires a few shots at the creature with his pistol and escapes unscathed. Although he did not get a good look at the creature, he describes it to the rest of the team as similar in size to a bear. Later, the team finds the infirmary has been trashed and Corcoran''s body is gone. They initially believe the creature has broken in and stole the corpse, but are shocked to instead find Corcoran has mysteriously regained consciousness. Upon checking his blood again, there is no trace of the mysterious cells from before, but after investigating Corcoran''s body, they find the cells have changed into lizard-like fetuses and entered into his abdominal cavity. The creature later breaks into the lab again, this time beheading Dr. Wyman. Randall and Dunlap are initially suspicious that Corcoran was involved in the death, which he denies, but it appears he has some sort of telepathic connection with the creature. Despite Wyman''s death, Corcoran does not believe the creature is evil, but rather simply misunderstood. He implores the others to give the creature a chance to explain its actions, and asks that they not condemn it as a monster simply because it is different.
As the others plot to destroy the creature with improvised gas bombs and flares, Corcoran flees the station and finds the creature in a nearby cave. After consuming Wyman''s brain, the creature is now able to speak with the scientist''s voice and has absorbed his knowledge. Corcoran asks whether Wyman''s death was needed, but the creature insists it was a necessary sacrifice. The others arrive to destroy the creature, but hesitate because Corcoran will not step aside and let them throw their bombs. The creature insists it is not an evil monster, but an intelligent alien who has come to Earth to save the human race from its own self-destructive tendencies. It explains that Corcoran''s body has been implanted with its embryos, which will allow the alien species to multiply and take over the human race, which the creature claims is the only way to truly save humanity. Upon realizing the creature is forcing the will of its species on the human race, Corcoran concludes the creature is evil after all and commits suicide so its embryos cannot come to fruition. The others then throw their explosives and kill the creature, which in its dying breaths warns that others from his species are waiting in space and will return one day to conquer humanity.','["Bernard L.

He wishes to marry his daughter, Princess Gloria (Vivian Reed), to an old courtier named Googly-Goo (Arthur Smollett), but she is in love with Pon, the Gardener''s boy (Todd Wright). Krewl employs the Wicked Witch named Mombi (Mai Wells), to freeze the heart of Gloria so she will not love Pon any longer. This she does by pulling out her heart (which looks somewhere between a valentine and a bland representation of a heart without any vessels) and coating it with ice. Meanwhile, a lost little girl from Kansas named Dorothy Gale (Violet MacMillan), is captured by Mombi and imprisoned in her castle. However, Dorothy runs away with the now heartless Gloria, accompanied by Pon and eventually meet the Scarecrow (Frank Moore). Mombi catches up with the travelers and removes the Scarecrow''s stuffing, but Dorothy and Pon are able to re-stuff him; Gloria abandons them and wanders off.
They meet the lost little boy, Button-Bright (Mildred Harris). The party travels to the Winkie Country next and arrives at the Tin Castle of the Tin Woodman (Pierre Couderc), who has rusted solid. (The Tin Woodman resides in a Tin Castle in later Oz novels, beginning in The Emerald City of Oz'''' (1910). Mombi reaches the Tin Castle, and the Tin Woodman chops off her head; however, this merely slows her down as she hunts for it and places it back on. (The Wicked Witch of the East in The Tin Woodman of Oz is later described as having done a similar thing to him when he was still human.) Having replaced her head, Mombi encounters Pon and turns him into a kangaroo.
Dorothy, Button-Bright, the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman escape from Mombi by crossing a river on a raft. As in the original novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900), the Scarecrow''s barge-pole gets stuck in the river bed and leaves him stranded, until he is rescued by a bird. At one point in this sequence, the Scarecrow slides down the pole into the river, resulting a brief "underwater" sequence featuring puppet fish and a mermaid; throughout, the Scarecrow makes asides to the camera, mostly without intertitles. (At another point, the frozen Gloria even makes a malevolent stare directly into the camera.)
The party encounters the Wizard (J. Charles Haydon), who tricks Mombi by letting the group hide in the Red Wagon, pulled by the sawhorse; when Mombi attempts to follow them, the group escape out the back of the wagon. The four companions meet the Cowardly Lion, who joins them. The Wizard traps Mombi in a container of "Preserved Sandwitches" and paints out the "sand" and the plural, carrying her away in his pocket. The Scarecrow, taking a barrage of arrows, tosses Krewl''s soldiers over the battlements to deal with the Cowardly Lion, who cannot climb the rope ladder over the city wall. With the support of the people, the Scarecrow is easily able to depose King Krewl. The Wizard releases Mombi, and compels her to restore Pon to his normal form and unfreeze Gloria''s heart.','["J.

Mavis desires revenge after a few gang members attacked her home and shot and killed her father. One of her only friends is geologist and school teacher John Burnham (Fred Warren). He suggests she get an education instead of learning to use a gun.
Chief Honeycutt visits Mavis'' widowed mother Martha Hawn (Claire McDowell) and flirts with her. Meanwhile, Mavis is fishing at a pond near her home with Jason. He reveals his stepfather is manipulating Martha into granting him her land. When a group of planters and capitalists come to town intending to exploit mountain coal lands, Mavis scares them away with her gun. She and Jason later run into the rich aristocrat Gray Pendleton (John Gilbert) and his sweetheart Marjorie Lee (Betty Bouton), who are looking for the town.
Back at home, Mavis is disappointed Steve is still there. Later that night, Mavis visits a party and meets Gray for the second  time. He flirts with her, which makes Jason jealous. Gray forces himself up to Mavis, which makes her upset and angry. She leaves the party and finds out her mother has left her to marry Steve. She decides to marry as well and proposes to Jason. However, they soon find out they are too young.
When word hits town that a man named Morton Sanders (Henry Hebert) is planning to take over the city, some of the inhabitants, including Mavis, threaten him to force him go away. Later that night, Morton is found dead and the police are looking for everyone who was involved. The police visits the Hawn house, but Mavis'' grandfather (Fred Huntley) forces them to go away. While holding them off with his shotgun, Mavis packs her things and goes to hide in the forest. The next day, John Burnham visits her and convinces her to go to trial to prove her innocence.
In court, the lawyer of the other party demands for her to be hanged. The town folks try to defend her by all admitting they have shot Morton. Mavis is discharged and finally decides to go to school. Mr. Burnham, Gray and Marjorie are all pleased with Mavis'' decision. Jason however, becomes jealous again when she starts hanging out with Gray at school and leaves her.
Six years pass. Mavis has been adopted by the rich Colonel Pendleton (W.H. Bainbridge). One day she receives a letter from her mother, announcing she is getting old and will most likely die soon. She decides to visit her mother and finds out Steve killed her father. He has become violent and takes it out on Martha. Mavis tries to help her and shoots Steve.

At one point, his gang accosts the broken-down car of a music business executive, Harry Bayliss. Afterward Bayliss wishes to call a tow truck, so he goes into the diner where Eddy''s gang is celebrating. Bayliss overhears Eddy singing to the jukebox and offers him a chance to audition for his variety program. Eddy accepts, passes his audition, and is given a spot on television. Eddy sings a two-minute song that is apparently stupendously successful, with Bayliss calling Eddy an "overnight sensation" and prophesying an astounding rise to fame, complete with a hit record, "a guest spot on every top show," and eventually culminating with "The Eddy Crane Show." Atop Eddy''s newfound success, he also immediately begins making advances at Bayliss''s secretary, Helen Tracy, in preference over his long-suffering girlfriend, Iris.
The specter of Eddy''s stardom raises dissension among his gang, who wish either to accompany him unquestionably on his ascent, or to hold him back in their ranks. Iris is also jealous of Helen, with whom Eddy has been carrying on an affair. Helen eventually professes her love for Eddy. But one of Eddy''s gang members, Moon, kills a fat barkeep, threatening to drag Eddy down by association. Moon runs from the police, but is tracked down by Eddy, who delivers him for arrest. With this he also definitively separates himself from the rest of his gang and from Iris, but also destroys his prospects for a career as a singer with his own arrest.','["Paul Frees"]',NULL,'["Tony Travis","Karen Kadler","Peter Breck"]','["Crime"]','2.3','["tt0055452","tt0053213","tt0038387","tt0053240","tt0370334","tt0056415","tt0034613","tt0093872","tt0049363","tt0089280","tt0218032","tt0058615"]','["crime, drama"]','[{"url":"/the_beatniks.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/the_beatniks_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/the_beatniks_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','the_beatniks',37432,'Q1997337','wp','["Paul Frees"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

She starts undressing in the advertising office of a very puzzled Jim Trevor. When she finally realizes he is not a photographer, she storms out.
Nicole is locked out of her room by her landlady for being behind on her rent, but her friend Gloria helps her out by paying the arrears. Gloria suggests she try to snare a rich husband. Gloria is good friends with Mike, the head waiter at the ritzy Savoy Grand Hotel, so she tries to get him to hire Gloria. Mike has no openings, but mentions that he has saved $3000 to open a restaurant. He needs another $2000, so Gloria convinces him to finance a scheme to have Gloria attract the attention of Bill Duncan, a regular hotel guest who "owns half of Canada". Nicole and Gloria settle into a suite across the hall from Bill''s. 
The plan hits a snag when Bill''s good friend Jim Trevor recognizes her. Jim demands she tell Bill the truth. She agrees, but reneges. When Jim tells Bill, Bill does not believe him, as they have both lied before to steal each other''s girlfriends. Jim blackmails Nicole into dining with him and gets her to confess that she needs $3000 in front of his butler Rigley. He departs to inform Bill, but she escapes Rigley''s custody and gets to Bill first. When Bill introduces Nicole to his family, Jim brings Rigley to the reception, but Bill remains unconvinced and punches Jim in the jaw. Ashamed, Nicole follows after Jim and offers to confess all, but he does not believe her. She gets into Jim''s car to see if he has been injured. He then drives off with her, taking her to his isolated country retreat, where his caretaker mistakes her for his new wife.
That night, Nicole confesses to Jim that she has fallen in love with him, but he only asks her when she found out he is richer than Bill. She slips out and hitches a ride back to New York.
Bill finally discovers the truth and becomes worried about a breach of promise lawsuit. Mike promises to get Nicole to leave the country ... in exchange for his money back ($5000).

At a meeting headed by President Polehunter, "assisted by Secretary Rattlebrain, by the Archivist Mole, by the Vice-president Humbug, the members of the office, Easily-fooled, Daredevil, Schemer, etc., etc.," the members listen to Professor Daredevil''s plan for the world tour, but reject it for being out-of-date. The president then welcomes the eccentric engineer Crazyloff (in French, Mabouloff; "maboul" is French for "crazy" or "crackpot"), who explains his project for a new "impossible" voyage, using "all the known means locomotion—railroads, automobiles, dirigible balloons, submarine boats…" The unusual plan is accepted enthusiastically, and preparations begin.
When work is complete, the machines and travelers are loaded onto a train and are sent to the Swiss Alps, where the travelers will begin their journey. The first board an automobile, the Auto-Crazyloff, and journey through the mountains. In an attempt to run over the summit of the Rigi, the travelers crash at the bottom of a precipice. They are saved by mountaineers and rushed to a Swiss hospital.
After they have recovered, they board a train with their vehicles, and make a second attempt at running over a summit: this time, the Jungfrau. Getting higher and higher every minute, with dirigible balloons attached to the train, they rise into space and are swallowed by the Sun. The travelers land with a crash. They are happy to be alive, but the heat is too much. All but one of the travelers are loaded into an icebox but are suddenly frozen. The remaining traveler, Crazyloff himself, finds a bundle of straw among the debris and starts a fire to melt the ice. The travelers thaw and are happily moved over to the expedition''s submarine, which is launched off a cliff on the Sun, plummets through space, and falls into an ocean on Earth. 
After a few minutes of underwater travel, a boiler problem causes the submarine to explode. The travelers are thrown up into the air, landing safely at a seaport amid the wreckage of the submarine. They return in triumph to the Institute of Incoherent Geography, where a grand rejoicing is held for them.','["Georges Méliès"]','["Georges Méliès","Jules Verne"]','["Georges Méliès","Fernande Albany","Jehanne d''Alcy"]','[""]','7.6','["tt0000230","tt0000041","tt0004008","tt0000304","tt0000498","tt0242849","tt5858968"]','["Silent; Short; Georges Méliès"]','[{"url":"/The_Impossible_Voyage.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/The_Impossible_Voyage_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/The_Impossible_Voyage_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','The_Impossible_Voyage',33388,'Q2563734','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

An annoyed aristocratic fop, the Vicomte de Valvert (Albert Cavens), provokes him into a duel by tritely insulting Cyrano''s enormous nose. Cyrano first mocks his lack of wit, improvising numerous inventive ways in which Valvert could have phrased it (much to the amusement of the audience). He then composes a ballade for the occasion on the spot and recites it during the sword fight. With the last line, he stabs his opponent.
Cyrano''s friend Le Bret (Morris Carnovsky), Captain of the Gascony guards, warns him he has made powerful enemies of his victim''s friends, but he is unconcerned. When Le Bret presses him to reveal the real reason he hates Montfleury, Cyrano admits that he became jealous when he saw the actor smiling at his beautiful cousin Roxane (Mala Powers). He confesses that he is in love with her, but harbors no hope of it being returned because of his nose. When he receives a request from Roxane to see her in the morning, he is finally emboldened to act.
Then pastry chef and fellow poet Ragueneau (Lloyd Corrigan) approaches him for help. Ragueneau has learned that a nobleman he had mocked with his verses, the Comte De Guiche (Ralph Clanton), has hired a hundred ruffians to teach him a lesson. Cyrano escorts him, kills eight of the horde, and drives off the rest.
The next day, before he can tell Roxane of his feelings, she informs him that she has fallen in love with a handsome guardsman, Christian de Neuvillette (William Prince), though she has not even spoken to him. Cyrano hides his devastation and agrees to help her.
Cyrano befriends the young man, who is in Cyrano''s guardsmen unit, and discovers that he is infatuated with Roxane, but is too inept with words to woo her. To help him, Cyrano composes Christian''s love letters to Roxane, which she finds irresistible. Later, Christian decides he wants no more help and tries to speak to Roxane face to face, but fails miserably and she re-enters her house in an angry huff. Cyrano, hiding in the bushes, comes to his rescue, but this time by imitating Christian''s voice and speaking to Roxane from under her balcony. He is so eloquent that he (unintentionally) wins a kiss for Christian from Roxane.
When the arrogant Comte De Guiche, who is also wooing Roxane, pressures her to marry him, Cyrano delays him long enough for her to wed Christian instead. Furious, De Guiche, Christian''s commander, orders him to join his unit immediately for a war against the Spanish, preventing the couple from spending their wedding night together.
With Cyrano under his command as well, De Guiche earns the swordsman''s respect by his conduct in the war. From the field, Cyrano sends Roxane letters every day, supposedly written by Christian. Roxane visits her husband in camp and tells him that she now has fallen in love with him not merely for his looks but because of his words, and would love him even if he were ugly. Realizing that she really loves Cyrano, Christian gets his rival to agree to tell Roxane the truth and let her decide between them. But before the opportunity arises, Christian volunteers for a dangerous mission and is fatally wounded, silencing Cyrano.
Roxane enters a convent in mourning. Years pass, with Cyrano visiting Roxane weekly, having retired from the military and writes satirical articles mocking the nobility. De Guiche, who has also befriended her and has come to respect Cyrano, has overheard a courtier plotting against Cyrano. De Guiche warns Roxane that Cyrano''s life may be in danger. One night, Cyrano is lured into an ambush; the poet is run down by a carriage. Near death, he hides his injuries and goes to keep his appointment with Roxane for the last time. His secret love for Roxane is finally revealed when he recites from memory the last of his love letters, which she has kept, but it is too late. Cyrano first slips into delirium, then dies, leaving Roxane to mourn a second time.','["Michael Gordon"]','["Edmond Rostand","Brian Hooker"]','["José Ferrer","Mala Powers","William Prince"]','["Adventure","Drama","Romance"]','7.5','["tt0078256","tt8460480","tt8553192","tt2650642","tt0083872","tt0052016","tt0047876","tt8296592","tt0038824","tt1705113","tt3397160","tt0034746"]','["Drama"]','[{"url":"/Cyrano_DeBergerac_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/Cyrano_De_Bergerac.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Cyrano_De_Bergerac_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','Cyrano_DeBergerac',350184,'Q784181','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Esther goes to Hollywood and tries to land a job as an extra, but so many others have had the same idea that the casting agency has stopped accepting applications. Esther is told that her chances of becoming a star are one in 100,000. She befriends a new resident at her boarding house, assistant director Danny McGuire, himself out of work. When Danny and Esther go to a concert to celebrate Danny''s employment, Esther has her first encounter with Norman Maine, an actor she admires greatly. Norman has been a major star for years, but his alcoholism has sent his career into a downward spiral.
Danny gets Esther a one-time waitressing job at a fancy Hollywood party. While serving hors d’œuvres, she catches Norman''s eye. He gets his longtime producer and good friend, Oliver Niles, to give her a screen test. Impressed, Oliver gives her a new name ("Vicki Lester") and a contract. She practices her few lines for her first tiny role.
When the studio has trouble finding a female lead for Norman''s current film, entitled The Enchanted Hour, Norman persuades Oliver to cast Esther.  The film makes her an overnight success, even as viewers continue to lose interest in Norman.
Norman proposes to Esther; she accepts when he promises to give up drinking. They elope without publicity, much to press agent Matt Libby''s disgust, and enjoy a trailer-camping honeymoon in the mountains. When they return, Esther''s popularity continues to skyrocket, while Norman realizes his own career is over, despite Oliver''s attempts to help him. Norman stays sober for a while, but his frustration over his situation finally pushes him over the edge. He starts drinking again. When Esther wins the industry''s top award (the Academy Award for Best Actress), he interrupts her acceptance speech by drunkenly demanding three awards for the worst acting of the year and accidentally slapping her when he dramatically swings his arms back.
A stay at a sanatorium seems to cure Norman''s increasingly disruptive alcoholism, but a chance encounter with Libby gives the press agent an opportunity to vent his long-concealed contempt. Norman goes on a four-day drinking binge and winds up arrested for drunk driving. In court, the judge sentences him to 90 days of incarceration, but Esther pleads with the judge to put Norman under her care.  The judge, who is impressed with Esther''s acting success, suspends Norman''s sentence and puts Norman''s custody into Esther''s hands.  Esther decides to give up her career to devote herself to his rehabilitation. After Norman overhears her discussing her plan with Oliver, he drowns himself in the Pacific Ocean.
Shattered, Esther decides to quit and go home. Showing up soon afterward is her grandmother, who has heard Esther is quitting. Her grandmother tells her of a letter Norman sent her when they got married. The letter stated how proud he was of Esther and how much he loved her.

It is considered by some to be the first American avant-garde film. The primary objective of the film is to explore the relationship between photography and film; camera movement is kept to a minimum, as is incidental motion within each shot.

('tt0034756','free','Fresh Hare (1942)','1942','7min','In this short, the rotund early-1940s version of Elmer Fudd is portrayed as a Mountie, earnestly attempting to arrest Bugs Bunny, who is, according to several posters attached to forest trees, wanted dead or alive (preferably dead). After following the rabbit tracks to a burrow, Elmer tries to lure Bugs out with a carrot; this works, at least with Bugs'' hand, and Elmer initially succeeds in getting a handcuff around the rabbit''s wrist. Somehow, though, Bugs works his arm free of the cuff - out of sight in his burrow - and attaches a bomb in its place. Elmer, attached to the bomb via the other handcuff, panics when he pulls it from the burrow.  He frantically searches for his keys, only to find that Bugs has them and, leaning against a nearby tree, is nonchalantly twirling them around his finger while munching a carrot.  He then deliberately takes his time going through each and every key, and does not find the correct one until the moment the bomb explodes offscreen. Elmer, who remains completely unharmed, tells Bugs that he has been found guilty of committing a litany of crimes. The crimes, as corrected here for Elmer''s rounded-l-and-r speech, are listed below:
"Resisting an officer, assault and battery, trespassing, disturbing the peace, miscellaneous misdemeanors, public nuisance, traffic violations, going through a boulevard stop, jaywalking, triple parking, conduct unbecoming to a rabbit", and (once again) "violating traffic regulations." As Elmer reads, Bugs takes his Mountie hat and impersonates a superior officer: "Attention! Why, look at you! You call yourself a Mountie! You''re a disgrace to the regiment! I''m gonna drum you out of the service!" He then tears off Elmer''s uniform, right down to his polka-dot undershorts. 
When Elmer realizes he''s been tricked, he begins to give chase - after pausing to put his miraculously refurbished uniform. The chase eventually involves a path beneath the snow, which ends abruptly when Elmer runs into a pine tree. The impact causes all the snow to fall off the tree, which reveals Christmas decorations, and Elmer emerges from underneath with snow on his face that gives him a Santa Claus appearance. The song Jingle Bells plays in the background, and Bugs says to the astonished Elmer, "Merry Christmas, Santy!" and burrows his way out of Elmer''s path.
Elmer rediscovers Bugs''s footprints and follows them; he finds Bugs taunting a snow effigy of Elmer the Mountie. Bugs announces he is going to punch it square in the nose. Elmer has crept up behind Bugs and is tapping his foot, waiting to catch the rabbit by surprise. However, as Bugs finishes his wind-up for the punch, he turns around at the last moment and slugs the real Elmer square in the nose, propelling him backward into an ice-wall. Bugs again burrows away. 
After some more hijinks and another failed chase, a weeping Elmer Fudd gives up and labels himself as a "disgwace to the wegiment" for failing to catch the rabbit, at which point Bugs willingly turns himself in. At headquarters Bugs is blindfolded and sentenced to death by firing squad. As the firing squad prepares to execute Bugs, Elmer tells him that he can make one last wish, which prompts Bugs to say, "I wish, I wish," and to break into the song "Dixie". The scene then, in a non sequitur, transitions into a minstrel show (a commonly censored scene on televised airings of this short), where Elmer, Bugs and the firing squad, now all in blackface, perform the chorus of "Camptown Races", with Bugs on banjo and Elmer on tambourine.','["Friz Freleng"]',NULL,'["Mel Blanc","Arthur Q.

('tt0022883','free','The Fatal Glass of Beer (1933)','1933','18min','Ma and Pa Snavely live in a wooden hut in the Yukon. Many years before, their son Chester left for the big city and became involved in crime after "the fatal glass of beer". He returns home after getting out of prison, and promises his father not to tell his Mother what he really did. He makes the same promise to his Mother. They both chase him out of the house.
Pa Snavely, as portrayed by Fields, serenades a Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer with "The Fatal Glass of Beer", a mournful song detailing the evils of foul drink and bad companions in the big city. A zither accompaniment recorded for the film seldom matches the vocal, because Fields subtly changes keys when the zither does not, resulting in a humorously off-key effect.
Fields emphasizes the stagey satire by striking various poses and being overly theatrical with the dialogue. The most famous gag has Fields opening the cabin door periodically and exclaiming, "And it ain''t a fit night out for man or beast!", with some obviously fake snow thrown into his face a moment later. He would reprise that gag during the "play-within-the-play" in The Old Fashioned Way (1934).','["Clyde Bruckman"]',NULL,'["W.C.

Following the American Civil War, peace is maintained in the New Mexico Territory by Fort Invicible, a fortification set up outside a mountain pass that blocks marauding bands of Apache.  The Apache are able to eventually take the fort by cutting off its water supply, then assaulting the fort when its garrison is at its weakest and killing all the defenders.
Captain Lance arrives with a patrol soon after the battle and captures Tucsos, the charismatic leader of the Apache.  Lance''s scout advises the captain to kill Tucsos, but Lance will not shoot a prisoner.
Back at the headquarters of the 5th Cavalry, the invalid commanding officer orders Lance to assign an officer to command an escort to take Tucsos to a larger post. Lance decides to lead the patrol himself, but at the last minute, the colonel says he needs Lance to stay at the fort in case of an Apache attack, and orders him to assign another (but more popular) officer, Lieutenant Holloway, to lead the small group of men escorting Tucsos.  The Apache free Tucsos and Lieutenant Holloway ends up dead. The men at the fort blame Captain Lance, unaware of the colonel''s order. They believe that his decision to assign Lieutenant Holloway to the dangerous mission was for a personal reason (both officers were vying for the affection of the same woman). The woman believes it too, and bitterly breaks up with him.
Lance''s standing with the soldiers at the fort only gets worse when he assembles a group of misfit cavalrymen to hold off the rampaging Indians at the ruins of Fort Invincible, which is considered a suicide mission.','["Gordon Douglas"]','["Edmund H.

In his nearby laboratory, Dr. Lorenzo Cameron (George Zucco) draws blood from a caged wolf. Secured to a table is Dr. Cameron''s simpleminded but strong gardener, Petro (Glenn Strange), who is to be the subject of the doctor''s experiment. Cameron injects a serum made from a wolf''s blood into the cooperative Petro, who loses consciousness, grows fur and fangs, and awakens after he has transformed into a wolfman.
Cameron turns to an empty table, visualizing his former colleagues sitting there: The four professors dismissed his theory that wolf blood transfusions could be used to give a human being wolf-like traits. He recalls how the scientific community, the press, and the public joined in a resounding chorus of ridicule that finally cost him his position at the university.
Addressing the four spectral professors, Cameron declares, "Right now, we''re at war, at war with an enemy that produces a horde that strikes with a ferocious fanaticism". Cameron proposes giving wolfman traits to our soldiers in order to help win the war. When the professors scoff, Cameron says to them that his proposal doesn''t really matter; he is going to have his wolfman kill them one-by-one. For the time being, however, he administers an antidote that transforms Petro back to normal; Petro remembers nothing.
The following night, Cameron injects Petro again and sends him into the swamp. As a wolfman, he enters a nearby home and kills a little girl. Hearing about the child''s death, Cameron knows his formulation works. Now he can proceed to eliminate his former colleagues. He begins by setting up elaborate encounters, in which Petro, left alone with each scientist, makes his wolfman transformation. The more times this happens, however, the more unpredictable he becomes while killing them.
Cameron''s daughter Lenora (Anne Nagel) is romantically involved with Tom Gregory (Johnny Downs), a newspaper reporter investigating the death of the little girl. As the professors are killed, Gregory begins to suspect that Cameron is behind the murders.
The principals arrive at the Cameron home as a large thunderstorm begins. A bolt of lightning suddenly strikes, setting Cameron''s laboratory on fire. Lenora and Tom are able escape from the spreading fire after first encountering an agitated Petro, now in his wolfman form. The transformed Petro suddenly turns on Cameron and kills him, as the raging fire brings down the house on both of them.','["Sam Newfield"]',NULL,'["Johnny Downs","George Zucco","Anne Nagel"]','["Drama","Horror","Romance","Sci-Fi"]','3.3','["tt0035784","tt0037084","tt0033760","tt0037441","tt0035640","tt0037711","tt0038937","tt0035679","tt0032390","tt0033283","tt0049013","tt0054691"]','["horror"]','[{"url":"/mad_monster.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/mad_monster_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/mad_monster_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','mad_monster',44768,'Q2032655','wp','["Fred Myton"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Benton''s corpse is subjected to chemical injection and massive jolts of high-voltage electricity in order to study the effect on human tissues. But Benton''s heart is restimulated and he completely revives (though rendered mute due to electrical damage to his vocal cords), immensely strong and with skin virtually impervious to scalpels, police bullets, even to bazooka shells.
After killing the doctor and his assistant (Joe Flynn), Benton sets out to avenge himself on his two henchmen and his attorney (Ross Elliott) who, in collusion with the attorney, had betrayed Benton in order to steal his loot. Benton had left the location of his stash to his stripper-girlfriend (Marian Carr), who had since gone straight and begun dating the detective who brought Benton to justice, after she had rejected the lawyer''s own advances.
The story then follows Benton''s revenge on his enemies; the police who first learn of a wave of mysterious killings, then of Benton''s reanimation; and the developing relationship between the detective and the stripper. The lawyer, fearing for his life after the two henchman are murdered, confesses the plot to the police, and reveals that Benton had always used the sewer system to evade detection; and to find a hiding place for the money, as it turns out.
Tracked down by the police, Benton takes a direct hit in the solar plexus from a bazooka, and is heavily burned by a flame thrower. Weakened, he flees to a power station, where he climbs atop a gantry, inadvertently setting it in motion.  As he watches the actions of the police down below, he fails to notice that the gantry is moving toward the main transformer.  A dangling hook comes too close to one of the terminals, and the other transformers erupt in sparks. as hundreds of thousands of volts surge throughout its metal frame, searing Benton to ashes. On a quiet night a few days later, Chasen successfully proposes to his girlfriend.','["Jack Pollexfen"]','["Vy Russell","Sue Dwiggins"]','["Lon Chaney Jr.","Max Showalter","Marian Carr"]','["Crime","Horror","Sci-Fi"]','4.0','["tt0052646","tt0034613","tt0024727","tt0036653","tt0052969","tt0033787","tt0052846","tt0056983","tt0033760","tt0071276","tt0075342","tt0068502"]',NULL,'[{"url":"/indestructible_man.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/indestructible_man_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/indestructible_man_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','indestructible_man',64838,'Q2860520','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The guests are test pilot Lance Schroeder (Richard Long), newspaper columnist Ruth Bridges (Julie Mitchum), psychiatrist Dr. David Trent (Alan Marshal) who specializes in hysteria, Nora Manning (Carolyn Craig) who works for one of Loren''s companies, and the house''s owner Watson Pritchard (Elisha Cook). All are strangers to both the Lorens and each other, with their only commonality a desperate need for money.

The Lorens have a tense relationship; Frederick is convinced Annabelle tried to poison him in order to acquire his wealth, which Annabelle firmly denies, attributing his suspicions to paranoia and jealousy. Watson believes that the house is genuinely haunted by the ghosts of those murdered there, including his own brother. He gives a tour of the house, including a vat of acid in the basement which was used by a previous resident to kill his wife. When Lance and Nora remain behind to further explore the basement, Lance is locked in an empty room and struck on the head, while Nora is confronted by a menacing ghost.
Annabelle privately warns Lance that her husband is scheming something, and that she suspects him of murdering his second and third wives. Gathering downstairs, the guests are told the rules of the party, and each is given a .45 ACP caliber pistol for protection. Having encountered further apparitions, Nora decides against staying the night, but the caretakers lock the doors five minutes early, taking that option out of the guests'' hands.
Lance is confronted by Nora, who tells him an unseen assailant strangled her and left her for dead. In light of Annabelle''s warnings, they both suspect Frederick. He tells her to remain out of sight so that her attacker will still think her dead. Hearing a scream, Lance and David find Annabelle''s corpse, suspended to suggest she hanged herself, but the absence of a perch immediately arouses suspicions of murder. To survive the night, Lance and David propose that everyone stay in their rooms and shoot anyone who enters; thus the innocents will have no reason to leave their rooms, and the killer must stay put or admit his guilt.
Nora is chased from her room into the basement by Annabelle''s ghost. Aroused by the ghostly sounds, David concludes that the killer is about and proposes he and Frederick split up to search the house. Lance uncovers a secret room at the end of the second-floor hall, but once he enters the door shuts behind him, trapping him. David instead meets with Annabelle, who had faked her death using a hanging harness and sedatives. Secretly lovers, the two of them have orchestrated the various mishaps in order to manipulate Nora into killing Frederick. Nora, seeing Frederick enter the basement with a gun in his hand, does indeed shoot him. After she flees, David slips in to dispose of Frederick''s body in the vat of acid.
Annabelle walks to the basement to confirm her husband is dead. A skeleton rises from the acid, accuses her in Frederick''s voice, and shoves her into the vat. Frederick emerges from the shadows, holding the puppeteer control unit that he used to manipulate the skeleton and revealing he had known their plot all along.
After Nora, Watson and Ruth release Lance from the secret room, Nora tells them that she shot Frederick. When they arrive in the cellar, Frederick explains that he loaded her gun with blanks, that his wife and David plotted to kill him, and that they both met their end in the vat of acid. He implies that he will claim self-defense and, although responsible for their deaths, will not be convicted. Watson remains convinced the house is haunted, with David and Annabelle now added to its ranks of ghosts, and that he will be the next victim.','["William Castle"]',NULL,'["Vincent Price","Carol Ohmart","Richard Long"]','["Horror","Mystery"]','6.9','["tt0185371","tt0058700","tt0045888","tt0057129","tt0053925","tt0055304","tt0052602","tt0053363","tt0066740","tt0058333","tt0051622","tt0057449"]','["Drama; Horror; Thriller"]','[{"url":"/house_on_haunted_hill.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/house_on_haunted_hill_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/house_on_haunted_hill_ipod_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','house_on_haunted_hill_ipod',782957,'Q263583','wp','["Robb White"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Loew predicts disaster for his people and brings his assistant to inform the elders of the community. The next day the Holy Roman Emperor signs a royal decree declaring that the Jews must leave the city before the new moon. The Emperor sends the knight Florian to deliver the decree. Loew meanwhile begins to devise a way of defending the Jews.
Upon arriving at the ghetto, the arrogant Florian falls in love with Miriam, Loew''s daughter, for whom his assistant shares affection. Loew talks Florian into reminding the Emperor that it is he who predicts disasters and tells the horoscopes of the Emperor, and requests an audience with him. Having courted with Miriam, Florian leaves. By praying with God first, Loew begins to create the Golem,  a huge monster which he will bring to life out of clay to defend his people. Florian returns later with a request from the Emperor for Loew to attend the Rose Festival at the palace. He shares a romantic moment with Miriam while Loew reveals to his assistant that he has secretly created the Golem, and requires his assistance to animate it. In an elaborate magical procedure, Loew and the assistant summon the spirit Astaroth and compel him, as per the ancient texts, to say the magic word to bring life. This word is written on paper by Loew which is then enclosed in an amulet and inserted onto the Golem''s chest. The Golem awakes. Loew''s assistant then tames the Golem, and the Rabbi uses it as a household servant.
When Loew is summoned to the palace for the festival, he brings the Golem with him to impress the audience. Florian meanwhile slips away from the court to meet Miriam, whose house is being guarded by Loew''s assistant under Loew''s instruction. Back at the palace the court is both terrified and intrigued by the arrival of the Golem. Impressed, the Emperor asks to see more supernatural feats by Loew. Loew projects a magical screen showing the history of the Jews, instructing his audience not to make a noise. Upon the arrival of Ahasuerus, the Wandering Jew, the court begins to laugh and the palace suddenly crumbles. As the building collapses around them, the Golem intervenes and props up the falling ceiling, saving the court. As a sign of gratitude the Emperor pardons the Jews and allows them to stay in the city.
Loew and the Golem return to the ghetto, spreading the news that the Jews are saved. Loew returns to his house and begins to notice erratic behaviour in the Golem. He reads that upcoming astrological movements will cause Astaroth to possess the Golem and attack its creators. Loew removes the amulet and is called down by his assistant to join in the celebrations in the street. As the community rejoices, the assistant goes to inform Miriam and bring her to the synagogue but finds her in bed with Florian. Devastated, he reanimates the Golem and orders it to remove Florian from the building. But the Golem, now under Astaroth''s influence, literally does so by throwing Florian from the roof of the house, killing him. Horrified, the assistant and Miriam flee, but the Golem sets fire to the building and Miriam falls unconscious.
Loew''s assistant rushes to the synagogue to alert the praying Jews of the disaster, but upon their arrival at Loew''s house they find that it is burning and both the Golem and Miriam are missing. Despaired, the community begs Loew to save them from the rampaging Golem. Loew performs a spell that removes Astaroth from the Golem. Promptly, the Golem, who is wandering the ghetto causing destruction, leaves Miriam, whom he has been dragging by the hair through the streets, lying on a stone surface and heads towards the ghetto gate. He breaks the gate open and sees a group of girls playing. They all flee except for one, whom he picks up, having developed a docile nature following the removal of Astaroth. Out of curiosity she removes the amulet from the Golem. It drops her and collapses. Loew meanwhile finds Miriam, who awakes shortly after. Happily reunited, they are awkwardly joined by Loew''s assistant, who informs him that the Jews are waiting for him by the gate. Loew having left, the assistant promises to Miriam that he will never tell anyone of her forbidden affair with Florian, and asks in return for forgiveness for his actions. The Jews meanwhile gather at the gate to find the dead Golem. Rejoicing and praying, they carry it back into the ghetto, the Star of David appearing on the screen as the film ends.',NULL,'["Henrik Galeen","Paul Wegener"]','["Paul Wegener","Albert Steinrück","Ernst Deutsch"]','["Fantasy","Horror"]','7.2','["tt0004026","tt0014586","tt0003419","tt0012494","tt0176776","tt0013579","tt0011130","tt0015202","tt0016847","tt0011833","tt0011221","tt0010323"]','["horror; fantasy; silent; feature films"]','[{"url":"/TheGolem_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/TheGolem_893_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','TheGolem_893',61016,'Q522754','wp',NULL,'["Carl Boese","Paul Wegener"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

He then spirits her body away to the basement laboratory of his isolated mansion and extracts glandular fluid from behind her ears to inject into his vain and aged wife in order to renew her youth and beauty.  This is only the latest in a series of brides who appear to die at the altar and whose corpses subsequently vanish en route to the hospital or mortuary, and the police are thoroughly stymied.
A young journalist, Patricia Hunter, investigates the case and discovers it involves an unusual orchid.  She is directed to Lorenz, a known expert on orchids, and visits his mansion where she meets with a chilly reception from his wife.  She is forced to spend the night when a storm washes out the bridge to town, and discovers horror in the cellar beneath the Lorenz mansion: a crazed old woman and her two sons, one a sadistic dwarf and the other a hulking half-wit, all of whom assist Lorenz in his activities; and a mausoleum in which he keeps the bodies of his bride-victims, not all of whom may be entirely dead yet.  
Also staying the night is a neighboring young doctor, who attends Countess Lorenz for other medical issues.  When Patricia confides in him what she is investigating and what she has witnessed in the house, he agrees to help her.  She leaves the next day for the city and, with her editor, develops a plan to trap Lorenz with a staged wedding and plenty of police protection, but he outfoxes them, chloroforming Hunter and carrying her to his laboratory to now use her bodily fluids upon his wife.  However, during his escape, his dwarf-accomplice is shot and captured by the police.

The female employees catch eligible bachelors, marry them and then gets the marriage annulled immediately, making quite a profit from the settlement.
Monroe''s plans to marry off one of his dancers, Doris Starr, who is still oblivious about the annulment racket going on. Monroe has his sights on Anthony Tremaine, Jr., and Monroe''s task is to get the two to meet so they fall into each other''s arms.
Monroe pulls it off and the two love birds are married without their families'' knowledge. Monroe sees that the story ends up in the papers and Tony''s father surprises the couple on their honeymoon, threatening to disinherit his son if he doesn''t end the marriage.
Julie Cavanaugh, Doris'' sister, and the rest of her family and the neighbors get involved in the matter and a brawl ensues. The police arrive and arrests everyone involved, including Steve Randall, the governor''s son.
The next morning the papers are filled with the fighting. Monroe is overjoyed and uses his lawyer friend, Ben Sherwood, to pretend being Doris'' father and negotiate a big settlement to keep a lid on the matter. Doris and Tony drift apart because of the trouble surrounding their marriage.
An investigation of the Tropical Inn starts, led by State Detective Tex Cassidy, pretending to be a friend of the governor. He visits the club and brings Steve. They are accompanied by Julie and Goldie Duvall. Doris is worried for her sister, and tells her to stay away from Monroe. Monroe has led Doris to believe that he will marry her and she believes this, even though she knows he is as crooked.
When Doris sees Monroe kissing another woman in the club, she quits her job and says she will give Tony back the money from the settlement. Monroe follows her to her apartment and kills her. He is suspected of the murder since he was the last person seen alone with Doris.
Julie starts looking into the circumstances surrounding her sister''s death, and finds out that "her father" threatened to take legal action against Tony if they didn''t settle. Since Julie''s father has been dead for years she knows something is fishy. She suspects Monroe murdered her sister.
After Monroe finds out that Doris had written down the serial numbers of all the notes from the Tremaine settlement, he breaks into her home to retrieve them, but does not find them.
Julie discovers that Monroe runs the annulment racket and pretends to be interested in participating. Monroe plans to marry her to the Steve. After the marriage, Julie refuses to go through with the annulment.
Steve and Monroe get into a fight, and after Steve knocks Monroe in the head, the club owner pulls a gun on Steve. At gunpoint, Monroe forces the couple to sign an annulment agreement.
Later in the evening, Steve returns to the club with a gun, and there is a shootout. It ends when the governor arrives, bringing the serial numbers Doris wrote down, matching them to the money in a briefcase Monroe is carrying in his hand.
When Monroe is caught and arrested, Steve and Julie continue their romance and Goldie reveals she has fallen in live with Tex, the detective.','["Elmer Clifton"]',NULL,'["Jack La Rue","Mary Healy","Kane Richmond"]','["Crime","Drama"]','4.8','[]','["PRC;P.R.C.;Producers Releasing Corporation"]','[{"url":"/Hard_Guy_1941.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Hard_Guy_1941_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/Hard_Guy_1941_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','Hard_Guy_1941',9967,'Q5655232','wp','["Oliver Drake"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Krupp builds a robot with a human brain in it, planning to use it to destroy the mummy, should he return to thwart his efforts. Krupp''s former colleague and original finder of the mummy, Dr. Eduardo Almada (Ramón Gay), and associates Flor and Pinacate, work to stop the mad scientist from completing his plans. Almada and Flor are married in this third film in the series, and Pinacate has given up his masked superhero career as the Angel.
Dr. Krupp gets inside the mummy''s tomb and once again steals the gold breastplate from its resting place on the mummy''s chest. When Popoca wakes up in a rage, Krupp orders his human robot to fight him. The two monsters engage in a fierce struggle to the death, but the robot''s ability to deliver burns and electrical shocks from his hands quickly begin to wear the mummy down. Just as it seems the robot is winning, Dr. Almada bursts into the tomb and knocks the remote control from Dr. Krupp''s hands, effectively shutting off the robot''s brain. In a wild rage, Popoca tears into the robot, literally tearing him into scrap metal.

The minor clues lead nowhere. Two police detectives, Sergeants Marty Brennan (Scott Brady) and Chuck Jones (James Cardwell), are assigned to catch the killer, Roy Morgan (Richard Basehart), a brilliant mystery man with no known criminal past, who is hiding in a Hollywood bungalow and listening to police calls on his custom radio in an attempt to avoid capture. His only relationship is with his little dog.
Roy consigns burgled electronic equipment to Paul Reeves (Whit Bissell), and on his fifth sale is nearly caught when he shows up to collect on his property. Reeves tells police that the suspect is a mystery man named Roy Martin. The case crosses the paths of Brennan and Jones, who stake out Reeves'' office to arrest and question Roy. He suspects a trap, however, and in a brief shootout shoots and paralyzes Jones. Jones wounds Roy, who performs surgery on himself to remove the bullet and avoid going to a hospital, where his gunshot wound would be reported to the police. With his knowledge of police procedures, Roy changes his modus operandi and becomes an armed robber. During one robbery he fires his semi-automatic pistol, and the police recover the ejected casing. Lee (Jack Webb), a forensics specialist, matches the ejector marks on the casing to those recovered in the killing of Officer Rawlins and the wounding of Sgt. Jones, connecting all three shootings to one suspect.
Captain Breen (Roy Roberts) uses this break to gather all of the witnesses to the robberies. They assist Lee in building a composite photo of the killer. Reeves then identifies Roy from the composite. However, Roy hides in Reeves'' car and attempts to intimidate him into revealing details of the police investigation.  He barely eludes a stakeout of Reeves'' house. Because the police do not realize that Roy has inside knowledge of their work, the case goes nowhere. Breen takes Brennan off the case in an attempt to shake him up. Jones convinces his partner to stop viewing the case personally and to use his head. Plodding, methodical follow-up by Brennan, using the composite photograph, results in information that Roy, whose actual name is Roy Morgan, worked for a local police department as a civilian radio technician before being drafted into the Army. Brennan tracks him down through post office mail carriers and disguises himself as a milkman to get a close look at Morgan and his apartment.
The police surround and raid the apartment that night, but Morgan, alerted by his dog''s barking, flees through the attic and uses the Los Angeles storm drainage tunnel system as a means of escape. The film continues with a dragnet and chase through the drainage tunnels. Roy is finally cornered by the police in a passage when his exit is blocked by the wheel of a police car atop a manhole cover. As police tear gas affects Roy, he staggers and fires one last time at them. He is then shot down and killed.
The final scene is notable for its resemblance to the final scene in The Third Man in which Orson Welles'' character is chased through the sewers of Vienna.

('tt0036377','free','The Song of Bernadette (1943)','1943','2h 36min','François Soubirous (Roman Bohnen), a former miller now unemployed, is forced to take odd jobs and live in a hovel that was once the city jail with his wife (Anne Revere), his two sons, and his two daughters.  One morning, he goes to find work and is told to take contaminated trash from the hospital and burn it at Massabielle, then the city dump.
At the local Catholic school (run by the Sisters of Charity of Nevers) that she and her sister attend, fourteen-year-old Bernadette Soubirous (played by Jennifer Jones, who had herself been raised Catholic) is shamed in front of the class by Sister Vauzous, the teacher (Gladys Cooper), for not being able to explain what the Holy Trinity is.  Her sister Marie (Ermadean Walters) explains that Bernadette was out sick with asthma the day that the students learned about the Holy Trinity.  Abbé Dominique Peyramale (Charles Bickford) enters and awards the students holy cards, but is told by Sister Vauzous that Bernadette does not deserve one because she has not learned her catechism, and that it would not be fair to the other students.  Peyramale encourages Bernadette to study harder.
Later that afternoon, on an errand with her sister Marie and school friend Jeanne (Mary Anderson) to collect firewood outside the town of Lourdes, Bernadette is left behind when her companions warn her not to wade through the cold river by the Massabielle caves for fear of taking ill.  About to cross anyway, Bernadette is distracted by a strange breeze and a change in the light.  Investigating the cave, she finds a beautiful lady (Linda Darnell) standing in brilliant light, holding a pearl rosary.  She tells her sister and friend, who promise not to tell anyone else.  However, Marie tells their mother almost as soon as they reach home, and the story soon spreads all over town.
Many, including Bernadette''s Aunt Bernarde (Blanche Yurka), are convinced of her sincerity and stand up for her against her disbelieving parents, but Bernadette faces civil and church authorities alone.  Repeatedly questioned, she stands solidly behind her seemingly unbelievable story and continues to return to the cave as the lady has asked.  She faces ridicule as the lady tells her to drink and wash at a spring that doesn''t yet exist. In order to do what they lady asks, Bernadette digs a hole in the ground and uses the wet sand and mud.  Water begins to flow later and exhibits miraculous healing properties.  The lady finally identifies herself as "the Immaculate Conception".  Civil authorities try to have Bernadette declared insane, while Abbé Peyramale, the fatherly cleric who once doubted her and now becomes her staunchest ally, asks for a formal investigation to find out if Bernadette is a fraud, insane, or genuine.
The grotto is closed and the Bishop of Tarbes (Charles Waldron) declares that unless the Emperor (Jerome Cowan) orders the grotto to be opened, there will be no investigation by the church.  He says this will be a test for Bernadette''s "lady".  Shortly thereafter, the Emperor''s infant son falls ill and, under instructions from the Empress (Patricia Morison), the child''s nanny obtains a bottle of the water.  Arrested for violating the closure order, she appears in court, identifies herself as the Empress'' employee, and pays the fines of the other persons who attempted to enter the grotto, so that they need serve no time in jail.  The magistrate permits her to go and to take the bottle of water with her.  The Emperor''s son drinks the water and recovers.  The Empress believes that his recovery is miraculous, but the Emperor, though he believes in God, is not sure.  The Empress upbraids him for ingratitude, and at her insistence, the Emperor gives the order to reopen the grotto.  The Bishop of Tarbes then directs the commission to convene.  The investigation takes many years, and Bernadette is questioned again and again, but the commission eventually determines that Bernadette experienced visions and was visited by the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God.
Bernadette prefers to go on with an ordinary life, work, and possible marriage, but Peyramale does not think it is appropriate to turn Bernadette loose in the world and persuades her to become a nun at the motherhouse of the Sisters of Charity in Nevers, the Saint Gildard Convent.  She is subjected to normal although rigorous spiritual training and hard work at the convent, but also emotional abuse from a cold and sinister Sister Vauzous, her former school teacher, who is now mistress of novices at the convent.  Sister Vauzous is skeptically jealous of all the attention Bernadette has been receiving as a result of the visions.  She reveals this to Bernadette, saying she is angry that God would choose Bernadette instead of her when she has spent her life in suffering in service of God.  She says Bernadette has not suffered enough and wants a "sign" proving Bernadette really was chosen by Heaven.
Bernadette makes a revelation to Sister Vauzous which is later diagnosed as tuberculosis of the bone.  The condition causes intense pain, yet Bernadette has never complained or so much as mentioned it.  The jealous sister, realizing her error and Bernadette''s saintliness, begs for forgiveness in the chapel, and vows to serve Bernadette for the rest of her life.  Knowing she is dying, Bernadette sends for Abbé Peyramale and tells him of her feelings of unworthiness and her concern that she will never see the lady again.  But the lady appears in the room, smiling and holding out her arms.  Only Bernadette can see her, however, and with a cry of "I love you! I love you! Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for me", she reaches out to the apparition, and falls back dead.  Peyramale utters the final words of the film, "You are now in Heaven and on earth.  Your life begins, O Bernadette".','["Henry King"]','["George Seaton","Franz Werfel"]','["Jennifer Jones","Charles Bickford","William Eythe"]','["Biography","Drama"]','7.6','["tt0037536","tt0037280","tt0044905","tt0037465","tt0036872","tt0035896","tt0040495","tt0036983","tt0036515","tt0036126","tt0040705","tt0036172"]','["Biography;Drama"]','[{"url":"/SongOfBernadette.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/TheSongOfBernadette1943_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','TheSongOfBernadette1943',31958,'Q669749','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

He was Rachel''s firstborn and Israel''s eleventh son. Of all the sons, Joseph was loved by his father the most. Israel even arrayed Joseph with a "long coat of many colors". Israel''s favoritism toward Joseph caused his half brothers to hate him, and when Joseph was seventeen years old he had two dreams that made his brothers plot his demise. In the first dream, Joseph and his brothers gathered bundles of grain. Then, all of the grain bundles that had been prepared by the brothers gathered around Joseph''s bundle and bowed down to it. In the second dream, the sun (father), the moon (mother) and eleven stars (brothers) bowed down to Joseph himself. When he told these two dreams to his brothers, they despised him for the implications that the family would be bowing down to Joseph. They became jealous that their father would even ponder over Joseph''s words concerning these dreams. (Genesis 37:1-11)
They saw their chance when they were feeding the flocks, the brothers saw Joseph from afar and plotted to kill him. They turned on him and stripped him of the coat his father made for him, and threw him into a pit. As they pondered what to do with Joseph, the brothers saw a camel caravan of Ishmaelites coming out of Gilead, carrying spices and perfumes to Egypt, for trade.

('tt4044364','free','Citizenfour (2014)','2014','1h 54min','In January 2013, Laura Poitras, an American documentary film director/producer who had been working for several years on a film about monitoring programs in the United States that were the result of the September 11 attacks, receives an encrypted e-mail from a stranger who calls himself, "Citizenfour." In it, he offers her inside information about illegal wiretapping practices of the US National Security Agency (NSA) and other intelligence agencies. In June 2013, accompanied by investigative journalist Glenn Greenwald and The Guardian intelligence reporter Ewen MacAskill, she travels to Hong Kong with her camera for the first meeting with the stranger in a hotel, who reveals himself as Edward Snowden. Scenes of their meeting take place in Snowden''s hotel room, where he maintains his privacy. Shots of Snowden in his bed, in front of his mirror and of the hotel from a distance form the character of Snowden as a trapped political agent.After four days of interviews, on June 9, Snowden''s identity is made public at his request. As media outlets begin to discover his location at The Mira Hong Kong, Snowden relocates to Poitras'' room in an attempt to elude phone calls made to his room. Facing potential extradition and prosecution in the United States, Snowden schedules a meeting with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and applies for refugee status. After Poitras believes she is being followed, she leaves Hong Kong for Berlin.
On June 21, the US government requests the Hong Kong government extradite Snowden. Snowden manages to depart from Hong Kong, but his US passport is cancelled before he can connect to Havana, stranding him in the Sheremetyevo International Airport in Moscow. On August 1, 2013, the Russian government grants Snowden temporary asylum for a period of one year. Meanwhile, Greenwald returns to his home in Rio de Janeiro and speaks publicly about United States'' utilization of NSA programs for foreign surveillance. Greenwald and Poitras maintain a correspondence wherein they both express reluctance to return to the United States.
Throughout, the film offers smaller vignettes that precede and follow Snowden''s Hong Kong interviews, including William Binney speaking about NSA programs, and eventually testifying before the German Parliament regarding NSA spying in Germany.
The film closes with Greenwald, Snowden and Poitras meeting once again, this time in Russia. Greenwald and Snowden discuss new emerging details on US intelligence programs, careful to only write down and not speak critical pieces of information. Greenwald tears these documents creating a pile of scraps, before slowly removing them from the table.','["Laura Poitras"]',NULL,'["Edward Snowden","Glenn Greenwald","William Binney"]','["Documentary","Biography","News","Thriller"]','8.1','["tt3774114","tt3268458","tt1645089","tt4257858","tt2375605","tt4964772","tt1587707","tt1313104","tt2545118","tt2125608","tt0310793","tt4477936"]','["Citizen Four","Documentary","Edward Snowden"]','[{"url":"/Citizen.Four2014_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/citizen.four(2014).mp4","format":"MPEG4"}]','Citizen.Four2014',4283,'Q18218448','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
('tt0024747','free','Waltzes from Vienna (1934)','1934','1h 21min','Waltzes from Vienna begins with the sound of a fire brigade horn and the clip-clop of horses’ hooves, as the firemen race towards a fire at Ebezeder''s Café. Upstairs from the café, Resi and Schani are oblivious to the danger, lost in a love duet that concludes with Schani telling Resi that he has dedicated his newest song to her. At the same time, Schani''s music attracts the attention of the Countess Helga von Stahl, who is shopping in the dressmaker''s store next door. Schani and Resi''s romantic interlude is interrupted by Leopold, a baker in Resi''s father''s café who is in love with Resi, as he awkwardly climbs up the ladder to save her. Schani and Leopold argue over who will save Resi from the fire, but Leopold eventually wins and hauls Resi over his shoulder and down the ladder, causing her to lose her skirt on the way. Resi races to the dressmaker''s shop to get away from the laughter of the onlookers. Schani retrieves Resi''s skirt and then stumbles into the dressmaker''s in search of Resi, where he meets the Countess. When the Countess learns that Schani is an aspiring musician, she proposes that he set some of her verses to music. As the Countess offers Schani her card, Resi enters the room and becomes immediately suspicious of the Countess''s intentions.
With the romantic triangle set up, the next scene sets up the conflict between Schani and his father. At orchestra rehearsal, in which Schani plays second violin under his father''s baton, Schani gets himself in trouble when he insults his father''s music to his stand partner. The elder Strauss overhears and demands that Schani perform one of his own compositions for the members of the orchestra. Strauss Sr. then ridicules his son''s waltz and tells him he could never have a career as a composer, inciting Schani to quit the orchestra.
Excited by his newfound freedom and the commission from the Countess, Schani visits Resi at her father''s bakery to tell her his news. Resi initially berates Schani and informs him that, if he wants to marry her, he will have to give up music and take over the bakery. However, when she reads the Countess''s lyrics, she is drawn into the music, singing the opening of The Blue Danube waltz to Schani. Their moment of composition is interrupted when Resi''s father arrives to give Schani a tour of the bakery. As Schani and Ebezeder walk into the basement, a memorable and unusual scene of musical composition begins. While Schani looks around, the tune that Resi sang begins to evolve. Two men throwing bread back and forth inspire the second phrase of the melody; a man tossing croissants into a box creates the offbeat rhythm of the waltz. The rhythm of the dough mixing machine provides Schani with the second main theme of the first waltz. As he tells the begrudging Leopold to go faster, this second theme turns into the beginning of the second large section of piece, at which point Schani runs upstairs, exclaiming to Resi that he has finished the composition. He then rushes off to tell the Countess that he has composed the perfect waltz to accompany her verses.
The next scene opens with Schani playing the final measures of the waltz to the Countess. After he finishes, she kisses him and then apologizes profusely, explaining that she was overwhelmed by his wonderful music. Schani then plays the second section of the waltz while her hand rests possessively on his shoulder, which, through a dissolve, becomes Resi''s hand. After thanking Resi for coming up with the phrase, Schani agrees to dedicate the song to her. As the scene fades away, the page with Schani''s dedication to Resi flips up to reveal another page with the same title, but dedicated to the Countess.
The duplicitous dedication is discovered when Resi hears Schani and the Countess playing the waltz for the publisher, Anton Drexler. Schani runs after Resi to explain and they reconcile only when Schani tells her that he will give up his music to work in the bakery. However, Schani is clearly miserable in his new job and he fights with Resi when he receives an invitation from the Countess to attend St. Stephen''s Festival. Resi tells Schani that, if he attends, it will mean the end of their relationship. Meanwhile, the Countess plots a ruse that will cause Strauss Sr. to be late for the festival so that Schani can take his father''s place to conduct his new waltz.
As Schani conducts The Blue Danube at the festival, all of the film''s conflicts come to a climax. The Countess detains the elder Strauss by asking the dancers at the festival to play to his ego, requesting that he play his waltzes over and over for their pleasure in a back room. Strauss Sr. finally arrives to find that his son has taken his place, performing for an enthusiastic audience. Meanwhile, Resi laments that Schani betrayed her by coming to the festival at the Countess''s command.
Following the performance, the elder Strauss angrily tells his son that he had not authorized the performance, as the Countess had led him to believe. Schani leaves the festival in confusion and the Countess follows him home where they share another kiss. However, the romantic moment is interrupted by the Count, who, upon learning where the Countess had gone, left the party in a rage. Resi arrives in time to sneak in the back and replace the Countess, who then walks back up the front stairs to surprise her husband, as the crowd outside hums The Blue Danube Waltz.','["Alfred Hitchcock"]','["Heinz Reichert","Ernst Marischka"]','["Edmund Gwenn","Esmond Knight","Jessie Matthews"]','[""]','6.0','["tt0022395","tt0023285","tt0023395","tt0020142","tt0028231","tt0021165","tt0018876","tt0017843","tt0017825","tt0029811","tt0018756","tt0021128"]','["Romance; Strauss; Music; Biography; Hitchcock"]','[{"url":"/Waltzes_from_Vienna.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/Waltzes_from_Vienna_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/Waltzes_from_Vienna_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','Waltzes_from_Vienna',40223,'Q570302','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

When he is drafted in the Army, he memorizes all the manuals for Army procedure immediately before starting his service.
Because of his extensive knowledge of procedure, he is quickly known as a know-it-all at the basic training in Camp Carver. His drill sergeant, Sergeant Ames, disapproves of him from the start, but the officers above him are quite impressed with the new recruit due to his memorisation and word perfect recital of Army Regulations.
On his first day in the Army Dodo is sent to non commissioned officer school but after a brief time he returns to inform the officers that as he proficiently demonstrated his knowledge of military regulations he was ordered to sew on First Sergeant chevrons and return to his unit.  This infuriates the now outranked Ames as it has taken him twenty years to make buck sergeant. Sgt Ames sees his chance for revenge when he insists Dodo is put in charge of the worst and most chaotic company on the camp: Company F. The soldiers try to make things hard for Dodo, by following his orders to the letter.  When Dodo orders his company to report for training in overcoats, rifles and full packs, the men fall out only wearing these items with no other clothing. As soon as Sergeant Ames hears this he reports it to Major Greer, hoping it will shorten Dodo''s career as a non commissioned officer.
When the officer threatens the men with 30 days imprisonment, Dodo explains that he is just trying out some new ideas, training with a minimal amount of equipment. He claims his men are of a tough Kentucky breed and can walk without shoes. Unfortunately Greer buys this and has the company march around barefoot all day, but they are neither imprisoned nor fined.
Dodo''s reputation as a drill-sergeant spreads, and he is swarmed by impressed camp hostesses at a dance that night. When Company F is ordered to perform guard duty, his soldiers relieve each other by riding on different kinds of vehicles, including a mule based on their interpretation of an army regulation for posting guards.
When the mule ruins the marching band parade, Captain Rossmead is upset and punishes the men with extra guard duty. Dodo accepts the punishment on behalf of his men, but the Captain decides to not carry out the punishment when his Major informs him that as the Captain as his duties of Officer of the Day didn''t specify which specific method of transportation to use when posting the guards of his command; upsetting Ames in the process.
Dodo becomes very popular among his men because of taking the blame. They promise to do their best and be loyal to Dodo from now on. But Ames doesn''t give up. He gets Rossmead to assign Dodo to be an orderly under infamous Colonel Barkley, known as "Spitfire".
Ames plan backfires, as Dodo accidentally makes a radio pep speech the Colonel was supposed to make, and it is a huge success. The Colonel has stage-fright and is afraid of microphones, and accepts Dodo''s posing as him for a moment while making the speech.
While Dodo tries on the Colonel''s uniform, his girlfriend arrives to camp and believes he has been promoted to colonel. Dodo lets her believe this while he makes the speech. When he is done, Ames and Rossmead arrest him for his insubordinance, but since the success of the speech has reached all the way to Washington, Dodo is not punished, but returned to duty with Sgt Ames becoming the Colonel''s regular orderly.','["Fred Guiol"]','["Paul Gerard Smith","Warren Wilson"]','["William Tracy","James Gleason","Noah Beery Jr."]','["Adventure","Comedy","Romance"]','6.2','["tt0029923","tt0021770","tt0036009","tt0037136","tt0037893","tt0033696","tt0040432","tt0046138","tt0018528"]','["Comedy"]','[{"url":"/TanksaMillion.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/TanksaMillion_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/TanksaMillion_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','TanksaMillion',10671,'Q7683567','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

In his prison cell, the priest prepares to burn a parchment containing the location of the secret formula. Gen. Mazovia (Roy D''Arcy) kills the priest and takes the partially burned parchment. After the war, an expedition of representatives from the Allied countries with colonial interests are sent to Cambodia to find and destroy forever the so-called "Secret of the Zombies". The group includes General Mazovia; a student of dead languages, Armand Louque (Dean Jagger); Englishman Clifford Grayson (Robert Noland); General Duval (George Cleveland); and his daughter Claire (Dorothy Stone).
Armand falls in love with Claire, who accepts his proposal of marriage to spite Clifford, whom she really loves. Later, when Claire runs to Cliff for comfort following an accident, Armand breaks the engagement, leaving her free to marry Cliff. Further accidents caused by Mazovia result in the natives refusing to work, forcing the expedition to return to Phnom Penh. Armand finds a clue which he had overlooked before and returns to Angkor against orders.
After viewing an ancient ceremony at a temple, Armand follows one of the servants of a high priest out of the temple, through a swamp, to a mysterious bronze doorway. When the servant leaves, Armand goes through the door to a room paneled in bronze, with an idol holding a gong. He accidentally strikes the gong, and a panel in the wall opens, revealing a small metal tablet. He translates the inscription and realizes that it is the secret for which they have all been looking. He alone now has the power to make zombies out of people, and begins with a practice run on his servant before using his zombie powers in an attempt to coerce the fickle Claire in the movie''s climax.','["Victor Halperin"]',NULL,'["Dorothy Stone","Dean Jagger","Roy D''Arcy"]','["Adventure","Horror"]','3.3','["tt0033787","tt0023236","tt0025452","tt0032215","tt0023694","tt0037084","tt0031387","tt0032457","tt0035784","tt0024727","tt0035009","tt0034521"]','["Horror; Romance; War"]','[{"url":"/RevoltoftheZombies.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/RevoltoftheZombies_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/RevoltoftheZombies__archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','RevoltoftheZombies_',34936,'Q731769','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

('tt0045826','free','Glen or Glenda (1953)','1953','1h 5min','The film begins with a narrator, called The Scientist (Bela Lugosi), making cryptic comments about humanity. He first comments that humanity''s constant search for the unknown results in startling things coming to light. But most of these "new" discoveries are actually quite old, which he refers to as "the signs of the ages". Later, the scene turns to the streets of a city, with the narrator commenting that each human has his/her own thoughts, ideas, and personality. He makes further comments on human life, while sounds accompany some comments. The cries of a newborn baby are followed by the sirens of an ambulance. One is a sign that a new life has begun, the other that a life has ended.This last comment starts the narrative of the film. The life which has ended is that of a transvestite named Patrick/Patricia, who has committed suicide. A scene opens with their corpse in a small room. Within the room is an unidentified man who opens the door to a physician, a photographer, and the police. A suicide note explains the reasons behind the suicide. Patrick/Patricia had been arrested four times for cross-dressing in public, and had spent time in prison. Since they would continue wearing women''s clothing, subsequent arrests and imprisonment were only a matter of time. So they ended their own life and wished to be buried with their women''s clothing. "Let my body rest in death forever, in the things I cannot wear in life."Inspector Warren is puzzled and wants to know more about cross-dressing. So he seeks the office of Dr. Alton, who narrates for him the story of Glen/Glenda. Glen is shown studying women''s clothes in a shop window. Dr. Alton points out that men''s clothes are dull and restrictive, whereas women can adorn themselves with attractive and comfortable clothing. A flashback scene reveals that a young Glen started out by asking to wear his sister''s dress for a Halloween party. And he did, despite his father''s protests. But he then continued wearing his sister''s clothing, and Sheila (the sister) eventually caught him in the act.  She shuns him afterward.The narrative explains that Glen is a transvestite, but not a homosexual. He hides his cross-dressing from his fiancée, Barbara, fearing that she will reject him. She has no idea that certain of her clothes are fetish objects for him. When Barbara notices that something is bothering him, Glen does not have the courage to explain his secret to her. She voices her suspicion that there is another woman in his life, unaware that the woman is his feminine alter ego, Glenda. The scene shifts from a speechless Glen to footage of a stampeding herd of bison, while the Scientist calls for Glen to "Pull the string". The meaning of the call is unclear, though it could be a call for opening the proverbial curtain and revealing the truth.Alton narrates that Glen is torn between the idea of being honest with Barbara before their wedding, or waiting until after. The narrative shifts briefly from Glen''s story to how society reacts to sex change operations. A conversation between two "average joes", concludes that society should be more "lenient" when it comes to people with tranvestite tendencies. The story returns to Glen, who confides in a transvestite friend of his, John, whose wife left him after catching him wearing her clothes.Later, a scene opens with Glen/Glenda walking the city streets at night. They return home in obvious anguish, when the sound of thunder causes them to collapse to the floor. The Scientist cryptically comments "Beware! Beware! Beware of the big, green dragon that sits on your doorstep! He eats little boys, puppy dog tails, and big, fat snails! Take care! Beware!" This serves as the introduction to an extended dream sequence. The dream opens with Barbara anguished at seeing Glenda. Then Barbara is depicted trapped under a tree, while the room around is in a chaotic state. Glenda fails to lift the tree and rescue Barbara. Glenda is replaced by Glen, who completes the task with ease. The dream then depicts Glen and Barbara getting married. The priest seems normal but the best man is a stereotypical devil, smiling ominously, suggesting that this marriage is damned.  The dream shifts to the Scientist, who seems to speak to the unseen dragon, asking it what it eats. The voice of a little girl provides the answers in an apparently mocking tone.The dreams continues with a strange series of vignettes. A woman is whipped by a shirtless man in a BDSM-themed vignette. Several women "flirt and partially disrobe" for an unseen audience. A woman tears apart her dress in a dramatic manner, then starts a coy striptease. The whipped woman from an earlier vignette appears alone in an autoerotic session. Her pleasure is interrupted by another woman who forcibly binds and gags her. Another woman has a similar autoerotic session and then falls asleep. As she sleeps, a predatory male approaches and rapes her, with the victim seeming partially willing by the end of it. Throughout these vignettes, the faces of Glen and the Scientist appear. They seem to be silently reacting to the various images.The dream returns to Glen, who is haunted by sounds of mocking voices and howling winds. He is soon confronted by two spectral figures. A blackboard appears, with messages recording what the Scientist or the mocking voices said in previous scenes. A large number of spectres appear, all gazing at him with disapproval, as if serving as the jury of public opinion on his perceived deviance. The mocking voices return. The Devil and the various spectres menacingly approach Glen. Then the Devil departs, Glen turns into Glenda, and the spectres retreat. A victorious Glenda sees Barbara and approaches her, but she turns into a mocking Devil. Barbara starts appearing and disappearing, always evading Glenda''s embrace. Then she starts mocking her lover. The Devil and spectres also shift to mocking Glenda. The dream sequence ends.Glen/Glenda wakes and stares at their mirror reflection. They decide to tell Barbara the truth. She initially reacts with distress, but ultimately decides to stay with him.  She offers them an angora sweater as a sign of acceptance. The scene effectively concludes their story.Back in Dr. Alton''s office, he starts another narrative. This one concerns another tranvestite, called Alan/Anne. He was born a boy, but his mother wanted a girl and raised him as such. Their father did not care either way. They were an outsider as a child, trying to be one of the girls and consequently rejected by schoolmates of both sexes. As a teenager, they self-identified as a woman. They were conscripted in World War II, maintaining a secret life throughout their military service. They first heard of sex change operations during the War while recovering from combat wounds in a hospital.  They eventually did have a sex change operation, enduring the associated pains to fulfill their dreams. The World War II veteran becomes a "lovely young lady".

The island has not yet attracted the attention of the slave traders on the mainland, but its people are suffering fierce oppression under their hereditary queen Zinga - a tyrant, despot, and mistress of cruelty.
What first appears on screen is a grassland landscape in which men of an African tribe are patrolling, with haystacks and rugged hills in the background. Into this scene there comes a bare-chested young African, as strong as a bull, looking around him cautiously.
Next we see the brutal Queen Zinga, wearing a leopard-skin dress, a straw hat, and a shell necklace on which hangs a medallion, a symbol of kingship. Laughing vigorously, she is teasing a man tied on a wooden column, who is supposed to be the king of Casanga. Zinga takes off the necklace and puts it on the man''s neck, taunting him as a "one-second king" and trying to kill him straight away. Suddenly, a girl, apparently frustrated by the cruelty of the planned execution, rushes towards the queen, grabs the medallion, and runs off. Astonished, the queen orders her soldiers to catch the fleeing girl and to recover the medallion. However, with the help of the strong young man seen at the beginning of the film, she is able to escape from the soldiers and the two get onto a raft to row it to the mainland. Once there, they turn to a white slave-trader for help. The slaver happily accepts them into his camp and adds them to his chain. Then, along with all the other blacks the slaver has acquired, the couple is filled with anxiety and fear. Sent to England by boat to begin their new life, they are not sure what is in store for them.
Time runs on and historical events unfold, such as the abolition of the slave trade in the British Empire in 1807. But not until 1838 did the slaves themselves become  free from the oppressing situation and the social status for blacks start to improve. Chains and handcuffs are destroyed, ropes and whips are burned, and a seemingly brand new story begins, centring on John Zinga, a black dockworker in England with a great baritone singing voice. His singing impresses all his colleagues on the wharf. Children in his apartment block fall asleep soundly when he sings, but he himself doesn’t realize what use he can make use of his voice. In fact, what keeps hovering in his mind is the eagerness to discover his true origins and to help his own people, although he doesn’t know who they are. Zinga always considers himself out of place in London and is often blamed by his wife for being ‘not satisfied’, but never does he change his mind. Finally, one day an opera impresario hears him singing and tries his best to find out about him. And in a pub, while Zinga is being invited by the owner to sing the song "Lonely Road", Gabriel Donizetti, the famous impresario, comes quietly in from the door and sits in the audience, watching, listening, and enjoying the beautiful song. "No more docker, but a great career" Donizetti promises Zinga, who is shocked and surprised since he thinks he can achieve his dream of travelling back to Africa by this chance. They shake hands with each other and Donizetti leaves a card for Zinga to come to his hotel room the next day.
Zinga can’t wait to go. The next day he dresses in a suit, apparently for the first time since he both walks and acts in a lame and inappropriate way. Zinga''s wife is also with him to deal with the hotel managers. In the end they find the way to Donizetti''s room and he starts a series of tests and introduces several skills to help Zinga improve his singing. At first Zinga is reluctant to accept these instructions, like ‘breathing from the stomach’ and ‘singing from the breast’, claiming that he knows how to sing. And he fights against singing in a suit, since he doesn’t feel ‘free’. His voice significantly lacks emotion compared to when he sings freely with friends and in a pub about his homeland in Africa. But after his wife''s comforting, mainly focussing on the chance of travelling back to Africa, he is persuaded to follow those doctrinaire rules and techniques.
After long training and practice, Zinga becomes an international opera star and succeeds in all kind of concerts and dramas. This brings him wealth and fame that he has never dreamt of. Yet he feels alienated from his African past, always being sarcastic towards his slave-born identity as his being referred as the Negro King. One day after a great performance, Zinga is instructed to give a speech about what he feels about his success. Not good at public speaking, he sings an old song derived from his long lost childhood memory that he barely remembers and into which has to put some words. In the song, he himself is regarded as a ‘wanderer’ and ‘hears the cold felt by his people’. John has a feeling that by singing the song he may find out some information about his origins, which means much to him. The result does not fail him. The song is moving and invokes one of the audience''s memories about the song. He comes to the dressing room at the back of the stage and talk to John about what he knows. John then finds out that his ancestor belongs to the island of Casanga, located on the west coast of Africa. The man from the audience, Pele, was the only white man to escape from the island since it was dominated by a brutal queen, and it is now ruled by a wicked witch doctor. And the song John sang was the secret song passed on by every king, regarded as the "Song of Freedom" of the Casanga people. Pele also tells Zinga the medallion hanging on his neck, which he got from his father and his father had from his great-grandfather, is the symbol of the kingship-----he, John Zinga, is the king of his people. Hearing that his people are still uncivilized on the island, Zinga''s idea of going back to his homeland to help his people became even more fixed. At this time Donizetti happens to come in and tells John some good news - a new contract to work in the great New York City. Zinga refuses to go to New York to carry on his singing career, since he considers his people bigger than his success. Donizetti is mad about Zinga leaving his career, but cannot stop him from crossing the ocean to come to the little island in Africa.
When Zinga arrives on the island he, his wife and a servant are not trusted by the aboriginals. Even though they have the same skin color and Zinga has the medallion which proves him the king, he and his fellows are still considered out-siders, strangers or even bad guys coming from the whites’ country. That''s far from Zinga''s expectation, which lets him down for a time. His servant wants to resign and tell him to give up, even he himself thinks the place is too primitive and his people are too hard to change. But his wife stands by his side and encourages him ‘the worse things are, the more you can change’. Soon he cheers up and waits for his chance in a shabby dome. And it comes. Zinga finds out that the witch doctor locks patients up instead of treating them for the lack of medicine. The witch doctor also announces that when a person gets sick - no matter a fever or cancer - he''s dead rather than ill. To deal with this inhuman act, Zinga gives the patient Penicillin and tries to heal them. Some of the people start to believe in Zinga. They tell him "I’m your man, but you can be no king." But this doesn’t last long when the witch doctor began to form various rituals to cast the ‘disaster’ the outsiders brought to the island. What''s worse is that the people''s trust in Zinga diminishes since the patients he tried to cure all die. To break the superstition Zinga interrupts the rites, attempting to show that no taboos are going to act on him, but is scolded by the crowds. Therefore, the witch doctor come up with a task of bringing the rain. He claims that by rituals he can always bring rains to the island, then the gods and ghosts will be satisfied and cast no disaster and diseases to the men and women; yet Zinga points out frankly that the cause of disease is the bacteria and germs in the river and he cannot bring rains but he can help saving the rain. And he begins to illustrate the amazing life brought by technology improvement from the other side of the ocean. With the help of his followers, more and more and people of the clan believe in him.
The witch doctor is so angry that he jumps up and down to try to scare people from getting in touch with Zinga. While they are debating, Zinga''s wife runs out and shouts to the witch doctor to support her husband. But that violats the taboo of not letting women join the ritual and the witch doctor feels perfectly justified to put Zinga''s wife in the basement. Zinga, who tried to protect his wife, is also tied up by the army. They are going to execute both of them the next day. And by the moonlight, Zinga''s wife sang miserably to him to show her dismay. Zinga''s followers bring him his gun but he refuses it. He determines not to use force to hurt his people but to convince them in other way.
Next day the ritual is being held. The witch doctor performs different kinds of tricks, such as fire swallowing to intimidate his people, so that Zinga''s followers are afraid to rescue them. Both Zinga and his wife are tied to a wooden pole, waiting to be killed, just as hundreds of years ago, the evil in charge of the island won against the justice. Then the drums for the execution start, and the rhythm starts to sound increasingly familiar to Zinga. It''s the Song of Freedom, the secret song passed on by each king of the island. He can’t help but start singing the Song and sings so well that the crowds turn astonishment to appreciation and admiration. He''s the king!! Someone from the crowd shouts out and the people eventually believe he is the king and are willing to listen to him. Zinga wins against the witch doctor at last and achieves his dream. He goes back to America and frequently brings back medicine and technology of all kinds, helping his people to become civilized and educated.
At the end of the movie, Zinga picks up his career as a singer again and performs the song he sang a long time ago, "Lonely Road" on a stage decorated as his little island, referring to his achieving his dream and the help he brought to his people, leading them to a better life.','["J.

Hammond, owner of the town''s stagecoach line and a leading citizen on the council, is secretly opposed to Idaho becoming a state—because government protection would destroy the system and organization he has constructed—and conducts raids against citizens and settlers alike to prevent order, while keeping his own identity as the organization''s leader secret. The town marshal is meanwhile powerless to act outside his jurisdiction beyond the town boundary. Randolph Meredith, owner of the town''s newspaper, as the Black Whip, opposes this scheme to defeat statehood, but one day he is killed after preventing yet another coup. Meredith''s sister Barbara, expert with a bullwhip and pistol, dons Randolph''s black costume and mask and becomes "The Black Whip" in her brother''s place, dealing a blow to Hammond and his gang each time they perform some heinous act in their efforts to keep the town, and their power over it, unchanged.
Aided by recently arrived undercover US government agent Vic Gordon, Barbara (Linda Stirling) as The Black Whip is quite obviously female but, even after a bout of wrestling, the villains do not realise they aren''t fighting a man.  Some reference is made to this in the script, however, when the villains are trying to determine who the Black Whip''s secret identity could be:

Hammond: Barbara Meredith, she''s the Black Whip!
Baxter: She couldn''t be! The Black Whip''s got to be a man! He''s outshot us, outrode us, and outfought us, stopped us at every turn!

Hammond orders her taken, but the day is saved when Vic Gordon discovers Barbara''s secret and removes her from suspicion by appearing in her costume and overcoming her captors.  From this point on, despite relinquishing the costume at her insistence that she must continue as the Black Whip, he tends to assume the hero role while Barbara becomes slightly more of a traditional damsel in distress, even while she still holds her own in successive violent confrontations with Hammond''s henchmen, and more than once saves Vic''s life.
After the town has finally voted on whether or not to accept statehood, most of Hammond''s gang are gunned down while attempting to steal the ballot boxes. Hammond escapes, and secretly trails and confronts Barbara in her cave when she removes her mask. He takes aim, but is struck down by the Black Whip''s stallion. The reign of terror has ended. Vic remains with Barbara and the marshall to help maintain peace in the territory.',NULL,'["Basil Dickey","Jesse Duffy"]','["George J.

Buzz Johnson (Bud Abbott) overhears Diana saying that she will pay $2,500 for a map that is inside that book.  He devises a plan to pass off his friend Stanley Livington (Lou Costello) as a great explorer who accompanied Cuddleford on the expedition described in the book.  With claims that he can reproduce the map, the two men go to Diana''s home that very night. They agree to accompany her on an African expedition, and when Buzz overhears that Clyde Beatty has been offered $20,000 to lead the expedition, he feels that the map is worth considerably more than $2,500.
They travel to Africa, along with Diana''s team of explorers, including Harry (Joe Besser), ''Boots'' Wilson (Buddy Baer), ''Grappler'' McCoy (Max Baer) and Gunner (Shemp Howard), a nearsighted professional hunter. The boys learn that the true expedition is for diamonds rather than exploration, and Buzz plans to renegotiate the deal. Stanley cannot reproduce the map, as he has never seen it, and the two attempt to bluff their way around the jungle.
Eventually Buzz and Stanley find a trail of diamonds, which lead straight to a cannibal village, where the residents intend to roast the two. They are rescued by a gorilla who has taken a liking to Stanley after he rescues it from a trapper''s pit.
The next day the cannibal tribe meets with the rest of the expeditionary team, where the chief offers several diamonds in exchange for Stanley ("Chief have sweet tooth," explains his translator.). They start to chase Stanley all over the place while Buzz buries the diamonds. The expeditionary team, along with the tribal warriors, are finally frightened away by a giant gorilla (Charles Gemora), whose existence had been dismissed as a myth earlier in the film. Stanley rushes to find Buzz, only to discover that Buzz, having lost the diamonds, has had enough and is abandoning his friend. Meanwhile, the friendly gorilla from before digs up the diamonds that Buzz has hidden and gives them to Stanley offscreen.
Some time after returning to the United States, Stanley owns the department store, along with the gorilla, and Buzz works for them as the elevator operator.','["Charles Barton"]',NULL,'["Bud Abbott","Lou Costello","Clyde Beatty"]','["Action","Adventure","Comedy"]','6.2','["tt0042179","tt0045469","tt0033754","tt0043255","tt0047795","tt0047794","tt0041085","tt0045468","tt0033436","tt0044851","tt0032873","tt0038694"]','["comedy;Abbott;Costello;Abbott and Costello"]','[{"url":"/AfricaScreams_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/Africa_Screams.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Africa_Screams_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','AfricaScreams',253147,'Q23892','wp','["Earl Baldwin"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

It revolves around the former Red Army sergeant Lazarev who was captured in his German uniform by Soviet partisans. Earlier he was captured by the Nazis and become a collaborator (hiwi), but after being captured by partisans he starts fighting against the Nazis. 
The title of the film was based on real events: partisans used to stop a truck full of "politsais" (police made of local collaborators) or Vlasovites and shoot them all after a brief trial, leaving one to tell the story. Lazarev''s character is based on a real person as well, but his real-life role was to penetrate Vlasov detachments to convince Vlasovites to give themselves up.  In the film, Lazarev voluntarily gives himself up to partisans, and two partisan leaders (of antipodal characters), Commander Lokotkov and Commissar Petushkov, put the collaborator to the test. For some partisans, he will be always a traitor and treated with suspicion, but for others this former Red Army officer, by joining the group of partisans, has to prove himself on the battlefield as a patriot and hero.

Paul Messenger (Lionel Atwill), a Wall Street tycoon, asks for Gillespie''s help in diagnosing the drastic, sudden personality changes that occur in his daughter Nancy (Helen Gilbert). Gillespie assigns Kildare to pose as an old friend of the family in order to observe Nancy. At the same time, Gillespie borrows an airplane to fly Kildare around the country collecting blood samples for Gillespie to examine around the clock.
When Gillespie collapses from exhaustion, Kildare forces the cranky old doctor to take a rest as a patient and persuades Blair head of hospital Dr. Carew (Walter Kingsford) to assign him to work full-time on the Messenger case. Kildare''s move forces Gillespie to put the project on hold, and while the old doctor goes fishing on a much needed vacation, Kildare, still hiding his identity as a doctor, begins to investigate the causes of Nancy''s symptoms. He learns that Nancy''s symptoms began to appear when she feared she had lost the love of her fiance.
While talking with Nora (Sara Haden), the family housekeeper, Kildare learns that Nancy suffers blinding headaches. Nora, who disdains all doctors because of their inability to help Nancy''s mother, has convinced Nancy that she is suffering from the same type of brain tumor that killed her mother. Nora takes Nancy to see a nature healer named John Xerxes Archley (Grant Mitchell), which prompts Kildare to admit that he is a doctor and dispute Archley''s diagnosis of a "brain tumor" but alienates him from the family. With the help of ambulance driver Joe Wayman (Nat Pendleton) and his trusty monkey wrench, Kildare gets access to Nancy, who now has hysterical blindness.
Kildare tries to consult with the vacationing Gillespie over the girl''s symptoms but is rebuffed. Gillespie returns to Blair ostensibly to give a lecture to the interns on treating psychosomatic symptoms. Following Gillespie''s advice, Kildare pretends to operate on Nancy''s eyes and arranges for the first person she sees afterwards to be her fiance, thus curing her hysterical blindness. Meanwhile, Gillespie returns from his vacation revived, and realizing that Kildare quit the experiment only out of concern for his health, reconciles with his assistant.

He is a mean-spirited director, who travels with the others by boat to a small island that is mainly used as a cemetery for deranged criminals, to have a night of fun and games. Once on the island Alan tells his group, which he refers to as his "children"— numerous stories relating to the island''s history and buried inhabitants. He leads them to a cottage where they are supposed to spend the night. He then opens a chest they had brought with them, puts on a mystical robe and says that they are to prepare for the summation at midnight. Alan takes sheer delight in torturing his cast with threats of firing them if they do not do as he pleases which always makes them go along with his plan. At midnight using a grimoire, Alan begins a séance to raise the dead after digging up the body of a man named Orville Dunworth (Seth Sklarey). Though the original intent of the ritual may have been solely as a joke, Alan appears disappointed that nothing happens.
Afterwards the party continues and Alan goes to extremes to degrade the actors, using the corpse of Orville for his own sick jokes. Then, however, animated by the fell ritual, the dead return to life and force the troupe to take refuge in the old house. Unfortunately for the group, the dead get their revenge, and in the movie''s closing credits we see the group of corpses boarding Alan''s boat with the lights of Miami in the background.','["Bob Clark"]','["Alan Ormsby","Bob Clark"]','["Alan Ormsby","Valerie Mamches","Jeff Gillen"]','["Comedy","Horror"]','5.5','["tt0068457","tt0071431","tt0071408","tt0086050","tt0071396","tt0067229","tt0076630","tt0094794","tt0101497","tt0073820","tt0067341","tt0071523"]','["zombies","living dead","low-budget","horror-comedy","Bob Clark"]','[{"url":"/Children Shouldn''t Play with Dead Things.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/ChildrenShouldntPlayWithDeadThings_201501_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','ChildrenShouldntPlayWithDeadThings_201501',10231,'Q2963591','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

('tt0052077','free','Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959)','1959','1h 19min','At the funeral of an old man''s wife, mourners are gathered by an open grave, among them her husband. Overhead, an airliner is heading toward Burbank, California. The pilot, Jeff Trent, and his co-pilot Danny are blinded by a bright light and loud noise. They look outside and see a flying saucer. The pilots follow the saucer''s flight until it lands at the graveyard, where the funeral''s gravediggers are killed by a female zombie.
At his home, lost in his thoughts of grief, the old man goes outside and (offscreen) steps in front of an oncoming car and is killed. Mourners at the old man''s funeral later discover the dead gravediggers. Inspector Daniel Clay and other police officers arrive, but Clay goes off alone to continue his investigation.
Trent and his wife Paula, who live near the graveyard, hear the sirens and Jeff tells Paula about his flying saucer encounter, stating that the army has since sworn him to secrecy. A powerful swooshing noise then knocks everyone to the ground, at both the Trent residence and the nearby graveyard, as a saucer lands. Police Inspector Clay encounters the female zombie and the reanimated corpse of the old man, and is killed by them. Upon investigating Clay''s disappearance, Lt. Harper states, "But one thing''s sure. Inspector Clay is dead, murdered, and somebody''s responsible".Newspaper headlines continue to report flying saucer sightings over Hollywood Boulevard, while a trio of saucers flies over Los Angeles. In Washington, D.C., the military fires missiles at more saucers, while the Chief of Saucer Operations, Col. Thomas Edwards, reveals that the government has been covering up saucer attacks. He mentions that one small town was annihilated, hinting at a secret history of other encounters.
The aliens return to their Space Station 7. Commander Eros informs their ruler that he has been unsuccessful in contacting Earth''s governments. To force their acknowledgment, Eros recommends implementing "Plan 9", which will resurrect recently human dead by stimulating their pituitary and pineal glands. Meanwhile Trent, about to leave on another flight, is concerned for his wife''s safety. He urges her to stay with her mother, but she insists on staying home. That night the zombie old man rises from his grave and breaks into their house. He pursues Paula outside and is joined by his zombie wife and the zombie Inspector Clay. Paula barely escapes, but then collapses after her ordeal. All three zombies return to Eros''s saucer.
At the Pentagon, Gen. Roberts informs Edwards that the government has been receiving alien messages. They explain that the aliens are trying to prevent humanity from eventually destroying the universe. The general dispatches Edwards to San Fernando, California, where most of the alien activity has occurred.
Though the undead are under alien control, zombie Clay suddenly attacks and nearly strangles Eros. The ruler closely examines zombie Clay and then orders the zombie old man destroyed in order to further frighten humanity. He then approves Eros''s Plan 9 to raise undead armies and orders they march on the capitals of Earth.
In California, the police and Edwards interview the Trents. Unknown to them, the flying saucer has returned to the graveyard. Officer Kelton encounters the zombie old man, who chases him into the Trents'' yard, where the zombie old man is hit with Eros''s ray, causing his body to rapidly decompose. Not knowing what to make of this, the Trents, Edwards and the police drive to the cemetery.
John Harper insists on leaving Paula in the car, but Paula refuses to stay alone; as a concession, Kelton stays behind. Eros and fellow alien Tanna send zombie Clay to kidnap Paula and lure the other three to their saucer. Seeing the saucer''s glow off in the distance, Trent and the police head in that direction. At the car, Kelton is knocked out by zombie Clay. Upon awakening, Kelton calls for help, and Patrolman Larry comes to his aid.
Eros allows Trent and the police to enter his saucer with their guns drawn. He then tells them human weapons development will inevitably lead to the discovery of "Solaronite", a substance that has the effect of exploding "sunlight molecules". Such an explosion would set off an uncontrollable chain reaction, destroying the entire universe. Eros now believes humans are too immature and stupid ("You see? You see? Your stupid minds. Stupid! Stupid!"), so he intends on destroying mankind. He threatens to kill Paula if Trent and the police try to force him to go with them. Officers Kelton and Larry arrive, spotting zombie Clay holding the unconscious Paula not far from the saucer. Realizing their weapons are useless, they sneak up behind Clay and club him with a length of wood, knocking him out. Eros sees this and says Clay''s controlling ray has been shut off, which allows Paula to go free. A fight then breaks out between Eros and Jeff, but the saucer''s equipment is damaged during the struggle, starting a fire aboard. The humans quickly escape, and Tanna and the unconscious Eros fly away in their now burning saucer, which finally explodes, killing them both; their zombies quickly decompose to just skeletal remains inside their clothing.','["Edward D.

Fatty''s attempts to get close to her are sidetracked when the store''s clerk Alum (Al St. John), a rival for Alice''s affections, starts a fight with the rotund butcher. Their confrontation in the store soon involves a customer (Buster Keaton) as well as Grouch. The resulting mayhem includes small bags of flour being hurled and "exploding", pies being tossed, and brooms being wildly swung amid the thick clouds of flour lingering in the air.
Determined to marry Almondine, Fatty disguises himself as a female cousin and follows her to an all-girls boarding school. Unfortunately, Alum has the same idea and masquerades, too, as a female student. After another fight breaks out between Fatty and Alum, Fatty is taken by the school''s principal Miss Teachem to a separate room to be punished. Meanwhile, Alum and his accomplices (Keaton and Joe Bordeaux) attempt to kidnap Almondine. Luckily, Fatty''s dog Luke distracts the gang while Fatty and Almondine escape. Once outside, the couple see a sign on a tree identifying a nearby parsonage, so they run off arm-in-arm to get married there.
Note that the subtitles in a later release of The Butcher Boy cite new names for the characters: Alum is "Slim Snavely" and Almondine is "Amanda".','["Roscoe ''Fatty'' Arbuckle"]','["Roscoe ''Fatty'' Arbuckle","Joseph Anthony Roach"]','["Roscoe ''Fatty'' Arbuckle","Buster Keaton","Al St. John"]','[""]','6.2','["tt0008523","tt0008112","tt0008874","tt0009466","tt0007819","tt0008377","tt0008975","tt0009123","tt0009899","tt0010221","tt0010155","tt0011071"]','["Buster Keaton, Roscoe Fatty Arbuckle, Fatty Arbuckle, Fatty, Buster, Keaton"]','[{"url":"/Buster.Keaton.The.Butcher.Boy.1917_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/busterkeatonthebutcherboy_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','busterkeatonthebutcherboy',29468,'Q8907251','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Rival criminal Pug Talbot is increasingly driven out of business. Talbot is wrathful due to the situation, and his anger causes him to abuse his own daughter, Toni. The girl has been raised to be a pickpocket and is under her father''s control.
At one point, Toni is about to be arrested, and Young helps her out. She is grateful for his help and grows very fond of him. Talbot alerts the police about one of Young''s operations, in hopes of hurting his rival''s business. Toni overhears the plan and warns Young in time. Young manages to evade the police. Talbot is furious at his treacherous daughter and beats her up. Young finds out about the abuse and vows revenge against Talbot.
Young pretends that he wants to negotiate with Talbot, and invites him for a meeting at his apartment. Talbot accepts the offer, unaware that it is a trap. When Talbot arrives from the meeting, Young has him stabbed to death. The corpse is abandoned in the street. Young offers Toni a job at his organization as a "watchdog", in exchange for room and board. Toni takes the offer and gets hired.
Young has a Chinese lover, Tu Tuan, that is suspicious over his relationship with Toni. She believes that her lover has fallen in love with the "white girl" and warns him against fruitlessly pursuing her. Worried that a jealous Tu Tuan might hurt Toni, Young removes the pickpocket from his operations. He gives Toni an allowance for her living expenses, which she sees as charity.
Away from her life of crime and with free time in her hands, Toni goes sight-seeing in London. She soon befriends pet-shop owner Eric Benton, and starts spending her afternoons with him.

He has set up shop in Monte Carlo and his partners in crime (and possible lovers) are his cousins: "Princess" Vera Petchnikoff (Busch) and "Her Highness" Olga Petchnikoff (George).
Count Karamzin begins his latest scam on the unworldly wife of an American envoy, Helen Hughes (DuPont), even though her husband is nearby. He attempts to charm her, planning to eventually fleece her of her money. She is easily impressed by his faux-aristocratic glamor, to the chagrin of her dull but sincere husband. Karamzin also has his eye on two other women, Maruschka (Fuller), a maid at the hotel, and Marietta (Polo) the mentally disabled daughter of one of his criminal associates (Gravina), seeing them both as easy sexual prey.
In the climax of the film Maruschka, the maid he has seduced and abandoned, goes mad and sets fire to a building in which Karamzin and Mrs, Hughes are trapped. Karamzin jumps to save himself, leaving Mrs Hughes in danger. She is saved, and is looked after by her devoted husband. Karamzin''s public display of selfish cowardice ensures he is shunned by the high society he craves to be accepted. Humiliated, he tries to restore his pride by seducing Marietta, the mentally disabled girl. Her father kills him, dumping his body in a sewer. Karamzin''s "cousins" are arrested for being imposters and con-artists.','["Erich von Stroheim"]','["Erich von Stroheim","Marian Ainslee"]','["Rudolph Christians","Miss DuPont","Maude George"]','["Drama","Thriller"]','7.1','["tt0015881","tt0009937","tt0019558","tt0012532","tt0015624","tt0014417","tt0016104","tt0019286","tt0011841","tt0020298","tt0018839","tt0013626"]',NULL,'[{"url":"/femminefolli.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/femminefolli1921_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/femminefolli_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','femminefolli1921',5208,'Q1116541','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Tracing her licence plate, he traces her to her home, where he reveals he is Sam''s brother. Vivian reveals that she was in Sam''s porno films. Vito is surprised as he was unaware of Sam''s involvement in that business.
Further complexities lead Vito to Warren and his wife, who both have reason to prevent the porno film seeing the light of day.

2nd Lt. Tom Cooper (William Cagney) gets the nickname "Soapy", from his friend, 1st Lt. Richard "Dick" Wood, "Woody"  (Edward J. Nugent). Tom''s trademark gift to a female friend is an inscribed bar of soap. Tom finds out that "Ida Johnson", the girl he''s been seeing while Dick has been off the base, is really Dick''s fiancée, Evelyn Worthington (June Collyer). She introduced herself as Ida (Hattie McDaniel), using her maid''s name as a lark. When Dick finds the tell-tale bar of soap from Tom, it''s no joke to him, and two friends are at odds. Dick breaks off the engagement while Evelyn is torn between two loves.
The two pilots are picked to go on a dangerous balloon mission launched into the stratosphere, to evaluate high altitude flight capability. Before they get off the ground, the tense relationship has caused friction between the former friends. The generals keep reminding them that the equipment on board is more important than they are.
When a thunderstorm takes them thousands of miles off course, the two flyers are "lost in the stratosphere". It does not look like either of them will survive until Evelyn begs them to bail out. Dick, finally realizing Tom''s innocence, knocks him out and throws him off the balloon, so he can come down safely by parachute, thereby jeopardizing his own chances of survival.

Words reach Judge Ward Young (Heydt) and his son Marshal Faron Young (Young). After a talk with Pardee (Van Cleef), they investigate with Diego (Colmans), a farmer and an old veteran with Sebastian, and then they investigate with McKane, and learned about a witness in the deal named Johnson (Lauter). Pardee tries to threaten Johnson to keep him from saying anything. Johnson tells Judge Young about the deal and agrees to testify in court.
McKane''s men ambush the lawmen and Johnson receives a dangerous wound, but tells them to look for Sebastian, who is still alive. They were overheard by Pardee, who went to interrogate with Diego and kill him.
McKane''s men follow Marshal Young and watch him survive an attack from the Comanches. They try to kill him but he manages to shoot them first. He mortally wounds Boyle and takes him to the town priest. Dying Boyle identifies the priest as Miguel Sebastian himself. Pardee arrives in town and inquires about Sebastian from a drunk named Pepe (Diamond). He tries to kill Sebastian but he was gunned down by Young.
Upon this new finding McKane was ordered to be in court. He sends his men to kill Sebastian, but he dodges them through underground passage. McKane plans a cattle stampede through town. In the trial, Sebastian testified that he was forced to give his land to McKane under death threat, and that Johnson refused to sign as a witness because it was extortion and collaboration with the enemy, but he was forced to sign. Sebastian was permitted to leave for Mexico, but Pardee tracks him and pushes him off a cliff and left him for dead. Judge Young ruled that the grant was illegal because McKane bargained with the enemy at war time, and that McKane will be sent to be court-martialed.
The court abrupts by the coming of the stampede, and McKane is caught in the stampede and was killed, along with the sheriff. Father Sebastian agrees to give the lands to the farmers.','["Albert C.

He leaves behind his fiancee, the band''s singer, Rita Wyatt (Evelyn Daw), and finds himself in the hands of studio boss B.O. Regan (Gene Lockhart), who sets a team of studio professionals to mold Rooney into a star. Regan, after struggling with another new talent who quickly developed an uncontrollable ego, also secretly insists that no one praise Rooney''s work, on pain of being fired.
While shooting a bar fight for his first film, a stunt man who is supposed to throw a fake punch at Rooney hits him deliberately instead. Rooney retaliates, and a full-out fistfight breaks out. Disgusted with Hollywood, Rooney leaves to marry Wyatt, and for a honeymoon takes her on a tramp steamer for a cruise to the South Seas, ending up in San Francisco.
While they are away, the film is completed and premiered, and becomes a huge hit – but, to Regan''s dismay, nobody in the studio knows where Rooney is. When he is finally spotted in San Francisco, Regan flies out immediately with a contract, a clause of which requires Rooney to remain single for its seven-year duration. Rooney and Wyatt agree to keep their relationship quiet, with Wyatt posing as Rooney''s secretary.
Another film is begun, with Rooney acting alongside Stephanie Hajos (Mona Barrie), and to promote it, studio publicist Hank Meyers (William Frawley) plants news stories saying that Rooney and Hajos are love interests off-screen. The combined stress of having their marriage remain a secret, while Rooney has less and less time for her, eventually drives Wyatt back to New York. Hajos finds out that Rooney is not only not interested in her but is married; the story breaks to the papers, and Rooney returns to Wyatt and their band in New York with a front-page article declaring his relationship with Hojas a hoax.','["Victor Schertzinger"]','["Victor Schertzinger","Austin Parker"]','["James Cagney","Evelyn Daw","William Frawley"]','["Comedy","Musical"]','6.3','["tt0027697","tt0037547","tt0034055","tt0042648","tt0032342","tt0025330","tt0023556","tt0045029","tt0036384","tt0032946","tt0029626","tt0033022"]','["Comedy; Musical; James Cagney"]','[{"url":"/SomethingtoSingAbout.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/SomethingtoSingAbout_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/SomethingtoSingAbout_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','SomethingtoSingAbout',14980,'Q5391482','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
('tt0050261','free','Red Nightmare (1962)','1962','29min','A man takes his American freedoms for granted, until he wakes up one morning to find out that the United States Government has been replaced with a Communist system. The basis for this short film, narrated by Jack Webb, is the alleged Soviet re-creation of US communities for the purpose of training infiltrators, spies, and moles.
The film begins in what looks like a typical American town. The camera moves back to reveal barbed wire, barricades, and soldiers in Soviet Army uniforms. Narrator Jack Webb informs us that there are several places behind the Iron Curtain used for training Soviet espionage and sabotage forces prior to infiltrating America.
Webb introduces us to a typical American family of father Jerry (Jack Kelly), wife Helen (Jeanne Cooper), and daughter Linda (Patricia Woodell, the original Bobbie Jo on Petticoat Junction) Donovan. Her boyfriend Bill Martin (Peter Brown) has been invited to dinner but while Jerry lectures Bill on football plays, Bill only has eyes for Linda. All is not well, as Jerry''s missing his PTA meeting to go bowling, and his intention to miss his Army Reserve training does not go over well with Helen. Linda and Bill inform Jerry and Helen they wish to get married but Jerry is angered and says they are too young, but he would have no objection if they waited five years after university.
Jack Webb explains how safe Jerry is in his world, but when Jerry goes to sleep, Webb looks grim and tells the audience Jerry is going to have a Red Nightmare.
Jerry awakes to find meetings in the public square about infiltrating America to bring down Capitalism. He returns home to find his daughter going to a farm collective escorted by Bill, who is now in Russian Army uniform. Helen informs Jerry that he will have to address the PTA on the glories of communism, which Jerry refuses to do, but his wife says he has no choice. At work, Jerry''s foreman (Robert Conrad) tells him that he has not met his quota and must work through the lunch break to meet it.
On Sunday morning, Jerry wakes to find his two youngest children being sent to a State Communist school against his wishes. Jerry insists on the children going to Sunday School, and takes them to their church that has been turned into a museum glorifying the Soviet Union, including many inventions made by Americans which the Soviets claim to have invented. Jerry knocks the exhibits over, and is arrested by troops led by a Commissar (Peter Breck).
Jerry is brought to trial at a Soviet tribunal (Judge, Andrew Duggan; prosecutor, Mike Road), where there is no jury nor a defense attorney. Jerry demands to know what he is charged with, but the rights Americans take for granted are long gone. After condemning testimony from several witnesses, including his own wife, Jerry is convicted and sentenced to death. When he is strapped into the execution chair, Jerry makes a speech about the Soviet people awakening one day to overthrow communism, before he gets a bullet in the head from the Commissar (the killing is offscreen).
Jerry wakes up to his freedoms and apologizes to Bill and Linda. Bill says that Jerry had a point about waiting to get married and he and Linda will do so after he finishes his enlistment in the United States Army.','["George Waggner"]',NULL,'["Jack Kelly","Jeanne Cooper","Peter Brown"]','[""]','5.2','[]','["red menace; jack webb; communisium"]','[{"url":"/JackWebb.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/JackWebb_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/RedMenace_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','RedMenace',14525,'Q5330298','wp','["Vincent Fotre"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Jimmy and his girlfriend Mary Mulvaney (Frances Gifford) try to repossess a radio, belonging to Miss Lulu Driscoll (Rita La Roy) who has not kept up her payments. But Jimmy is unaware that there are stolen jewels in the radio! It turns out the jewels are stolen from a famous movie star named Connie Hill (Anna Lisa). Since Jimmy is persistent and forces his way into her hotel room, Lulu calls the police and they arrest both him and Mary and take them to jail.
Meanwhile, Hill''s manager, John Lawrence (William Hall), strongly suspects that her fiancé Steve Brady (George Douglas) is somehow involved in the theft of Connie''s jewels. Lawrence overhears a conversation between Douglas and a man called Duke Jurgens (Paul Bryar) as they talk about a share in the robbery. Lawrence is convinced that Brady is in on the theft and goes to Skip Tracers to hire someone to get the jewels back and Jimmy''s competitor Miles, gets the assignment.
Jimmy is released from prison and happy to be free so he decides on a whim to marry Mary. He also tries to find Driscoll to repossess both the radio and the jewels but discovers that she''s moved.
Meanwhile, Hanover sees Brady abducted by The Duke and his gang. They go to Driscoll''s new residence to find the missing jewels, and discover Hanover and tie him up, while both Driscoll and Brady are put in the trunk of a car. The Duke and his men rummage through the house to find the jewels when they are interrupted by Jimmy coming for the radio. The Duke gives Jimmy the radio just to get rid of him. Jimmy finds the missing jewels inside the radio and sees the car parked outside the house. The car also happens to be on his list of items to repossess, so he tells Mary to take his car, while he takes this one back for repossession. The Duke sees Jimmy take his car and a chase ensues, ending with the police stopping both vehicles. Jimmy gets the jewels to his boss Lannigan and gets a reward for finding them.But the real crooks and the cops are soon after them again.

('tt0090163','free','Threads (1984)','1984','1h 52min','Young Sheffield residents Ruth Beckett and Jimmy Kemp plan to marry due to her unplanned pregnancy. As tensions between the US and the Soviet Union in Iran escalate, the Home Office directs Sheffield City Council to assemble an emergency operations team, which establishes itself in a makeshift bomb shelter in the basement of the town hall. After an ignored US ultimatum to the Soviets results in a brief tactical nuclear skirmish, Britain experiences fear, looting and rioting. "Subversives" including peace activists and some trade unionists are arrested and interned under the Emergency Powers Act.

Attack Warning Red is transmitted and Sheffield town hall staff react with "action, confusion and slight panic." Amidst panic, a nuclear warhead air bursts high over the North Sea, producing an electromagnetic pulse; most electrical systems throughout the UK and northwestern Europe are destroyed. The attack takes place at 9am in the UK, implying the East fires first (because it would be the middle of the night in the USA). The first missile salvos hit NATO targets, including nearby RAF Finningley. Although the city is not yet heavily damaged, chaos reigns in the streets. Jimmy is last seen running from his stalled car to reach Ruth. Sheffield is targeted by a one-megaton warhead which air bursts directly above the Tinsley Viaduct. Strategic targets, including steel and chemical factories in the Midlands, are the primary targets. Two thirds of all UK homes are destroyed, and immediate deaths range between 12 and 30 million. Of 3,000 megatons total, about 210 fall on the UK.
Sheffield Town Hall is destroyed and traps the city''s emergency operations team. They attempt to coordinate the city''s emergency and relief efforts through their few remaining short wave radios. Nuclear fallout from a ground burst at Crewe descends upon Sheffield. Jimmy''s mother succumbs to radiation sickness and severe burns after being caught by the Tinsley Viaduct explosion. Jimmy''s father searches for food and water. Fallout prevents the remaining functioning civil authorities from fighting fires or rescuing those trapped under debris. Ruth leaves her parents and grandmother in their basement, making her way to the Sheffield Royal Infirmary, where there is no electricity, running water, sanitation, or supplies. While she is absent, looters kill her parents and are executed.
By June, soldiers dig to the town hall basement but find the emergency staff have suffocated. Without the manpower or fuel to bury or burn the dead, an epidemic of communicable diseases spreads. The government authorizes capital punishment, and special courts execute criminals. The only viable currency becomes food, given as a reward for work or withheld as punishment. The millions of tons of soot, smoke and dust in the upper atmosphere trigger a nuclear winter. By July, without running water, electricity, or basic sanitation, Sheffield becomes uninhabitable. Ruth and thousands of other survivors defy official orders and leave the city. Many survivors die of radiation poisoning. Low-flying government light aircraft order them to return home. In Buxton, the police assign Ruth to a house. Once the policeman leaves, the home owner evicts her at gunpoint. At an outdoor soup kitchen, Ruth meets Bob, a pre-war acquaintance of Jimmy''s. Ruth and Bob travel together, surviving on scavenged food, including the raw carcasses of radiation poisoned livestock.
In September, Ruth partakes in the yearly harvest, accomplished using the last remaining petrol and raw human labour, but the nuclear winter keeps yields low. Ruth gives birth to her child in an abandoned barn. The army relies on rifles and tear gas for control.
Millions of people around the Northern Hemisphere have died due to radiation, fallout or the nuclear strikes. Sunlight returns, but food remains scarce due to the lack of equipment, fertilizers, and fuel. Damage to the ozone layer intensifies ultraviolet radiation, increasing cataracts and cancer.
Ten years later, Britain''s population has fallen to medieval levels of about 4 to 11 million people. Survivors work the fields using primitive hand-held farming tools. Few children have been born or raised since the attack. They speak broken English due to poor education and the breakdown of family life. Prematurely aged and blind with cataracts, Ruth collapses in a field and dies, survived by her 10-year-old daughter Jane. The country begins to recover, resuming coal mining, producing limited electricity, and using steam power. The population continues to live in near-barbaric squalor.
Three years after Ruth''s death, Jane and two boys are caught stealing food. One boy is shot in the ensuing confusion. Jane wrestles for the food with the other boy and they have sex; while Hines'' published script does not describe this as rape, it has been widely interpreted as such. Pregnant, Jane finds a makeshift hospital, gives birth to a stillborn child, and screams as she sees it; again, while Hines'' script does not describe the child as mutated, this interpretation is widespread.','["Mick Jackson"]',NULL,'["Karen Meagher","Reece Dinsdale","David Brierly"]','["Drama","Sci-Fi","War"]','8.0','["tt0085404","tt0059894","tt0090315","tt7149818","tt0086429","tt0091759","tt0087090","tt0097889","tt0099197","tt0089714","tt0089869","tt8254092"]','["threads","nukes","armageddo"]','[{"url":"/threads.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/threads_201712_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','threads_201712',101638,'Q1412119','wp','["Barry Hines"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Inside the mansion, Violet Stonor screams in her bedroom and then collapses in the hallway. She is discovered by her sister, Helen (Angela Baddeley). Violet''s dying words are "the band, speckled." She then dies and their stepfather, Dr. Grimesby Rylott (Lyn Harding), arrives.
Soon there is an inquest into the mysterious death, and Rylott plots with the housekeeper and his Indian servant, Ali. Watson attends the inquest as an old friend of the Stonor family in India. He acts protectively to Helen and advises her to consult Holmes if she ever feels in danger. At Baker Street later, Watson summarises the inquest to Holmes, describing the various witnesses and evidence. Holmes files it away in his system—he operates a modern office with female secretaries and a voice recording device.
One year later, Helen Stonor is engaged, and her fiancé must leave for a plantation in Rangoon for a year. Helen is afraid and suggests that they marry sooner, so that she may go with him to Rangoon. Dr. Rylott is upset by these plans and decides to murder her to prevent the loss of her inheritance. Rylott forces Helen to move from her room into Violet''s old room. The next day, Helen meets with Holmes and Watson in Baker Street they describe her case. Her sister Violet had been engaged to be married before she dies, and Helen remembers hearing mysterious music that night. Now Helen is engaged and is also hearing the mysterious music again. Holmes questions her and sends her out of the room through a separate entrance when her stepfather arrives. Dr. Rylott barges in and threatens Holmes, but he is not deterred.
In the afternoon, Dr. Watson arrives alone to visit Helen Stonor while her stepfather is not home. Holmes is in disguise as a workman dealing with the repairs to the building. Together they investigate Dr. Rylott''s room and discover several clues, such as a bowl of milk, a dog whip, and a mirror. Next, they investigate Violet''s room, which has a bell-rope that doesn''t ring and a ventilator near the bed. The ventilator opens into Rylott''s room but is hidden by a painting. When Rylott returns, Holmes and Watson temporarily leave Helen at the house but plan to sneak into the room later to investigate.
That night, Helen spends the night within Violet''s room while Holmes and Watson secretly keep watch with her. After snake-charming music plays, a snake enters the room through the ventilator, and Holmes attacks it, sending it back to Rylott''s room. Rylott screams. Holmes, Watson, and Helen enter his room and discover Rylott dead from a snake bite. Holmes forces Ali, the servant, to charm the snake so they can put it in the safe. Violet''s last words about a "speckled band" were in fact describing "a swamp adder, the deadliest snake in India". The venomous snake had been sent to Violet''s room by Dr. Rylott to murder her for her inheritance. Rylott had intended to do the same to Helen.
The movie ends with Holmes conducting an experiment in Baker Street. Watson arrives dressed for a wedding, and Holmes therefore deduces that he is going to a wedding. Watson is pleased to tell Holmes that he is wrong, that he has just come from the wedding of Helen Stonor and her groom. Holmes offers his "condolences" rather than congratulations. Watson says in amusement that "we all come to it", meaning marriage. After Watson leaves, Holmes disagrees quietly, "Not all, my dear Watson... not all".','["Jack Raymond"]','["Arthur Conan Doyle","W.P.

They open it and discover bundles of cash. With Jane at the wheel, they are chased by another car driven, Alan deduces, by the person who was supposed to receive the money. Jane drives recklessly, making a high speed turn and zig-zagging on the difficult road.  They manage to lose their pursuer and Alan takes over. As they drive back into town, they discuss what to do about the money.  Jane wants to keep it but Alan feels it is probably a blackmail payoff and the police should have it.  He has a chance to hand it over, but does not, when an officer stops him for failing to use his turn signal.  Back at their Hollywood apartment, they examine what Alan estimates to be $100,000 in cash. Jane eventually convinces her husband that they should hide the cash for a week; she claims to be fine with whatever he decides to do. They stash the satchel at the baggage claim at Union Station, the claim ticket seemingly ends up in the lining of Alan''s coat.
The next day, while Alan is at work and as Jane is hiding packages containing things she has purchased with the money in mind, Danny (Duryea) shows up. He claims to be a detective and says he needs to look around the place.  He does not say why and he has no warrant, but says he can get one if that is what she prefers.  She allows him to go ahead.  He discovers the packages, one containing a fur coat, and says, "So you''ve already started spending it, huh?". Clearly not a detective but actually the man for whom the money was intended, Danny slaps Jane around a bit and demands to know where the money is.  She lies, telling him that she and Alan have surrendered it to the police.  He promises to return if there is no news in the evening paper about money being handed over to the cops.  Alan returns home and tells her their banker phoned to let him know that their account is several hundred dollars down.  She responds that she has only been buying things she needed.  Alan threatens to send the claim ticket to the District Attorney''s office right away; Jane threatens to take the money and run off.  During their argument, he brings up her previous marriage to a man named Blanchard, who apparently died by suicide, and immediately is sorry.  Jane feels she was always meant to have money, that she married Blanchard because she thought he had a lot of it; Alan believes peace of mind is more important, that they will not have that with the money in their possession.  Nevertheless, he agrees to hang on to it for the rest of the agreed-to week.  He suggests that the next evening they go out together and enjoy themselves the way they used to. 
Danny returns the next day, letting himself into the apartment using a skeleton key.  Jane tells him that Alan has the money and is planning to give it to the authorities.  She explains how she does not intend to allow him to do that, that she is determined to keep it.  She and Danny make a deal to split the money; he gives her a number where he can be reached.  Later, when she has made up her mind about what to do, Jane phones Danny and tells him to wait that night at the palm tree at the west end of Westlake Park, near downtown Los Angeles.   
As part of their romantic evening, Alan and Jane rent a boat.  Inside her purse, Jane has packed her husband''s gun.  While out on the water, she appears to feel a pang of guilt; she blurts out that she wants to give the money up, that she wants to send the claim ticket in right away.  Alan tries to take his wife''s mind off the topic.  He wants a cigarette and picks up her purse to look for some; his gun falls out. A struggle ensues and Alan is shot dead. Jane takes control of the boat and, as per their arrangement, meets Danny.  He sees the body and resists being involved in a murder, but Jane has the gun on him and promises to tell the police he killed her husband unless he helps her.  
After dumping the body in the lake, weighted by the boat''s anchor, Jane and Danny leave the boat launch together - he has on Alan''s coat and hat - so as to mislead witnesses into assuming she left with her husband. She extends the ruse by having Danny drive back to her apartment; she makes sure the parking garage attendant believes Alan is in the car.  Having arranged to meet Danny later that night, to supposedly retrieve the money from its burial site, Jane first invites Alan''s sister, Kathy (Kristine Miller) - who lives across the hall - over for a nightcap.  She tells Kathy that Alan has just gone out to pick up a bottle of liquor.  As time goes on and Alan does not return, Jane begins to feign worry and fear.  She phones the police to report him as a missing person. Kathy realizes that the couple has plenty of liquor in the apartment and questions why Alan would have gone to purchase more.  Jane tries to tell her sister-in-law that their marriage is on the rocks.  Kathy does not buy this and says she believes Alan will be home soon.   
When Kathy goes home, Jane picks up Danny and they drive up into the hills. Once up there, he figures that she plans to kill him.  After a near-accident and she stops the car, Danny flees, after saying, "You didn''t bury that dough, and I know it".  He is still wearing the coat that has in its lining the claim ticket.  Jane abandons the car. Later, she locates Danny''s residence and goes there, asking for Alan''s coat.  Danny discovers a blank piece of paper in the lining and Jane realizes the ticket must be at home.    
Meanwhile, having used her personal key to the Palmer''s apartment, Kathy is searching the place; she has her suspicions about Jane. She finds the claim ticket in a dresser drawer.  As she opens the door to leave, she comes face-to-face with a man who introduces himself as Don Blake (DeFore), an old Army Air Corps buddy of Alan''s on vacation in Los Angeles. Kathy tells him that Alan is missing.   
Later, while Jane is looking around her apartment for the claim ticket, a police lieutenant comes to report that the Palmer vehicle was in a near-accident the previous night and that a man got out of the car and left the scene.  The implication is that it was Alan and another woman. The vehicle has been located and the matter appears to be closed, but not for Kathy, who all but says that she has doubts about her sister-in-law.  Don arrives and, in the course of their conversation, Jane quizzes him on his experience in England with Alan during the war; his answers are not convincing.  After he leaves, Jane phones a man she knows for certain served with Alan and asks him to drop by. Danny makes another appearance; Jane tells him about Kathy and begs him to procure poison to kill her.    
Don and Kathy are drawn to each other.  She wonders why he is so anxious to help find Alan and yet does not talk about him as if they really were friends in England.  A drunken Danny returns with the poison and, after rambling for a few minutes, leaves.  Don stops by Kathy''s to ask her out for dinner.  She shows him the claim ticket, asking him to take her to Union Station afterwards.  Don is intrigued and suggests they go right away.  Jane interrupts the couple as they are leaving and tells them a lie about a note from Alan she has found in the returned car. Alan, she says, is in Mexico and she is going there to find him. She asks them to come to her apartment, where the man who actually was an air corps comrade of Alan''s is waiting.  It is evident that Don has been lying.  Jane holds a gun on him and retrieves the ticket; her sister-in-law runs back to her own apartment to call police, then subsequently finds Don unconscious in Jane''s apartment.  She notifies police to stake out Union Station.  When Don wakes up, he confesses to Kathy that he does not know her brother, but he will explain further later.   
Jane manipulates a stranger into claiming the bag of cash, then goes to Danny''s.  He is hungover and leery of her. She asks him to help her run away but she needs to know where the money came from and if it is safe to spend. Danny says it was a "once in a lifetime" blackmail payoff from an insurance scam. She understands this means the money is unmarked and its disappearance won''t be reported to the police. She kills Danny with a drink laced with the poison he had provided her.   
After finding Danny''s body, the Los Angeles police tell Don that if he wants the small lake at Westlake Park dragged in search of Jane''s missing husband, it''ll cost thousands of dollars; besides, they don''t believe his theories. Jane flees with the money to Mexico City, where she has a penthouse at the posh Reforma Hotel. Don turns up at her door. Concluding he is either after the money or with the police, Jane pleads with him to take half. Don tells her he is the brother of Jane''s first husband, Blanchard, that "this is a vendetta, but it''s over now", that now that he knows her, he understands how she could have driven his brother to kill himself. As Mexican police detectives rush into the room, Jane holds them at bay with her gun; in tears, she backs away onto a balcony, where she trips. She falls over the railing, screaming, to her death. Don meets Kathy in the lobby and apologizes, saying, "Well, it was a short honeymoon, Kathy.  We''re going home now".','["Byron Haskin"]','["Roy Huggins","Roy Huggins"]','["Lizabeth Scott","Don DeFore","Dan Duryea"]','["Crime","Drama","Film-Noir","Mystery","Thriller"]','7.3','["tt0043142","tt0040695","tt0038988","tt0047878","tt0039305","tt0044789","tt0045465","tt0042707","tt0044417","tt0039482","tt0045216","tt0037469"]','["noir;suspense;murder;crime"]','[{"url":"/TooLateForTears_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/Too_Late_for_Tears_1949.mp4","format":"h.264"}]','TooLateForTears',217528,'Q1198412','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

('tt0015361','free','Stachka (1925)','1925','1h 22min','The film opens with a quotation from Vladimir Lenin: 

The strength of the working class is organization. Without organization of the masses, the proletarian is nothing. Organized it is everything. Being organized means unity of action, unity of practical activity.

На заводе всё спокойно / At the factory all is quietUsing typography, the word "но" (but) is added to the title of the chapter which then animates and dissolves into an image of machinery in motion.
The administration is spying on the workers, reviewing a list of agents with vivid code names. Vignettes are shown of them. Conditions are tense with agitators and bolsheviks planning a strike prior to the catalytic event.
Повод к стачке / Reason to strikeA micrometer is stolen, with a value of 25 rubles or 3 weeks pay. A worker, Yakov, is accused of the theft and subsequently hangs himself. Fighting ensues and work stops. The workers leave the milling room running and resistance is met at the foundry. The strikers throw rocks and loose metal through the foundry windows. Then locked within the gates of the complex, the crowd confronts the office. They force open the gates and seize a manager carting him off in a wheel barrow dumping them down a hill into the water. The crowd disperses.

Завод замер / The factory dies downThe chapter begins with footage of ducklings, kittens, piglets, and geese. A child then wakes his father for work ironically with no work to do, they laugh and frolic. The factory is shown vacant and still with birds moving in. The children act out what their fathers had done, wheelbarrowing a goat in a mob. The owner is frustrated by orders arriving and the frozen plant. Demands are formulated: an 8-hour work day, fair treatment by the administration, 30% wage increases, and a 6-hour day for minors. The shareholders get involved with the director and read the demands. They discuss dismissively while smoking cigars and having drinks. Presumably on the orders of the shareholders, the police raid the workers, and they sit down to protest. At their meeting the shareholders use the demand letter as a rag to clean up a spill, and a lemon squeezer metaphorically represents the pressure the stockholders intend to apply to the strikers.

Стачка затягивается / The strike draws out
Scenes are shown of a line forming at a store which is closed, and a baby needing food. A fight occurs at a home between a man and a woman, subsequently she leaves. Another man rummages through his home for goods to sell at a flea market, upsetting his family. A posted letter publicly shows the administrators rejection of the demands. Using a hidden camera in a pocket watch, a spy named "Owl" photographs someone stealing the letter. The pictures are transferred to another spy. The man is beaten, captured, and beaten again.
Провокация на разгром / Provocation and debacleThe scene opens with dead cats dangling from a structure.
A character is introduced, "King" whose throne is made of a derelict automobile amidst rubbish, and who leads a community that lives in enormous barrels buried with only their top openings above ground. After a deal with a tsarist police agent, "King" hires a few provocateurs from among his community to set fire, raze, and loot a liquor store. A crowd gathers at the fire and the alarm is sounded. The crowd leaves to avoid being provoked but are set upon by the firemen with their hoses regardless.
Ликвидация / ExterminationThe governor sends in the military. A child walks under the soldiers'' horses and his mother goes under to get him and is struck. Rioting commences, and the crowd is chased off through a series of gates and barriers heading to the forge, then their apartments. The crowd is chased and whipped on the balconies. A policeman murders a small child. The workers are driven into a field by the army and shot en masse. This is shown with alternating footage of the slaughtering of a cow.','["Sergei M.

His classmates Jeb Stuart (Errol Flynn) and George Custer (Ronald Reagan) become second lieutenants and are posted to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas Territory, the most dangerous duty in the army—an assignment they relish. On the way to Kansas, Custer and Stuart meet Cyrus K. Holliday, in charge of building the railroad to Santa Fe, New Mexico, and his daughter Kit (Olivia de Havilland), with whom both officers fall in love.
The Kansas Territory is bloodstained and war-torn, a victim of John Brown''s (Raymond Massey) relentless crusade against slavery. Meanwhile, Rader has enlisted as a mercenary in Brown''s army, which has been terrorizing the countryside. During Brown''s attack on a freight wagon under the protection of the U.S. Army, Stuart and Custer capture Brown''s injured son Jason (Gene Reynolds) and, before he dies, the troubled boy informs them about his father''s hideout at Shubel Morgan''s ranch in Palmyra. In disguise, Stuart rides into Palmyra, the center of the Underground Railroad, but Brown''s men spot his horse''s  army brand. He is captured and taken to Brown at gunpoint. Attempting to escape, Stuart is trapped in a burning barn but is saved as Custer leads the cavalry to the rescue, driving Brown into seclusion.
Three years later, in 1859, believing that Brown''s force has been broken, Stuart and Custer are sent back to Washington, D.C., where Stuart proposes to Kit. However, Brown is planning to re-ignite war by raiding the arsenal at Harper''s Ferry, Virginia. When Brown refuses to pay Rader for his services, Rader rides to Washington to alert Stuart of Brown''s plans, and the troops arrive just in time to crush the rebellion. Brown is then tried for treason by the state of Virginia and hanged.

The owner of the cinema, Karl Verloc (Oscar Homolka), enters through a back entrance to the living quarters above, and pretends to have been asleep and not know anything of the blackout. His wife, Mrs. Verloc (Sylvia Sidney) comes to get him and is surprised to see him, but he informs her that he had been sleeping the entire time. He instructs his wife to return the money to the customers – against her protests – because he has "some money coming in."  As the money is about to be disbursed to the customers downstairs, the lights go back on. It is revealed that sand was put in the boilers as an act of sabotage on London''s electricity grid.
The next day, Verloc meets with his contact and it is revealed that he is part of a gang of terrorists from an unnamed European country who are planning a series of attacks in London, though their exact motives are not made clear. Verloc''s contact is disappointed that the newspapers mocked the short loss of electricity, and instructs Verloc to place a parcel of "fireworks" at the Piccadilly London Underground station. Verloc tells the contact that he is not comfortable with any act that would cause the loss of life.
Meanwhile, Scotland Yard suspects Verloc''s involvement in the plot and assigns Detective Sergeant Ted Spencer (John Loder) to investigate Verloc. Spencer is initially undercover as a greengrocer''s helper next to the cinema, and befriends Mrs. Verloc and her little brother, Stevie (Desmond Tester), who lives with them, by treating them to a fancy dinner. At this point, Spencer and Scotland Yard are unsure whether Mrs. Verloc is complicit in the terrorist plots or merely innocently unaware.
Verloc goes to a bird shop to meet his contact, who is also a bomb-maker. The contact tells Verloc the time and place of where he must deliver the bomb – all Verloc has to do is place the bomb at Piccadilly Circus tube station on Saturday, as it is a time bomb that will already be set to explode at 1:45 p.m. that day. Later that night, the associates of the terrorist group are having a meeting in Verloc''s living room above the cinema. Detective Spencer attempts to eavesdrop on the conversation, but he is found. His cover is blown by one of the terrorist associates, and Verloc realises that the police are investigating him. The meeting ends abruptly and the members scatter, worried that they are all being followed. Verloc tells his wife the police are investigating him, and he confirms with the greengrocer that Spencer was with Scotland Yard.
The next day, the canaries are delivered to Verloc – a present for Stevie – and the bomb is located within their cage. Detective Spencer shows up with Stevie and tells Mrs. Verloc of Scotland Yard''s suspicions that he is involved in sabotage. Verloc sees his wife and Spencer talking, and becomes nervous. Before Spencer comes to question Verloc, he tells Stevie to deliver a film canister to the cloak room under Piccadilly Circus, but Stevie is unknowingly carrying the time bomb for Verloc. Stevie is delayed by several events, including The Lord Mayor''s Show procession. Stevie manages to talk himself aboard a bus, even though it is forbidden to transport flammable nitrocellulose film on public vehicles. The bomb explodes while Stevie is still aboard the bus.
Verloc confesses to his wife but blames Scotland Yard and Spencer for Stevie''s death, saying that they were the ones who prevented Verloc from successfully carrying out the bomb delivery himself. Soon afterwards, as Verloc and his wife are preparing to eat dinner, she stabs him to death with a knife. When Spencer arrives to arrest Verloc he realises what has happened, but insists that she shouldn''t admit that she stabbed her husband. Nevertheless, she starts to confess to a police inspector. Meanwhile, at this very moment, the terrorist bomb maker sneaks into Verloc''s flat to retrieve the birdcage that had been used to deliver the bomb out of fear that it might incriminate him. The police surround the building, and just as Mrs. Verloc blurts out that her husband is dead, the bomb-maker detonates a bomber-coat he wears in the event he is about to be caught. The explosion destroys all evidence of the death and confuses the inspector about whether it was before or after the explosion that she told him, "My husband is dead!"','["Alfred Hitchcock"]','["Joseph Conrad","Charles Bennett"]','["Sylvia Sidney","Oskar Homolka","Desmond Tester"]','["Crime","Thriller"]','7.1','["tt0029811","tt0028231","tt0025452","tt0032484","tt0026029","tt0035279","tt0031505","tt0019702","tt0030341","tt0017075","tt0034248","tt0042994"]','["Mystery; Thriller; Hitchcock; Sabotage; Terrorism"]','[{"url":"/Sabotage.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/Sabotage_1936_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/Sabotage_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','Sabotage_1936',164813,'Q500488','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

In Abilene, one of the biggest cattle towns of the west, the town is on the brink of a confrontation between the cattlemen and the homesteaders.
Marshal Dan Mitchell (Randolph Scott) has the job of keeping the peace between the two groups. For a long time, the town has been divided, with the cattlemen and cowboys having one side of the main street to themselves, while townspeople occupied the other side. Mitchell liked it this way, it made things easier for him, and kept problems from arising between the two factions. However, when homesteaders decide to lay stakes on the edge of town that balance is upset, and leads to a deadly showdown.
The leader of the homesteaders is Henry Dreiser (Lloyd Bridges), a young man with good common sense, and the local sheriff is Bravo Trimble (Edgar Buchanan), a lawman who would rather play cards than be involved in any confrontation. Mitchell not only has the difficult job of juggling the upcoming confrontation, but also his love life, which is divided between Rita (Ann Dvorak), a showgirl who works on the cowboys'' side of the street, and Sherry (Rhonda Fleming), the churchgoing daughter of a shopkeeper on the other side of the street.','["Edwin L.

A Commissar named Furmanov is delegated to the division from Moscow, and although he initially does not get along with Chapaev, he proves his worth by resolving a conflict that arises when Chapaev''s men steal from local peasants and the two become good friends.
With the help of Chapaev''s adjutant Petka and the machine gunner Anka (who develop a love interest over the course of the film), and with intelligence provided by Borodzin''s defecting aide Petrovich, the division manages to repel an attack from the White Army troops.
Higher – ups in Moscow re-assign Furmanov to another Red Army division, and the situation soon deteriorates. Under the cover of darkness, Borodzin and his men attack Chapaev''s headquarters. Despite their heroic efforts, Petka and Chapaev are killed.

Wellington Wimpy on board. Sindbad orders his huge roc to kidnap Popeye''s girlfriend, Olive Oyl, and wreck Popeye''s ship, forcing him and Wimpy to swim to shore. Sinbad relishes making Olive his trophy wife, which is interrupted by Popeye''s arrival. Sinbad then challenges the one-eyed sailor to a series of obstacles to prove his greatness, including fighting the roc, a two-headed giant named Boola (an apparent parody reference to The Three Stooges), and Sindbad himself. Popeye makes short work of the bird and the giant, but Sindbad almost gets the best of him until Popeye produces his can of spinach, which gives him the power to soundly defeat Sindbad and proclaim himself "the most remarkable, extraordinary fella."
A subtly dark running gag features the hamburger-loving Wimpy chasing after a duck on the island with a meat grinder, with the intention of grinding it up so that he can fry it into his favorite dish, but the duck not only escapes, but also snatches away Wimpy''s last burger in retaliation when he gives up.

He summons François Barras (Richard Hart), the only man who can nominate him before the National Convention. Barras refuses to do so and goes into hiding.
Meanwhile, patriot Charles D''Aubigny (Robert Cummings) secretly kills and impersonates Duval (Charles Gordon), the bloodstained prosecutor of Strasbourg, who had been summoned to Paris by Robespierre for some unknown purpose (which Robespierre''s enemies want very much to ascertain). Neither Robespierre nor Fouché (Arnold Moss), the chief of his secret police, have met Duval before, so the substitution goes undetected. Robespierre informs D''Aubigny that his black book, containing the names of those he intends to denounce and have executed, has been stolen. Robespierre''s numerous foes are kept in check by the uncertainty of whether their names are on the list. If they were to learn for certain that they are, they would band together against him. He gives D''Aubigny authority over everyone in France, save himself, and 24 hours to retrieve the book.
D''Aubigny meets Barras (Richard Hart) through his sole contact, Madelon (Arlene Dahl), whom D''Aubigny once loved. However, he was followed, and Barras is arrested by the police, led by Saint-Just. D''Aubigny finds himself in an uncomfortable position, but manages to allay the suspicions of both sides that he has betrayed them.
He goes to visit Barras in prison, and informs him that three of his best men have been murdered. Strangely, their rooms had not been ransacked to search for the book, leading D''Aubigny to surmise that it was never stolen in the first place, and that Robespierre is using the alleged theft to distract his foes. Saint-Just, still suspicious, sends for Duval''s wife to identify her husband. Through quick thinking, Madelon pretends to be Madame Duval and extricates her former lover just before the real Madame Duval arrives.
Before news of his impersonation gets out, D''Aubigny returns to Robespierre''s private office to look for the book. There he encounters the opportunistic Fouché, who is seemingly willing to sell out his master. When D''Aubigny finds the book, however, Fouché tries to stab him. D''Aubigny strangles him into unconsciousness and escapes.
He and Madelon hide out at the farmhouse of a fellow conspirator, but their location is extracted through torture. A nighttime chase ensues. D''Aubigny gets away, but Madelon is caught, taken back to Paris, and tortured. She refuses to talk.
As the Convention is about to convene the next day, Fouché shows up and offers to trade Madelon for the book. D''Aubigny turns him down. The book is passed from hand to hand among the delegates. Thus, when Robespierre arrives to denounce Barras, the crowd turns on him instead. He nearly brings the mob to heel with his golden words, but Fouché has his henchman shoot Robespierre through the jaw, silencing him. Robespierre is taken to meet Madame Guillotine.
D''Aubigny searches Robespierre''s office, finds a secret room, and rescues Madelon. Fouché falls into conversation with an army officer as the crowd celebrates the death of Robespierre. Fouché, about to take leave of the officer, asks his name. The man replies, "Bonaparte. Napoleon Bonaparte."

Twenty years later the boy, now going by Brother Jin, has grown up to be a road construction worker like his father. He and his friends - Old Zhang, Zhang Da, Little Luo, and Zheng Junli, are having trouble finding work in the city after being fired over a fight between Brother Jin and Old Zhang. As they search for employment, they meet Little Six, a former thief who joins their group. The group decide to join the road construction team to participate in the building of an important military road. During their travels through China constructing the road, the group meets two women — Ding Xiang and Jasmine. As the military situation in the area grows more intense, the road workers and soldiers stay up all night and work together constructing the road. 
Eventually, the enemy approaches Hu, a local rich man, and persuades him to convince the men to stop building the road. Hu invites Brother Jin and the other workers to a banquet at his house and proceeds to offer them goods in an attempt to persuade them to give up on the road. During the banquet Brother Jin and his friends refuse Hu''s request. The six workers are imprisoned in Hu''s basement, tied up, beaten and tortured. Dingxiang and Jasmine begin to suspect something may have happened when the men don''t return from the banquet. The next day, Ding Xiang and Jasmine enter the Hu''s house to rescue Brother Jin and the others. Jasmine seduces Hu, and while he is distracted, Ding Xiang and Jasmine go to the kitchen. Jasmine threatens the servant with scissors, to bring them to where the prisoners are being kept. Ding Xiang goes to inform Chief Liu and the army, and get help. Meanwhile, Brother Jin uses the scissors to cut himself free and the rest of his group. He is caught by a guard, and Old Zhang sacrifices himself during the rescue. The army and other workers rally to go to Hu''s house and rescue the prisoners. They force themselves into the house, and capture Hu. 
After Brother Jin and his friends return to the village, the local garrison reports and punishes the traitors. Once the group begin working on the road again an enemy plane suddenly attacks and kills most of the workers along with Moli. Dingxiang stands with her father in the aftermath of the attack.

Exchanging credentials with a Jamaican Inspector, Warren reveals he has come to seek the extradition of a wanted criminal known as "The Professor".  Surprised when the Inspector refuses to extradite the Professor, the Jamaican Inspector recounts a story told in flashback.
Devil may care adventurer Brannigan has won the ship Manfish and its first mate Swede in a poker game but keeps away from the Manfish''s creditors.  During a drunken evening out Brannigan is attracted to a woman sitting with an older man called "the Professor" with the two brawling over her.  During the brief fracas Brannigan notices the Professor is wearing an unusual heavy ring of a skull and cross bones.
The next day the Manfish is at sea engaging in a turtle hunt.  Two divers from the ship find a skeleton underwater holding a bottle. Brannigan swims to the skeleton and grabs the bottle.  He breaks it open on board finding a ripped piece of paper dated 1793 with nonsensical French written on it, but inside the bottle is the same ring that the Professor wears.
Tracking down the Professor, Brannigan persuades him to tell what he knows revealing it is half of a document by the pirate Jean Lafitte with the professor holding the other half.
Fearing for his life but clever and greedy, the Professor translates the map to reveal a treasure is on the island of Hispaniola but the Professor insures his safety by destroying the map and memorising the contents.  Once on the island a treasure worth £25,000 is recovered but the Professor promises it is a drop in the ocean compared to another treasure buried later by Lafitte that the Professor says he can locate.','["W.

It intercepts a man who''s driving his car down an isolated road. The object takes over the man''s body and directs it to LabCentral, a U.S. research facility that''s been tracking the saucer, thinking it was an asteroid.
The man''s possessed body forces its way into the lab and the entity inside takes control of the chief scientist, who directs three nuclear missiles to be fired at the saucer. Everyone is shocked when the explosion fails to destroy the object. The saucer crashes into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Mexico. Impatient with the delay in getting a formal expedition to the crash scene, two of the lab''s scientists (one with his photographer girlfriend in tow) head down to Mexico. After their arrival, they see the saucer appear on the ocean''s surface. Terrified, they flee back to their lodging for the rest of the night.
The next morning the scientists (and a photographer/girlfriend) see a large, stories-tall machine that has appeared on the beach. Its four-legged body features two mobile antennae that resemble the terminals of a capacitor. They use a small helicopter to land atop the strange machine, glimpsing its complex inner workings before being forced to leave.
Under the direction of the possessed chief scientist, who now has lists of power stations and atom-bomb arsenals around the world, the machine, which has since been named Kronos, methodically attacks power plants in Mexico, draining all their energy. In doing so Kronos grows larger with every energy-absorption episode, consuming more and more power as it moves, unhindered, from one power source to the next. Four Mexican Air Force fighter planes attack, but the ever-growing alien machine easily destroys them and continues on its energy-draining rampage.
In a lucid, unpossessed moment, the chief scientist tells his returned colleagues that Kronos is an energy accumulator, sent by an alien race that has exhausted its own natural resources; they have sent their giant machine to drain all the Earth''s available power and then return it to their dying world.
The United States Air Force sends a B-47 bomber to drop an atomic bomb, but one of the scientists warns the Pentagon that an atomic explosion will simply supply Kronos with massive amounts of energy. The Pentagon attempts to abort the bombing mission, but Kronos causes the jet to crash into it, absorbing the bomb''s nuclear blast. The alien machine, now grown to an immense size, appears unstoppable, harvesting all forms of energy at will.
As Kronos draws near Los Angeles, scientists devise an ingenious plan that reverses the monster machine''s polarity, forcing it to feed upon itself, until being obliterated by a gigantic implosion. But the question remains: Will mankind suffer another onslaught by the desperate aliens?','["Kurt Neumann"]','["Lawrence L.

After cautiously investigating the signal, they find that it was made by a white man, George Tweed, the last survivor of the original garrison at Guam. Tweed relates his harrowing story of how he survived in the bush for 31 months with the help of the natives, Chamorros.
The narrator then tells the audience that the island of Guam means much to the people of America, none more so than the Chamorros sailors on the convoy. The film, through the voice of a Chammoro, relates how good life was on the island, how the US had opened schools and clinics for the natives and trained them for self-government.
Then, on 11 December 1941, the island is assaulted by a huge force of Japanese planes and ships. The outnumbered garrison of about 500 men defends the island, but to little avail, and contact is lost with the mainland within hours. The American people and Chamorro diaspora don''t know what happened to the friends and relatives on the island.
So the long process of industrial rearmament and "island hopping" begins with each element being scorned by a "Japanese" man with a radio speaker in silhouette behind a curtain. And then the island is taken. Surprisingly little is actually shown of the battle, but Tweed is shown talking to some of his superiors about the experience of the Chamorros on the island, the brutality and torture that the Japanese inflicted on them, and several photographs of Chamorro severed heads are shown, with the narrator explaining why each was decapitated.','["Richard Brooks"]',NULL,NULL,'[""]','5.4','["tt0037468","tt0064405","tt0084920","tt0059399","tt0076327","tt0089139","tt0072705","tt0042352","tt0046398","tt0043743","tt0050993","tt0056541"]','["WWII"]','[{"url":"/ReturntoGuam_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/ReturntoGuam_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','ReturntoGuam',2364,'Q7317293','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

He remembers a time when he was bitter about squandering his musical talent working in a cheap nightclub. After his girlfriend Sue Harvey (Claudia Drake), the nightclub vocalist, leaves to seek fame in Hollywood, he sinks into depression. After some anguish, he decides to go to California and marry her; with little money, though, he is forced to hitchhike his way across the country.
In Arizona, bookie Charles Haskell Jr. (Edmund MacDonald) gives the tired and disheveled Al a ride in his convertible and tells him that he is in luck: he is driving all the way from Florida to Los Angeles to place a bet on a horse. During the drive, he has Al pass him pills on several occasions, which he swallows as he drives. That night, Al drives while Haskell sleeps. When a rainstorm forces Al to pull over to put up the convertible''s top, he is unable to rouse Haskell. Al opens the passenger-side door and Haskell tumbles out, striking his head on a rock. Al then realizes the bookie is dead. Fearful that the police will believe he killed Haskell, Al drags the body off the road. After considering his options, and with fear of arrest his greatest concern, he takes the dead man''s money, clothes, and identification, and drives away, intent on abandoning the car near Los Angeles.
He crosses into California after answering questions posed by the police and spends a night in a motel. The next day, as he leaves a gas station near Desert Center Airport, he picks up a hitchhiker, Vera (Ann Savage). At first, she travels silently with Al, who has identified himself as Haskell, then suddenly challenges his identity and ownership of the car. She reveals she had been picked up by Haskell earlier in Louisiana; she got out in Arizona after he tried to force himself on her. Al tells her how Haskell died, but she blackmails him by threatening to turn him over to the police. She takes the money that Al retrieved from Haskell''s wallet and wants whatever money they can get by selling the car.
In Hollywood, they rent an apartment, posing as Mr. and Mrs. Haskell, to provide an address when they sell the car. They spend a fractious time together in the apartment, Al resentful of the situation, but Vera reveling in having the upper hand. When they are about to sell the car, Vera learns from a newspaper that Haskell''s wealthy father is near death and a search is under way for his long-estranged son. Vera demands that Al impersonate Haskell once the father dies, and position himself to inherit the estate. Al refuses, arguing that impersonation requires detailed knowledge he lacks.
Back at the apartment, Vera gets drunk and they begin arguing again. In a drunken rage, she threatens to call the police, running into the bedroom with the telephone and locking the door, falling on the bed with the telephone cord tangled around her neck. From the other side of door, Al pulls on the cord in an effort to break it from the phone. As Vera fails to respond as he yells her name, he breaks down the door and discovers Vera strangled by the telephone cord.
Al gives up the idea of contacting his girlfriend Sue again and returns to hitchhiking, instead. He later finds out that Haskell is wanted in connection to the murder of his wife, Vera. Back in the framing narrative in the diner in Reno where the film opened, he imagines his inevitable arrest by the police.','["Edgar G.

Adoption agent Mr. Jordan (Edmund Gwenn) warns the couple that he would need to investigate them thoroughly. Harry looks curiously at Jordan, something that worries Jordan.
Harry and Eve live in San Francisco and are co-owners of a business, with Harry traveling to Los Angeles frequently for work. Jordan arrives at Harry''s Los Angeles office looking for information about Harry. The receptionist calls around to all the hotels, but none of them have a Harry Graham registered. One or two of the managers remembers Harry, but he hadn''t been checked into their hotels in months. Jordan is very puzzled and even more adamant about investigating Harry. He finds a letter opener on Harry''s desk with the name ''Harrison'' Graham.  Jordan visits the address listed for that name in the phone book and there finds Harry, with a wife and a baby. When Jordan is about to call the police, Harry tells him how he got into the situation.
Upon learning of Eve''s infertility, Harry had suggested that she join him in his business as means of coping with her disappointment. Though she''d done well at work, she soon began to focus solely on the business, leaving Harry feeling lonely for an emotional spousal connection.  His feelings of loneliness were most acute during the long stretches he spent away from her as he traveled.  On a particular day, while staying in a hotel in L.A., Harry met an interesting woman named Phyllis (Ida Lupino). They talked and spent time together but parted with Harry not expecting to see her again.
Talking on the phone with Eve that night, Harry tried to tell her everything about Phyllis and about his loneliness, but Eve was interested only in talking about business. Back home, he tried again, planning a vacation for the two of them; but she dismissed the idea, noting that she was pleased with the state of their marriage. On his next trip to L.A., Harry began seeing Phyllis again, platonically at first, but romantic feelings developed.  Not wanting to fall in love, Phyllis had not allowed Harry to share with her anything about his background and thus remained ignorant of his marriage.  On Harry''s last night in town, his birthday, they spent the night together.
Upon returning home, Harry was resolved to rededicate himself to his marriage, starting with planning to hire someone else to handle the L.A. business so that Harry would no longer have to be away from Eve.  He was overjoyed to find that this time Eve was fully receptive.  She acknowledged and apologized for having been so emotionally distant.  She embraced the idea of their adopting a child after having rejected it out of hand years before.  The single piece of bad news was that her father had taken ill and she needed to go spend time with her family in Florida.
Harry stayed close to home and began the adoption process. Three months later, with Eve still away, Harry had no choice but to return to L.A. to tend to the business interests there.  Once there, he found that Phyllis was pregnant.  She told Harry that she didn''t wish to trap him and that he was free to leave.  However, Harry had no interest in turning his back on the responsibility he felt to her and to their child.  He planned to call Eve, confess his infidelity, and ask for a divorce, but then came the news of her father''s death. Hearing how distraught she was, he couldn''t go through with his plan. But he couldn''t bring himself to leave Phyllis either and instead proposed to her.  With Eve pinning all of her hopes for happiness on becoming a mother, Harry had hoped to maintain his secret double lifelong enough for the adoption to be finalized and then divorce Eve, who would then at least still have her child.
Upon hearing the story, Jordan leaves without calling the police. Harry writes a farewell letter to the sleeping Phyllis and leaves the house. Eve returns to their home in San Francisco as Harry is about to meet the police who are waiting for him there. Harry ends up in court, where the two women finally meet. The judge notes that once Harry has served his sentence, he''ll be legally obligated to support both women.  And with regard to Harry''s personal life, "it won''t be a question of which woman he''ll go back to, but rather which woman will take him back."

Early scenes show the burning of the USS Merrimack by its Union crew to prevent it from falling into Confederate hands. However, the Merrimack, which had been burnt down to the waterline, was later rebuilt by the Confederacy, as an ironclad, and was renamed the CSS Virginia.
The film shows that, during the war, the Union built its own ironclad, the USS Monitor. When the Virginia emerged on its sortie in the Battle of Hampton Roads it inflicted major damage on the Union fleet in the harbor. Subsequent scenes show the arrival of the Monitor and its battle with the Virginia.
Scenes of the battle are dramatic and were done with models fabricated under the direction of Bud Thackery.','["Lew Ayres"]','["Bernard Schubert","Olive Cooper"]','["James Dunn","Mae Clarke","David Manners"]','[""]','5.5','["tt0032417","tt0165673","tt0043327","tt0026157","tt0031211","tt0064235","tt0025154","tt0024435","tt0023055","tt0036093","tt0054795","tt0027720"]','["drama"]','[{"url":"/hearts_in_bondage.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/hearts_in_bondage_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/hearts_in_bondage_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','hearts_in_bondage',51632,'Q3783971','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
('tt0033459','free','Cheers for Miss Bishop (1941)','1941','1h 35min','Miss Ella Bishop (Martha Scott) is a teacher at Midwestern University. The story is told in flashback and takes place over many years, from the 1880s to the 1930s, showing her from her freshman year to her retirement as an old woman. At the beginning, she lives with her mother and her vixenish cousin Amy (Mary Anderson); she remembers when her father had a farm near the town. Ella is an inhibited girl whose frustration grows as she approaches womanhood. She dreams of becoming a teacher. When she graduates from Midwestern University, she is thrilled when its president, Professor Corcoran (Edmund Gwenn), offers her a position on the faculty.
Ella becomes engaged to lawyer Delbert Thompson (Don Douglas), but Delbert is led astray by Amy and eventually has to marry her, despite loving Ella. The couple move away. After Amy becomes pregnant, Delbert abandons her. Amy dies in childbirth, leaving Ella to care for Amy''s daughter Hope (Marsha Hunt). Hope grows up and marries Richard (John Archer), and they move away and have a daughter named Gretchen (Lois Ranson). Ella also has a fling with another teacher, the unhappily married John Stevens (Sidney Blackmer), but John''s wife cannot give him a divorce for religious reasons, forcing Ella to break off the relationship. Later, she is distressed to learn that John has been killed.
Through all the years, Ella is supported by her friend Sam Peters (William Gargan), a local grocer who loves her. Another source of support is Professor Corcoran, who persuades her to stay when she considers leaving. His death is a blow to Ella. 
As Ella reaches old age, she reflects back and realizes she allowed the years to go by without achieving what she believes to be true fulfillment. When the new president pressures her to finally retire, she agrees. However, the years have not been without glory; and her moment of triumph arrives when her numerous, now-famous students from over the years return to a testimonial dinner at the school to honor their beloved Miss Bishop.','["Tay Garnett"]','["Bess Streeter Aldrich","Stephen Vincent Benet"]','["Martha Scott","William Gargan","Edmund Gwenn"]','["Drama","Romance"]','6.5','["tt0021770","tt0036094","tt0037614","tt0053003","tt0039566","tt0039645","tt0044789","tt0040427","tt0030910","tt0024210","tt0031602","tt0042700"]','["drama"]','[{"url":"/cheers_for_miss_bishop.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/cheers_for_miss_bishop_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/cheers_for_miss_bishop_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','cheers_for_miss_bishop',30367,'Q2961961','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

He attends her performance at a television variety show later that night. When the scheduled saxophonist is unable to perform, Bud steps in with a ballad that earns him a standing ovation.
Bud''s performance also earns the notice of talent scout Mike McCauley (Arch Hall Sr.), who offers him a record deal. Bud accepts the McCauley''s proposal. McCauley immediately installs Bud in a penthouse apartment, providing him with tailored suits, a Fender Jazzmaster, a mini tape recorder, and a new backing band ready to record his songs. Bud''s music career takes off in spite of his mounting doubts about the unscrupulous McCauley, who pays high school students to promote his music at their schools. Bud attempts to leave McCauley more than once, but relents when McCauley reminds him of the money he''s owed. Bud performs "Vickie" (also heard in the less contextually-appropriate Eegah) live on television, and Vickie sees the broadcast. She runs to the television studio where they joyfully reunite.

After a failed audition, where she is recognized as a burlesque performer from the Gaiety Theatre, her manager and fiancé Mike Hannegan suggest she writes an autobiography to project a more literate image and he hires Frederick Manly Gerard as a ghostwriter. Doll Face agrees on the condition she is allowed to dedicate the book to Mike with "For the love of Mike".
Another performer in the burlesque show, Chita Chula, remarks that if the book is a success and Doll Face leaves the show it will probably have to close down. Mike then decides to produce a Broadway show of his own with the financial aid of the performers themselves. Frederick offers to put up any money missing. Chita Chula (portrayed by Carmen Miranda) is skeptical she can pull it off, but Mike assures her she''ll "probably wound up being another Carmen Miranda!", something Chita Chula perceives as an insult.
Mike leaks word on the book to the press and, riding the publicity, argues the show got all the press it needs and that the book, although all but finished, needs not to be published. Doll Face, however, decides to go through with it and goes to Jamaica with Frederick for some final touch-ups. Boat engine trouble leaves them marooned on an island and, when Mike finds them, he misreads the situation and breaks up with her. Without "Doll Face" as headliner, the Gayety Theatre struggles and Mike is forced to finally shut it down.
Doll Face releases her book The Genius DeMilo and when Mike sees she dedicated the book to Frederick instead of him, he regrets leaving her. After Doll Face refuses to talk to Mike, he sends a lawyer to stop her show in the middle of opening night, since she is under contract not to appear in any show not produced by him. She agrees to see him and he asks her forgiveness.

He buys a plane ticket to Shanghai via Honolulu.
Cynthia Strong (Osa Massen, credited as Stephanie Paull) has just attended her husband''s funeral service. After the ceremony, she goes straight to the airport and buys a ticket.
As Cynthia leans back in her seat, she is caught by surprise when a man she knows named Alan Marker (Francis Lederer) comes up to her and claims he saw her murder her husband. Marker wants half the life insurance money to keep his mouth shut, but Cynthia denies that she killed her husband. Marker tells her she has until one hour after the plane lands in Honolulu to decide if she will give him the money.
Cynthia begs Nicholas, who is sitting close to her, for help, saying that the man she just talked to threatened her. Nicholas agrees to help, and pretends to be an acquaintance of Cynthia''s when Marker comes back.
Upon their arrival in Honolulu, it turns out they are all staying at the same hotel. Cynthia and Nicholas meet up again on the hotel terrace, while Marker sneaks into Nicholas'' room and steals his briefcase.
Cynthia and Nick talk about their respective attempts to flee from their lives. Soon, they are attracted to each other. Cynthia invites Nick to have dinner with her the next day. Nick has to catch his flight and must decline. When Nick returns to his room, he discovers someone has stolen his briefcase. He immediately suspects Cynthia and suspects she was working with Marker.
Cynthia denies the accusation and helps Nick search for Marker, who is missing from the hotel. They eventually track him to the airport and also board his flight, which is en route to San Francisco.
On the plane, Marker shows the other two that he has a gun and confesses to stealing the briefcase. As they arrive in San Francisco and prepare to de-plane, Marker sees to it that Nick is caught by the customs officers, who suspect he is carrying illegal plant life. During the commotion, Marker is able to leave the airplane before Nick and Cynthia.
Nick and Cynthia soon get out of the airport and start looking for Marker in the city''s hotels. Nick tells Cynthia about the money in his briefcase, and she tells him about the insurance money she got when her husband died. She suffered many years of abuse from her husband, and one evening after the two of them had dinner with Marker, her husband tried to rape her and when she pushed him away he accidentally fell off their terrace.
Cynthia reveals that Marker tried to blackmail and Nick believes every word she says. He claims to feel guilty about taking all his clients'' money. They decide to return to Los Angeles and try to set things straight. They agree that if they manage to do so, they''ll meet a month later in Honolulu.
As Nick is sitting in the restaurant alone, a young woman comes in to buy a bottle of a certain Napoleon brandy, which happens to be exactly the brand that is Marker''s favorite. Nick knows this, and tails the girl back to a boardinghouse, where he finds Marker. A fistfight ensues between Nick and Marker, but Nick wins and gets his briefcase back. He returns to Los Angeles.

He gets to the point, some twenty years earlier, when he had to devalue the currency. After secretly meeting the governor of the central bank and the minister of finance, he agreed to make the announcement one Monday. That morning, huge currency speculation broke out and Beaufort realised only one other person knew of the plan. This was Philippe Chalamont, the head of his private office, whose father-in-law was a banker. He made Chalamont write out and sign a confession, which he has kept ever since.
In his last term as prime minister, he was a passionate advocate of European union, seeing it as a healing of the hatreds which had torn the continent apart. His most persuasive opponent turned out to be Chalamont, by then in Parliament, who argued it would be bad for French business. In disgust at this petty-minded and sectional approach, Beaufort resigned and gave up politics. 
Chalamont has now been asked to form a government and Beaufort summons him to Evreux that evening. Before his enemy turns up, he removes the confession from its hiding place, puts it in his pocket and dozes off in front of the fire. He wakes up to find his secretary searching the room and, confronted, she admits she was bribed to find the incriminating document. Beaufort burns it and waits. When shown in, Chalamont opens with a spiel about relying in his new post on the advice of Beaufort, who he has always admired and trusted, and how he too now believes in European unity. Beaufort is not fooled, preferring France to have a new prime minister who is not a crook and a liar, so he threatens to divulge the currency incident to the media.

Brock (Julian Burton), a poet who performs at The Yellow Door cafe, the dimwitted, impressionable, busboy Walter Paisley (Dick Miller) returns home to attempt to create a sculpture of the face of the hostess Carla (Barboura Morris). He stops when he hears the meowing of Frankie, the cat owned by his inquisitive landlady, Mrs. Surchart (Myrtle Vail), who has somehow gotten himself stuck in Walter''s wall. Walter attempts to get Frankie out using a knife, but accidentally kills the cat when he sticks the knife into his wall. Instead of giving Frankie a proper burial, Walter covers the cat in clay, leaving the knife stuck in it.

The next morning, Walter shows the cat to Carla and his boss Leonard (Antony Carbone). Leonard dismisses the oddly morbid piece, but Carla is enthusiastic about the work and convinces Leonard to display it in the café. Walter receives praise from Will (John Brinkley) and the other beatniks in the café. An adoring fan, Naolia (Jhean Burton), gives him a vial of heroin to remember her by. Naively ignorant of its function, he takes it home and is followed by Lou Raby (Bert Convy), an undercover cop, who attempts to take him into custody for narcotics possession. In a blind panic, thinking Lou is about to shoot him, Walter hits him with the frying pan he is holding, killing Lou instantly.
Meanwhile, Walter''s boss discovers the secret behind Walter''s "Dead Cat" piece when he sees fur sticking out of it. The next morning, Walter tells the café-goers that he has a new piece, which he calls "Murdered Man". Both Leonard and Carla come with Walter as he unveils his latest work and are simultaneously amazed and appalled. Carla critiques it as "hideous and eloquent" and deserving of a public exhibition. Leonard is aghast at the idea, but realizes the potential for wealth if he plays his cards right.
The next night, Walter is treated like a king by almost everyone, except for a blonde model named Alice (Judy Bamber), who is widely disliked by her peers. Walter later follows her home and confronts her, explaining that he wants to pay her to model. At Walter''s apartment, Alice strips nude and poses in a chair, where Walter proceeds to strangle her with her scarf. Walter creates a statue of Alice which, once unveiled, so impresses Brock that he throws a party at the Yellow Door in Walter''s honor. Costumed as a carnival fool, Walter is wined and dined to excess.
After the party, Walter later stumbles towards his apartment. Still drunk, he beheads a factory worker with his own buzzsaw to create a bust. When he shows the head to Leonard, the boss realizes that he must stop Walter''s murderous rampage and promises Walter a show to offload his latest "sculptures". At the exhibit, Walter proposes to Carla, but she rejects him. Walter is distraught and now offers to sculpt her, and she happily agrees to after the reception. Back at the exhibit, however, she finds part of the clay on one figure has worn away, revealing Alice''s finger. When she tells Walter that there is a body in one of the sculptures, he tells her that he "made them immortal", and that he can make her immortal, too. She flees, he chases, and the others at the exhibit learn Walter''s secret and join the chase. Walter and Carla wind up at a lumber yard where Walter, haunted by the voices of Lou and Alice, stops chasing Carla, and runs home. With discovery and retribution closing in on him, Walter vows to "hide where they''ll never find me". The police, Carla, Leonard, Maxwell, and the others break down Walter''s apartment door only to find that Walter has hanged himself. Looking askance at the hanging, clay-daubed corpse, Maxwell proclaims, "I suppose he would have called it "Hanging Man" ... his greatest work."','["Roger Corman"]',NULL,'["Dick Miller","Barboura Morris","Antony Carbone"]','["Comedy","Crime","Horror"]','6.7','["tt0054033","tt0149973","tt0112594","tt0058606","tt0023238","tt0055304","tt0057693","tt0056368","tt0226018","tt0093133","tt0053925","tt0054462"]','["cult film","Roger Corman","Beatniks","Third Eye Cinema"]','[{"url":"/ABucketofBlood_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/Bucket_1959.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/Bucket_1959_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','ABucketofBlood',248728,'Q2567687','wp','["Charles B.

Red turns down Billy initially, but after seeing a photo of his father, "Cannonball" Coy, a famous driver, Red scares up a job for Billy.  Billy''s father died in an accident at the Indianapolis 500 several years previously.  Red was Cannonball''s mechanic, riding with him the day he died in the north turn of the Indianapolis motor speedway. Red inquires after "her"; he still carries a torch for Mary (Spring Byington), Cannonball''s widow and Billy''s mother.
At the garage, Billy befriends a tomboy, Louise Riley (Mary Hatcher), whose father owns the nearest racetrack. Billy gets a chance to prove his skills as a driver in a qualifying race, but he is too arrogant to follow his employer''s advice and is unsuccessful. He asks Louise to meet on Saturday night at the track.  Thinking it is a date, Louise does the unheard of for her -- she buys a dress and heels (in which she is unskilled at walking), assisted by her family''s maid (Hattie McDaniel).  As it turns out, Billy needed her help with changing some carburetors, much to Louise''s disappointment.  She gamely wobbles on high heels with him to the garage, buoyed by her love of cars and affection for Billy.
Billy gets another chance to drive for another car owner, Deacon Jones. The car is green and referred to as a "Hoodoo Wagon" due to a racing superstition that green cars are unlucky.  A helpful gadfly in the pits reminds Billy this is the same color as the car his father drove when he crashed and burned. Billy drives but is pushed off the track by driver Vic Sullivan (Michael O''Shea). Billy survives the crash but fails to qualify. He vents his frustration at the dirty trick by punching Vic.  Distracted by the spectacle, another driver injures his hand by absentmindedly placing it on the searing exhaust pipe of his car in which he''s sitting; Billy is offered the opportunity to drive in the incapacitated man''s stead.
Billy wins the next race and continues driving for Jones.  Together with his team''s other driver, Happy Lee (Steve Brodie), they make headlines with their success.  Billy gets arrested for speeding after he has too much to drink. Red bails him out, and contrary to Red''s advice, Billy goes on to race that same night.
When the left rear wheel in Happy''s car breaks, Billy tries desperately to catch up to Happy and alert him but instead crashes into Happy''s car after the wheel comes off. The car skids to a stop in Billy''s path.  Happy''s car is smashed through the wall, rupturing the gas tank and the car bursts into flames.  Despite Billy''s frantic efforts to save him, Happy dies in the blaze. After the race, the other drivers avoid Billy, convinced Billy made good his tyro promise to "...drive over them" and he is fired from Jones''s garage. Billy decides to move "back east, where the big cars and the big money are."
Billy stays in contact with Louise, and starts fresh as a race car driver. In his absence, his mother and Red get married.
On the day of the next Indianapolis 500 race, Mary, Red and Louise turn out to support Billy.  He drives one of Red''s cars and leads, but on the final lap Billy drives through flaming gasoline from a wreck which causes Billy''s engine to catch fire.   Battling the smoke, Billy finishes the race, taking third place, leaping from the car just before it explodes.  Billy is bitterly disappointed not to have won, especially since without a winning purse Red can''t afford to race again.

He calmly walks out of his bedroom, through the dining room, and into the kitchen.  He gets a single cup of water, returns to the bedroom, and throws it on the fire.  He repeats this several times; meanwhile, he drinks some of the water, flirts with the maid in the kitchen, and stops to eat an apple in the dining room.  Mrs Rough and her mother discover the fire and insist on more effective methods, so Rough obtains a garden hose from a gardener (Keaton).  After initially squirting everything but the fire, Rough finally succeeds in putting it out.
A delivery boy (also Keaton) arrives.  He and the cook (St John) get into a fight over the affections of the maid and chase each other all over the house until Rough throws them out.  A passing policeman arrests them and takes them to the police station, where the officer in charge gives them a choice:  join the force or go to jail. 
The Roughs are expecting dinner guests.  Lacking the cook, Rough must prepare the dinner.  Some of his techniques are creative (e.g., slicing potatoes by putting them through a fan), but others prove disastrous (e.g., serving soup with a sponge).  When he finds he is out of rum, he pours gasoline on the steak instead.  He brings it to the table and sets fire to it, which completely spoils the dinner and embarrasses his wife and mother-in-law.
The two dinner guests appear to be distinguished, but actually they are thieves in disguise.  In the chaos, they sneak away and steal one of Mrs Rough''s necklaces.  
Luckily, a plain clothes officer has been tailing them.  He telephones the station; the former delivery boy and cook respond.  They run to the house, falling down slopes and, in the delivery boy''s case, getting stuck on a fence.  Meanwhile, the plain clothes officer and Rough, both armed and firing wildly, chase the thieves around the house.

Quasimodo is a deaf, half-blind, hunchbacked bell-ringer of the famous Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris. His master is a man named Jehan, the evil brother of Notre Dame''s saintly archdeacon Dom Claude. One night, Jehan prevails upon Quasimodo to kidnap the fair Esmeralda, a dancing gypsy girl (and the adopted daughter of Clopin, the king of the oppressed beggars of Paris'' underworld). The dashing Captain Phoebus rescues Esmeralda from Quasimodo, while Jehan abandons him and flees (later in the film, Quasimodo hates Jehan for abandoning him and is no longer loyal to him). At first seeking a casual romance, Phoebus becomes entranced by Esmeralda, and takes her under his wing. Quasimodo is sentenced to be lashed in the public square before Esmeralda and Dom Claude come to his aid.

To their dismay, Jehan and Clopin learn that Phoebus hopes to marry Esmeralda, despite being engaged to Fleur de Lys. Phoebus persuades Esmeralda to accompany him to a ball celebrating his appointment as Captain of the Guard by King Louis XI. He provides her with rich garments and introduces her to their hostess, Madame de Gondelaurier, as a Princess of Egypt. Clopin, accompanied by his beggars, crashes the festivities and demands Esmeralda be returned. To avoid bloodshed, Esmeralda says that she does not belong with the aristocracy. Later, however, Esmeralda sends the street poet Pierre Gringoire to give Phoebus a note, arranging a rendezvous at Notre Dame to say goodbye to him. Phoebus arrives and is stabbed in the back by Jehan. After Esmeralda is falsely sentenced to death for the crime, she is rescued from the gallows by Quasimodo and carried inside the cathedral, where he and Dom Claude grant her sanctuary.
Later that night, Clopin leads the whole of the underworld to storm the cathedral, and Jehan attempts to take Esmeralda, first by guile (telling her that Phoebus''s dying wish was for him to take care of her), then by force. Quasimodo holds off the invaders with rocks and torrents of molten lead. Meanwhile, the healed Phoebus is alerted by Gringoire and leads his men against the rabble. When Quasimodo finds Jehan attacking Esmeralda, he throws his former master off the ramparts of Notre Dame, but not before Jehan fatally stabs him three times in the back. Phoebus finds and embraces Esmeralda. Witnessing this, Quasimodo rings his own death toll, and Gringoire and Dom Claude enter the bell tower just in time to see him die. The last image is of the great bell swinging silently above Quasimodo''s corpse.','["Wallace Worsley"]','["Victor Hugo","Perley Poore Sheehan"]','["Lon Chaney","Patsy Ruth Miller","Norman Kerry"]','["Drama","Horror","Romance"]','7.3','["tt0031455","tt0016220","tt0011130","tt0017739","tt0050781","tt0014972","tt0019130","tt0016473","tt0018528","tt0011237","tt0011565","tt0027194"]','["silent; Lon Chaney; Quasimodo;"]','[{"url":"/The_Hunchback_of_Notre_Dame_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/The_Hunchback_of_Notre_Dame_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','The_Hunchback_of_Notre_Dame',87836,'Q288425','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Tonart Studios manager Joseph Steiner (Lugosi) is assigned to handle the situation. The studio wants to pass it off as a simple accident, but screenwriter Franklyn Drew (Manners) digs a bullet out of a wall and tells Homicide Detective Lieutenant Sheehan that it is a .38 caliber, while the guns used in the film are all .45s.
Sheehan finds a letter in the dead man''s pocket, in which Brent wrote to his lawyer that Marcia Lane (Ames), his co-star and ex-wife, would not sign a release as beneficiary of his $200,000 life insurance policy. Chalmers, an alcoholic extra with a self-admitted grudge against Brent for getting him fired as head gaffer (electrician), is spotted trying to dispose of a loaded .38, but Drew points out that the gun has not been fired.
Drew suggests they view the footage of the fatal scene for clues, but somebody knocks out the projectionist and burns the print using a cigarette with rouge on it. It is a special rouge normally used by only two women. One was away on location, making Lane the prime suspect. Before another print can be made, the negative is destroyed with acid.
While snooping around on the set, Drew finds a derringer mounted inside a lamp and electrically wired to be fired remotely, but he is knocked out and the gun taken. He goes to question Chalmers, but finds him dead beside a glass of poison and a written confession. However, Drew finds several clues that make him suspicious. Through more detective work, he discovers that the new battery of Lane''s car is dry, and battery fluid is poisonous. Meanwhile, Goldsmith comes to see Lane; she rejects his advances once again.
In Brent''s dressing room, Drew finds a letter from a love-stricken married woman named "Agnes" and a hotel room key. Later, in Steiner''s office, Sheehan takes Lane into custody; Drew spots a photo of a woman on the desk; the inscription reveals that Steiner''s wife is named Agnes. When Drew goes to the hotel, he finds out from a bellhop that Brent had been there with a woman; her husband was waiting, and the two men got into a fight.
The studio decides to finish the film (only the last, fatal scene needs to be shot), using a double for Brent and arranging for Lane''s temporary release. Drew finds out from the prop man that the guns were originally supposed to be .38s, but he made an unauthorized substitution. Drew takes him to Sheehan. Just as he is about to reveal who ordered the guns, the lights go out. (The murderer had overheard the conversation through a studio microphone.) After a gunfight and chase, the killer falls to his death. It is Avery, the director.','["Edwin L.

('tt0025586','free','Of Human Bondage (1934)','1934','1h 23min','Sensitive, club-footed artist Philip Carey (Leslie Howard) is a Briton who has been studying painting in Paris for four years. His art teacher tells him his work lacks talent, so he returns to London to become a medical doctor, but his moodiness and chronic self-doubt make it difficult for him to keep up in his studies.
Philip falls passionately in love with vulgar tearoom waitress Mildred Rogers (Bette Davis), even though she is disdainful of his club foot and his obvious interest in her. Although he is attracted to the anemic and pale-faced woman, she is manipulative and cruel toward him when he asks her out. Her constant response to his romantic invitations is "I don''t mind", an expression so disinterested that it infuriates him – which only causes her to use it all the more. His daydreams about her (her image appears over an illustration in his medical school anatomy textbook, and a skeleton in the classroom is transformed into Mildred) distract him from his medical examination, and he fails.
When Philip proposes to her, Mildred declines, telling him she will be marrying Emile Miller (Alan Hale), a bombastic salesman, instead. The self-centered Mildred berates Philip with vindictive  insults for continuing to be romantically interested in her.
Philip begins to forget Mildred when he falls in love with Norah (Kay Johnson), an attractive and considerate romance writer working under a male pseudonym. She slowly cures him of his painful addiction to Mildred. But just when it appears that Philip is finding happiness, Mildred returns, pregnant and claiming that Miller has abandoned her. When Philip goes to Miller and demands that he do right by Mildred, Miller says he has no responsibility for an unwed mother. He never married Mildred and cannot now: He already has a wife and daughter.
Philip provides a flat for Mildred, arranges to take care of her financially, and breaks off his relationship with Norah. Norah and Philip talk about the way relationships may amount to bondage (Philip was bound to Mildred, as Norah was to Philip, and as Mildred was to Miller). Philip''s intention is to marry Mildred after her child is born. He is disappointed when a  bored and restless Mildred turns out to have no interest in  motherhood and gives up the baby''s care to a nurse.

At a dinner party celebrating their engagement, one of Philip''s medical student friends, Harry Griffiths (Reginald Denny), flirts with Mildred, who reciprocates. After Philip confronts Mildred, she runs off to Paris with Griffiths. For a second time, Philip finds some comfort in his studies, and with Sally Athelny (Frances Dee), the tender-hearted daughter of Thorpe Athelny (Reginald Owens), one of his elderly patients in a charity hospital. The Athelny family is caring and affectionate, and they take Philip into their home.
Once again, Mildred returns with her baby, this time expressing remorse for deserting him. Philip cannot resist rescuing her and helping her to recover from another failed relationship. Things take a turn for the worse when Mildred moves in. Philip rejects her attempt to seduce him, telling her that she can stay in the apartment as long as she needs to, but she disgusts him. Furious, she rages at him, saying that it made her sick to kiss him: Afterwards, she would wipe her mouth. Shrieking “you gimpy-legged monster, you’re a cripple, a cripple, a cripple!” she runs into the bedroom and slams the door shut. The next morning, after Philip has gone out, she spitefully wrecks his apartment, destroys his paintings and books, and burns the securities and bonds he was given by an uncle to finance his tuition. 
Philip is forced to quit medical school, but before he leaves, one of his teachers offers to try to correct his club foot. The operation is a success. The Athelnys take Philip in when he is unable to find work and is locked out of his flat, and he takes a job with Sally''s father as a window dresser. Sally is clearly in love with him, but he doesn’t see it. Philip receives a letter from his medical school friend Dunsford ( Reginald Sheffield), sent on behalf of Mildred, who saw Philip in the store window. Her baby has died, and she is now sick, destitute, and - the movie suggests - working as a prostitute. Philip diagnoses her cough as tuberculosis. She tries to make up to him, but he calmly writes a list of things that she will need and leaves.
Philip receives a letter informing him that his uncle has died, leaving a small inheritance of £300. ( Equivalent to approximately $26,800 in 2018)  With the money, Philip is able to return to medical school and pass his examinations to become a qualified doctor. He gets a job with a steamship line, and is appointed ship’s physician on a vessel bound for Sydney, Australia. 
The day before he leaves, he is touched to learn that Sally loves him, and asks her to marry him when he returns, if she feels the same. “Don’t you mean, if you feel the same?” she asks wistfully, and Philip does not reply.
Mildred’s landlady calls for an ambulance to take the unconscious woman away, and as Griffiths himself says, the “ irony of fate” is that he is the doctor in charge. At the hospital, Philip comes to Mildred’s room, having heard that it is an interesting case. Griffiths tells him there is nothing he can do and when Philip persists, commands him not to go in. Griffiths tears up the admitting card and tosses it to the floor. Philip sees Mildred’s name on it. He walks away, stunned.
The next day, Sally meets Philip at the steamship office. He tells her he isn’t sailing, tears up a wad of travel brochures on the South Seas and puts them in her hand “as a wedding present for my wife.” She is afraid that this is “a noble gesture.” They walk slowly through a crosswalk, oblivious to the persistent cabbie following them and to the cacophony of horns from stopped traffic that drowns out their conversation. The next words we hear are from her: “ Philip, you’re free.” She asks why he doesn’t sail, and he replies, “Everything that is beautiful to me is right here.” She consents and the cabbie’s persistence pays off: They jump into the taxi and kiss.','["John Cromwell"]','["Lester Cohen","W.

('tt0036423','free','Nazty Nuisance (1943)','1943','50min','Germany''s Führer Adolf Hitler embarks on a secret journey to the oriental country of Norom to negotiate a treaty with the blood-thirsty High Chief Paj Mub, mostly because Paj Mub insists on meeting Hitler personally instead of making relations through Hitler''s emissary, Kapitän von Popoff. Unfortunately, despite Hitler''s insistence that they shouldn''t be told and Goebbels'' efforts to mislead them, his Axis partners Benito Mussolini of Italy and General Suki Yaki of Japan unsolicitedly appear at the submarine dock and invite themselves to the trip.
However, at the same time an American supply ship has just been sunk by a German U-boat, although the crew under their skipper, Captain Spense, escape in a lifeboat. They incidentally land on Norom, where they discover the High Chief''s camp, and as Seaman Benson does some reconnaissance, he meets Kela, the young female assistant to an alcoholic magician, who tells him that her master was hired by Paj Mub for an exclusive performance in honor of Hitler''s upcoming reception. Benson spontaneously hits upon the plan to impersonate the magician and sneaks into the camp, where Kela instructs him in the use of the magician''s props. At the same time, Spense and the rest of his men witness Hitler arriving and disembarking at the island (although they do not recognize him from the distance), and decide to investigate.
Forewarned by Popoff not to displease the High Chief (lest they would surely not only lose the chance to this contract, but perhaps also their heads), Hitler and his partners meet Paj Mub, who invites them to dinner before he will sign the treaty. However, Benson does his best to ruin the meeting: first, by spiking the served soup with pepper (this results in Hitler and Suki Yaki finding it unpalatable, while Mussolini thinks it bland), then switching the guests'' wine with kerosene. Benson as the magician is then brought in and demonstrates the magic trunk illusion, switching Kela for himself. The Paj Mub likes it and insists that one of the three Axis partners go into the box next. Hitler refuses on the grounds that he likes his appearance, and Mussolini begs off due to his girth, so Suki Yaki goes into the trunk. There, he accidentally gets knocked unconscious by Kela, who is trying to fend off an orang-utan who discovered the tunnel under the trunk. Because of this, the ape takes Kela''s intended place in the trick, greatly amusing the Paj Mub. He agrees to sign the contract, but as "Suki Yaki" is supposed to sign before the High Chief, the ape squirts Hitler and Mussolini with ink, prompting Paj Mub to consider signing the treaty the next morning and sticking the ape in the same tent as his foreign guests for the night.
As the festivities take place, Spense and his men capture the submarine which brought the Axis leaders to Norom. While investigating the High Chief''s camp soon afterwards, Spense runs into Benson, who reveals to him the presence of the three most important Axis leaders on this island. Carrying on his plan, Benson wakes Suki Yaki from his unconsciousness and, with the general''s help, manages to convince Hitler and Mussolini that Paj Mub intends to betray them. After making it back to the submarine, Hitler demonstrates his gratitude to Benson by punching him off the vessel, but he is surreptitiously pulled out of the water by his crewmates, who keep themselves hidden from the Axis leaders as they enter the boat for the return journey.
As the submarine is underway, the radio operator receives a message that an Allied refugee ship was torpedoed and its passengers massacred, lifting Hitler''s mood. Enraged, Benson attempts to teach Hitler a hard lesson, but Spense prevents him from doing so, citing the Geneva Convention''s clause of prisoner of war treatment. Benson relents from employing force, but then locks Hitler''s cabin door and falsely announces through the intercom that the submarine is sinking, sending the Axis leaders into hysterics for a while, before he cheerfully reveals the Americans'' presence on the boat.
However, Popoff has in the meantime gone mad from Hitler''s promise of getting shot for his supposed failure with Paj Mub. He smashes the sub''s navigation instruments when he is left unattended, leaving the sailors blind in the sea. The sub runs aground, nose in the air, at the shore of a tropical island. Thinking that the sub is trapped underwater, the desperate Axis leaders decide to have themselves shot to the surface via the torpedo tubes. The film ends with Benson and Spense beholding Hitler, Suki Yaki and Mussolini being stuck headfirst in the island beach''s sands, with their feet treading empty air.','["Glenn Tryon"]','["Earle Snell","Clarence Marks"]','["Bobby Watson","Joe Devlin","Johnny Arthur"]','["Action","Adventure","Comedy","Fantasy","War"]','4.6','["tt0053453","tt0028358","tt0035770","tt0038733","tt0031102","tt0034651","tt0045216","tt0038478","tt0036921","tt0034857","tt0058622","tt0022807"]',NULL,'[{"url":"/the_last_three.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/the_last_three_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/the_last_three_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','the_last_three',16970,'Q6983561','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
('tt0140578','free','Stukas (1941)','1941','1h 41min','The plot largely alternates between combat and lulls in combat, with the exception of two narratives. In one, three of the flyers who have been shot down behind enemy lines make their way back to the German position, finally succeeding after one of them manages to talk a French unit into capitulating. In the other, a shell-shocked flyer whose doctor has prescribed "a profound experience" recovers the will to fight when he hears "Siegfried''s Rhine Journey" during a performance of Wagner''s Götterdämmerung at the Bayreuth Festival. (He has a flashback to his commander and the chief medical officer playing the same passage four-handed on the piano.) The film ends with them in flight on their way to attack England.

Stukas is an example of the Nazi contemporary film, or Zeitfilm, a type which Ritter, the scriptwriter and director, largely invented and championed as an answer to Russian revolutionary films. The film was commissioned by the Luftwaffe and presents participation in war as a joy. As a contemporary critic wrote, "Sheer enthusiasm transfigures the danger.... For [the dashing leader of the Bull''s Squadron], ... fight is like intoxication, while for the squadron''s captain of the ''cavaliers,'' ... it is the elixir of life; for the captain of the Ninth, ... it is spirit, distance, concentration." Howard K. Smith wrote more disapprovingly in Last Train from Berlin: "It was a ... film about a bunch of obstreperous adolescents who dive-bombed things and people. They bombed everything and everybody. That was all the whole film was". The film emphasises "comradeship and self sacrifice"; we are shown the young pilots learning to deal with comrades'' deaths for the greater good. As one character says to another, "[A man] doesn''t really think about his comrades'' death any more, only about what they died for". Like other Nazi war films, it makes heavy use of song; in a famous scene at the end, the squadron leader informs his pilots of their new mission against England and its dangers, we then see them seated in their aircraft, and the camera zooms in on their faces and then cuts to the clouds as they begin "ecstatic[ally]" to sing the "Stukaslied":
The squadron members represent a range of types and backgrounds, from various different parts of the Reich, shown united; additionally, in the flying scenes the pilots'' faces are photographed with a metallic greyish cast to suggest how they have become one with their aeroplanes.','["Karl Ritter"]','["Felix Lützkendorf","Karl Ritter"]','["Carl Raddatz","Hannes Stelzer","Ernst von Klipstein"]','[""]','5.6','["tt9415552","tt0036782","tt0034765","tt0033973","tt0025913","tt0032653","tt0033702"]','["Stuka"]','[{"url":"/1941-Stukas1h31m512x384CzUntertitel_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/1941-Stukas_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','1941-Stukas',23938,'Q1228723','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

As they speed across a bridge, their car plunges into the river. The police spend hours dredging the murky, fast-running water without success. Mary miraculously surfaces, but she cannot remember how she survived.
Mary moves to Salt Lake City, Utah, where she has been hired as a church organist. While driving through the desert, Mary''s radio picks up strange organ music and she has visions of a ghoulish, pasty-faced figure (simply called "The Man" in dialogue). She glimpses a large, abandoned pavilion on the shores of the Great Salt Lake, which seems to beckon to her in the twilight. A gas station attendant tells her the pavilion was first a bathhouse, then a dance hall, and finally a carnival before it closed.
In town, Mary rents a room. John, the only other lodger, wants to become better acquainted.  The blonde newcomer though is not interested. That night, she becomes upset when she sees The Man downstairs and retreats to her room. Soon, Mary begins experiencing terrifying interludes when she becomes invisible and inaudible to the rest of the world, as if she simply is not there. When The Man appears briefly in front of her in a park, she flees, right into the arms of a Dr. Samuels. He tries to help her, acknowledging he is not a psychiatrist.
Mary''s new employer, the minister (Art Ellison), is put off when she declines a reception to meet the congregation. When she practices for the first time, she finds herself shifting from a hymn to eerie music. In a trance, she sees The Man and other ghouls dancing at the pavilion. The minister, hearing the strange music, denounces it as sacrilege and insists upon her resignation. Terrified of being alone, Mary agrees to go out with John. When they return home, he smooth-talks his way into her room.  When she sees The Man in the mirror, she tells John what has been happening to her. He leaves, believing she is losing her mind.
After going back to Samuels'' office, Mary believes she has to go to the pavilion. However, Mary is confronted by The Man and his fellow ghouls. She tries frantically to escape, boarding a bus to leave town, only to find that all the passengers are ghouls. 
It is just a nightmare; she awakes in her car. In the end, she is drawn back to the pavilion, where she finds her tormentors dancing, a pale version of herself paired with The Man. When she runs away, the ghouls chase her onto the beach. She collapses as they close in.
The following day, Samuels, the minister, and police go to the pavilion to look for Mary. They find her footprints in the sand and they end abruptly. Back in Kansas, her car is pulled from the river.

However, it has already been let to annoyingly inquisitive Charles Dimble (Alastair Sim). To compound the confusion, Mrs. Barrington had also agreed to allow it to be converted into a military hospital. Spitfire pilot Flight Lieutenant Perry (John Mills) parachutes into the nearby loch and becomes the first patient, tended by Mrs. Barrington''s pretty daughter Helen (Carla Lehmann). Mrs. Barrington moves Ronald to the main house, while Dimble and Perry remain in the cottage.
Ronald makes friends with Mrs. Barrington''s husband John (Leslie Banks), a brilliant but eccentric inventor, currently working on a bombsight for the Royal Air Force. However, he insists on working on his own. His assistant, Alan Trently (Michael Wilding), becomes jealous when Helen starts spending too much time with Perry. Eventually though, Helen lets Trently know that she prefers him.
Meanwhile, the government grows concerned about Barrington''s security; his last invention, a self-sealing fuel tank, was copied by the Germans within a month of its mass production. Trently comes under suspicion, as he had been educated in Germany.
It turns out that there is cause for concern; German agents kidnap Barrington. Ronald stows away in the car used to take the captive to an isolated water mill. When Perry shows up, Ronald attacks one of the spies to help in the "rescue". Unfortunately, it is all in vain, as Perry is revealed to be the ringleader. Perry intends to take Barrington to Berlin on a seaplane which is due to arrive the next night.
However, Dimble turns out to be a British counterintelligence officer. He manages to infiltrate the ring and learn where Barrington is being held.

Inspired by a nurse at the hospital he finds himself trapped in, he insists on living his last days in grand fashion and sneaks out of the hospital with the help of this nurse. On the way, he catches a ride from a good-looking young woman who catches his fancy. After riding in her car for a bit, she leaves him by the side of the road. Unfazed and fascinated by her remarkably blue eyes, he follows her to Peaceful Bay, where he comes across the house of an old beekeeper who is in critically poor health.
While Jamie seeks medical attention for the man, the Beekeeper instructs him to take care of his bees while he''s away at the hospital, assuring him that his partner in beekeeping will come by soon to help. After the Beekeeper is taken away, his partner introduces himself as 10-year old "Little Scout," an enthusiastic young child with lots of knowledge of the keeping and maintenance of bees. He teaches Jamie the ways of the ranch and introduced him to his friends, who enjoy acting as a mock military battalion. He also meets his neighbor Ms. Campbell, a charming mother figure who takes care of him and treats him as she would a son. It is revealed in a separate scene that she has been missing her daughter for several months and that her daughter is the woman Jamie had gotten a ride from earlier.
That night, while on a walk, Jamie runs into this woman, crying to herself. After imploring her to tell him what''s wrong, she admits that she needs to become legally married to someone for some undisclosed reason. Realizing that he''s falling in love with her, he agrees to marry her if only legally. Despite his best efforts, she refuses to tell him her name. The next day, they are married at the courthouse, where Jamie learns that the mystery woman''s name is "Louise". The woman immediately leaves Jamie and he returns to his bees, disappointed.
A series of rapid events quickly shakes his world: First, the old Beekeeper falls ill and dies, surprisingly leaving half of his possessions to Jamie and the other half to Little Scout, including the bees and their surrounding property. Little Scout admits to Jamie that she is actually a girl trying to blend in with the neighborhood boys, which leads him to encourage her to do what she wants as herself and not under a guise. Finally, Jamie receives a call telling him that his "wife" has just given birth and is ill.
He rushes to the hospital and finds a woman he''s never met in the hospital bed, apologizing for never explaining to him the situation before dying. He returns to the house with a baby and a renewed confusion about the situation. Soon, the young woman to whom he is married arrives and reveals to him the whole story: that she is actually Molly Campbell (the niece of Ms. Campbell) and Louise is her cousin, the one who died in the hospital giving birth. Molly needed a marriage certificate, which she obtained by getting married to Jamie as Louise, in order to save her cousin from others shaming her for having a baby outside of marriage. She wanted to keep this news from her mother to save her from the grief.

The Nazis eagerly await the arrival of an American convoy with information about an Allied attack. When a military plane flies overhead, the Nazis shoot it down. The commander sends the warriors to search for survivors.
At the wreck site, the mortally wounded Lieutenant hands his secret documents to the crew''s only survivor, Lois Lane. He tells her to destroy the documents. Then he dies. Lois is caught by the natives and tied up, but frees herself, runs into the jungle and avoids capture long enough to hide the documents under a rock. She is then captured and brought back to the temple for interrogation where she is tied to a chair. When she refuses to talk, the commander orders the warriors to burn her at the stake.
Meanwhile, Clark Kent and another pilot are flying out to meet with Lois'' convoy. They spot the wrecked plane not far from the aboriginal village. Clark parachutes down to investigate. Once on the ground, he changes into Superman. He flies to the village. Lois is already being burned at the stake with the commander watching her. Just then, one of the warriors approaches the commander and gives him a set of papers. It''s the documents Lois hid in the woods.

He is then driven into Nuremberg, through equally enthusiastic people, to his hotel where a night rally is later held.
Day 2: The second day begins with images of Nuremberg at dawn, accompanied by an extract from the Act III Prelude (Wach Auf!) of Richard Wagner''s Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg. Following this is a montage of the attendees preparing for the opening of the Reich Party Congress, and footage of the top Nazi officials arriving at the Luitpold Arena. The film then cuts to the opening ceremony, where Rudolf Hess announces the start of the Congress. The camera then introduces much of the Nazi hierarchy and covers their opening speeches, including Joseph Goebbels, Alfred Rosenberg, Hans Frank, Fritz Todt, Robert Ley and Julius Streicher. Then the film cuts to an outdoor rally for the Reichsarbeitsdienst (Labor Service), which is primarily a series of quasi-military drills by men carrying spades. This is also where Hitler gives his first speech on the merits of the Labour Service and praising them for their work in rebuilding Germany. The day then ends with a torchlight SA parade in which Viktor Lutze speaks to the crowds.
Day 3: The third day starts with a Hitler Youth rally on the parade ground. Again the camera covers the Nazi dignitaries arriving and the introduction of Hitler by Baldur von Schirach. Hitler then addresses the Youth, describing in militaristic terms how they must harden themselves and prepare for sacrifice. Everyone present, including General Werner von Blomberg, then assemble for a military pass and review, featuring Wehrmacht cavalry and various armored vehicles. That night Hitler delivers another speech to low-ranking party officials by torchlight, commemorating the first year since the Nazis took power and declaring that the party and state are one entity.
Day 4: The fourth day is the climax of the film, where the most memorable of the imagery is presented. Hitler, flanked by Heinrich Himmler and Viktor Lutze, walks through a long wide expanse with over 150,000 SA and SS troops standing at attention, to lay a wreath at a First World War memorial. Hitler then reviews the parading SA and SS men, following which Hitler and Lutze deliver a speech where they discuss the Night of the Long Knives purge of the SA several months prior. Lutze reaffirms the SA''s loyalty to the regime, and Hitler absolves the SA of any crimes committed by Ernst Röhm. New party flags are consecrated by letting them touch the Blutfahne (the same cloth flag said to have been carried by the fallen Nazis during the Beer Hall Putsch) and, following a final parade in front of the Nuremberg Frauenkirche, Hitler delivers his closing speech. In it he reaffirms the primacy of the Nazi Party in Germany, declaring, "All loyal Germans will become National Socialists. Only the best National Socialists are party comrades!" Hess then leads the assembled crowd in a final Sieg Heil salute for Hitler, marking the close of the party congress. The entire crowd sings the Horst-Wessel-Lied as the camera focuses on the giant Swastika banner, which fades into a line of silhouetted men in Nazi party uniforms, marching in formation as the lyrics "Comrades shot by the Red Front and the Reactionaries march in spirit together in our columns" are sung.','["Leni Riefenstahl"]','["Leni Riefenstahl","Walter Ruttmann"]','["Adolf Hitler","Hermann Göring","Max Amann"]','["Documentary","History","War"]','7.3','["tt0156078","tt0027073","tt0030523","tt0024127","tt0032653","tt0024087","tt0248379","tt0156524","tt4532404","tt4661358","tt0030522","tt6238614"]','["Reichsparteitag"]','[{"url":"/1935-Triumph-des-Willens-Das-Dokument-vom-Reichsparteitag-1934_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/1935-TriumphDesWillens-DasDokumentVomReichsparteitag19341h44m720x576_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','1935-Triumph-des-Willens-Das-Dokument-vom-Reichsparteitag-1934',7665,'Q156497','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

('tt0020530','free','Un chien andalou (1929)','1929','16min','The film opens with a title card reading "Once upon a time". A middle-aged man (Luis Buñuel) sharpens his razor at his balcony door and tests the razor on his thumb. He then opens the door, and idly fingers the razor while gazing at the moon, about to be engulfed by a thin cloud, from his balcony. There is a cut to a close-up of a young woman (Simone Mareuil) being held by the man. She calmly stares straight ahead as he brings the razor near her eye. Another cut occurs to the moon being overcome by the cloud, then a cut to a close up of a hand slitting the eye of an animal with the razor (which happens so quickly the viewer may believe it was the woman''s eye), and the vitreous humour spills out from it.
The subsequent title card reads "eight years later". A slim young man (Pierre Batcheff) bicycles down a calm urban street wearing what appears to be a nun''s habit and a striped box with a strap around his neck. A cut occurs to the young woman from the first scene, who has been reading in a sparingly furnished upstairs apartment. She hears the young man approaching on his bicycle and casts aside the book she was reading (revealing a reproduction of Vermeer''s The Lacemaker). She goes to the window and sees the young man lying on the curb, his bicycle on the ground. She emerges from the building and attempts to revive the young man.
Later, the young woman assembles pieces of the young man''s clothing on a bed in the upstairs room, and concentrates upon the clothing. The young man appears near the door. The young man and the young woman stare at his hand, which has a hole in the palm from which ants emerge. A slow transition occurs focusing on the armpit hair of the young woman as she lies on the beach and a sea urchin at a sandy location. There is a cut to an androgynous young woman, with bobbed hair and dressed in rather masculine attire, in the street below the apartment.  She pokes at a severed human hand with her cane while surrounded by a large crowd held back by policemen.
The crowd clears when the policeman places the hand in the box previously carried by the young man and gives it to the young woman. The androgynous young woman contemplates something happily while standing in the middle of the now busy street clutching the box. She is then run over by a car and a few bystanders gather around her. The young man and the young woman watch these events unfold from the apartment window. The young man seems to take sadistic pleasure in the androgynous young woman''s danger and subsequent death, and as he gestures at the shocked young woman in the room with him, he leers at her and grasps her breasts.
The young woman resists him at first, but then allows him to touch her as he imagines her nude from the front and the rear. The young woman pushes him away as he drifts off and she attempts to escape by running to the other side of the room. The young man corners her as she reaches for a racquet in self-defense, but he suddenly picks up two ropes and drags two grand pianos containing dead and rotting donkeys, stone tablets containing the Ten Commandments, two pumpkins, and two rather bewildered priests (played by Jaime Miravilles and Salvador Dalí) who are attached by the ropes. As he is unable to pursue, the young woman escapes the room. The young man chases after her, but she traps his hand, which is infested with ants, in the door. She finds the young man in the next room, dressed in his nun''s garb in the bed.
The subsequent title card reads "around three in the morning". The young man is roused from his rest by the sound of a door-buzzer ringing (represented visually by a Martini shaker being shaken by a set of arms through two holes in a wall). The young woman goes to answer the door and does not return. Another young man, whom we see only from behind, dressed in lighter clothing, arrives in the apartment, gesturing angrily at him. The second young man forces the first one to throw away his nun''s clothing and then makes him stand with his face to the wall, as if in disgrace.
The subsequent title card reads "Sixteen years ago".  We see the second young man''s face for the first time (and discover that he is also played by Pierre Batcheff) as he admires the art supplies and books on the table near the wall and forces the first young man to hold two of the books as he stares at the wall. The first young man eventually shoots the second young man when the books abruptly turn into pistols. The second young man, now in a meadow, dies while swiping at the back of a nude female figure which suddenly disappears into thin air. A group of men come and carry his corpse away.
The young woman returns to the apartment and sees a death''s-head moth. The first young man sneers at her as she retreats and wipes his mouth off his face with his hand. The young woman very nervously applies some lipstick in response. Subsequently, the first young man makes the young woman''s armpit hair attach itself to where his mouth would be on his face through gestures. The young woman looks at the first young man with disgust, and leaves the apartment sticking her tongue out at him.
As she exits her apartment, the street is replaced by a coastal beach, where the young woman meets a third man with whom she walks arm in arm. He shows her the time on his watch and they walk near the rocks, where they find the remnants of the first young man''s nun''s clothing and the box. They seem to walk away clutching each other happily and make romantic gestures in a long tracking shot. However, the film abruptly cuts to the final shot with a title card reading "In Spring", showing the couple buried in beach sand up to their elbows, motionless and perhaps dead.','["Luis Buñuel"]','["Salvador Dalí","Luis Buñuel"]','["Pierre Batcheff","Simone Mareuil","Luis Buñuel"]','[""]','7.7','["tt0021577","tt0000417","tt0015648","tt0000439","tt0010323","tt0068361","tt0036154","tt0019760","tt0023037","tt0042804","tt0000012","tt0061395"]','["Luis Bunuel; Salvador Dali; Dali; Bunuel"]','[{"url":"/Luis_Bu_uel_Un_Chien_Andalou_Un_perro_andaluz_1929.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/UnChienAndalou_313_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','UnChienAndalou_313',99693,'Q190575','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

They are remanded to Wilton Reform School, where Muggs, the wise-cracking leader of the gang, is dubbed "Mr. Wise Guy" by the brutal guard Jed Miller (Dick Ryan).
Jim Barnes (Jack Mulhall), the new warden, reassures Danny''s older brother Bill (Douglas Fowley), who has bad memories of the school from when he served as a guard there, that his testimony describing the place''s cruelty eventually resulted in the dismissal of the former warden and the adoption of gentler rules. Bill is given a tour of the school by Barnes''s secretary, Ann Mitchell (Joan Barclay), and later takes her out to dinner.
That night, while Bill buys cigarettes in a drugstore, escaped convict Luke Manning (Guinn Williams) robs the place and murders the clerk. Manning takes Bill hostage in his car and forces him to lead the police on a chase. Manning escapes when Bill crashes the car, and Bill is later convicted of robbery and murder and sentenced to execution.
In the reform school, the boys have been battling with two toughs, "Rice Pudding" Charlie(Gabriel Dell) and Chalky Jones (Bobby Stone), but when Barnes witnesses Miller encouraging a fistfight, he demands Miller''s resignation. Chalky tries to get the kids in trouble by informing Barnes of their plans to run away, but in an effort to establish a code of honor, Barnes punishes Chalky for being an informer.
When Muggs and his pals see newsreel footage of a man and woman accepting the winnings from a lottery, they recognize the man as Knobby (Billy Gilbert), the driver of the stolen truck. They link Knobby to Manning based on information given to them by Charlie, who is Manning''s nephew. Armed with information that could prove Bill''s innocence, the boys escape from the reform school and go to the apartment of Dorothy Melton (Ann Doran), the woman from the newsreel. The kids hold the pair, who had been planning to leave town with the lottery money which actually belongs to Manning, who was afraid of being seen. Manning appears at Dorothy''s apartment to demand his money and hits Dorothy for double-crossing him with Knobby. Before the situation can worsen, the police arrive and arrest the criminals. Bill gets a reprieve from the governor, and Ann and the boys see him off as he reports for active military duty.','["William Nigh"]','["Martin Mooney","Sam Robins"]','["Leo Gorcey","Bobby Jordan","Huntz Hall"]','[""]','6.1','["tt0033144","tt0032277","tt0037074","tt0035345","tt0034420","tt0033428","tt0034064","tt0033613","tt0034224","tt0036073","tt0035741","tt0034973"]','["Bowery Boys; East Side Kids; Comedy"]','[{"url":"/mr_wise_guy.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/mr_wise_guy_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/mr_wise_guy_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','mr_wise_guy',23030,'Q12126323','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Danny Turner (Lon McCallister) arrives in the area to move into his mother''s birthplace now owned by his stepfather Tom Eggars (Preston Foster). Tom is constantly threatened by a hostile neighbor, Gil Hawkes (Forrest Tucker). Shortly after Danny arrives Tom and Gil have a scuffle, a sure sign of a soon-to-be war. When Danny arrives he meets Doris Cooper (Peggy Ann Garner), whom he develops a crush on. After some close calls with Gil, the drought and the cougar become such big issues that the mayor of a nearby town announces that a hunt be started for the big cat. The hunt is unsuccessful, with the Eggars'' dog chasing the cougar back to its lair and the party left behind. Tom tells Danny that he may have to move away and live with the Hawkes family due to the troubles he is having around the farm.
The next day he goes to the hill to show Gil and his family that he will come live with them. Gil''s son Jim (Skip Homeier) teases Danny about his failure to kill the cougar and their dislike of Tom. Danny then refuses to live with them because he remembers Gil is the one who mistreated his mother and refused to let her marry Tom. Tom hears this and attacks Gil, and the two fight. Danny and Jim also get into a fight when the angered Jim accuses Danny of starting the fight. Danny and Tom win both fights and Tom tells Gil that Danny will continue living with him.
The next morning Tom takes Danny hunting, but due to his dislike of killing animals Danny refuses to take a shot at a deer. Understanding this, Tom takes the gun and shoots the deer himself. However, the cougar hears the noise and follows them to Tom''s cabin. While Tom and Danny are in the shed, preparing to cut up the deer, the cougar enters the farm and nibbles at the carcass. Tom fires at the cougar and pursues it into the woods. Meanwhile, Danny goes back into the woods to retrieve a gun he left there. Tom chases the cougar, firing at it, but the cougar then surprises him by attacking from above. The cougar kills Tom and runs off into the wilderness.
Grieved at Tom''s death, Doris pleads for Danny not to go after the dangerous cougar, but the vengeful Danny vows to do so. With his dog, Danny leaves in search of the cougar. He and his dog have an eventful chase with the cat before they corner it inside a small cave. Unable to see in the dark, Danny and his dog are at a disadvantage and are attacked by the cougar. In the ensuing battle, Danny''s dog is almost killed, but Danny is able to kill the cougar. Later Danny and Doris celebrate the cat''s defeat. With the cat gone, Gil and Jim will no longer be a threat to Danny and Doris, now possible lovers.','["Phil Karlson"]','["Morton Grant","Dorothy Yost"]','["Lon McCallister","Peggy Ann Garner","Preston Foster"]','["Action","Adventure","Drama","Romance","Western"]','5.4','["tt0041796","tt0074315","tt0042278","tt0051755","tt0044859","tt0039902","tt0036926","tt0031709","tt0025954","tt0030491","tt0031710","tt0044789"]','["Drama"]','[{"url":"/The_Big_Cat.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/The_Big_Cat_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/The_Big_Cat_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','The_Big_Cat',46231,'Q325651','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The timeline covers approximately 2,500 years.

The ancient "Babylonian" story (539 BC) depicts the conflict between Prince Belshazzar of Babylon and Cyrus the Great of Persia. The fall of Babylon is a result of intolerance arising from a conflict between devotees of two rival Babylonian gods—Bel-Marduk and Ishtar.
The Biblical "Judean" story (c. AD 27) recounts how—after the Wedding at Cana and the Woman Taken in Adultery—intolerance led to the Crucifixion of Jesus. This sequence is the shortest of the four.
The Renaissance "French" story (1572) tells of the religious intolerance that led to the St. Bartholomew''s Day Massacre of Protestant Huguenots fomented by Catholic royals.
The American "Modern" story (c. 1914) demonstrates how crime, moral puritanism, and conflicts between ruthless capitalists and striking workers help ruin the lives of marginal Americans. To get more money for his spinster sister''s charities, a mill owner orders a 10% pay cut to his workers'' wages. An ensuing workers'' strike is crushed and The Boy and The Dear One make their way to another city; she lives in poverty and he turns to crime. After they marry, he tries to break free of crime but is framed for theft by his ex-boss. While he is in prison, his wife must endure their child being taken away by the same "moral uplift society" that instigated the strike. Upon his release from prison, he discovers his ex-boss attempting to rape his wife. A struggle begins and in the confusion the girlfriend of the boss shoots and kills the boss. She escapes and The Boy is convicted and sentenced to the gallows. A kindly policeman helps The Dear One find the real killer and together they try to reach the Governor in time so her reformed husband will not be hanged.Breaks between the differing time periods are marked by the symbolic image of a mother rocking a cradle, representing the passing of generations. The film simultaneously cross-cuts back and forth and interweaves the segments over great gaps of space and time, with over 50 transitions between the segments. One of the unusual characteristics of the film is that many of the characters do not have names. Griffith wished them to be emblematic of human types. Thus, the central female character in the modern story is called The Dear One. Her young husband is called The Boy, and the leader of the local Mafia is called The Musketeer of the Slums. Critics and film theorists maintain that these names reveal Griffith''s sentimentalism, which was already hinted at in The Birth of a Nation, with names such as The Little Colonel.','["D.W.

The next morning Coe is found dead, locked inside his bedroom. District Attorney Markham (Robert McWade) and Police Sergeant Heath (Eugene Pallette) assume it was suicide, because Coe was shot through the head and was found holding a pistol. Vance is not convinced. He soon finds evidence that Coe was murdered. Coroner Dr. Doremus (Etienne Girardot) determines the victim had bled to death internally from a stab wound. 
There is no shortage of suspects; Coe was very much disliked. His niece Hilda Lake (Mary Astor) resented her uncle''s tight control of her finances and jealousy of any men who showed interest in her. Her boyfriend, Sir Thomas MacDonald (Paul Cavanagh), suspected Coe of killing his dog to ensure winning the competition. Raymond Wrede (Ralph Morgan), the dead man''s secretary, was in love with Miss Lake, but had been laughed at when he sought Coe''s support. Coe''s next-door neighbor and lover Doris Delafield (Helen Vinson) had been cheating on him with Eduardo Grassi (Jack La Rue). When Coe found out, he cancelled a contract to sell his collection of Chinese artworks to the Milan museum for which Grassi worked. Liang (James Lee), the cook, had worked long, hard, and illegally to help Coe amass his collection. He warned his employer against the proposed sale and was fired as a result. Even Coe''s own brother Brisbane (Frank Conroy) despised Coe. Finally, Gamble (Arthur Hohl), the head servant, had concealed his criminal past.
Brisbane Coe becomes Vance''s prime suspect. His alibi of taking a train at the time of the murder is disproved. When Brisbane is found dead in a closet, Vance is both puzzled and enlightened. Among Brisbane''s effects, Vance finds a book titled Unsolved Murders; a bookmarked page details a method of using string to lock a door through the keyhole without leaving a trace. Part of the mystery is solved.
Later, an attempt is made on the life of Sir Thomas using the same dagger used to kill Coe. Finally, a Doberman Pinscher belonging to Miss Delafield is found seriously injured, apparently struck with a fireside poker. From these and other clues, Vance finally solves the crime. 
It turns out that two men sought Coe''s life that night. The successful murderer struggled with Coe and stabbed him, leaving him for dead. Coe awakened soon after. Too dazed to recall the fight or realize that he was mortally wounded, he went upstairs to his bedroom and opened his window before dying. Brisbane entered the chamber; seeing his brother apparently asleep in his chair, he shot the corpse and arranged the scene to look like a suicide. Downstairs, he ran into the actual killer, who had seen through a window that Archer Coe was still alive and come back to finish the job. In the darkness, the killer mistook Brisbane for Archer and killed the wrong man. Delafield''s dog then wandered in, attracted by the commotion, and attacked the murderer.
While sure of the killer''s identity, Vance has no proof. He therefore arranges for Sir Thomas and Wrede to quarrel over Hilda Lake. When Wrede instinctively reaches for the poker to strike his rival, the Doberman recognizes its attacker and leaps on him. Wrede confesses he became enraged when Coe refused to assist his courtship of Miss Lake, precipitating the stabbing.','["Michael Curtiz"]','["S.S. Van Dine","Robert N.

('tt0053726','free','1-2-3-4 ou Les collants noirs (1961)','1961','2h 20min','The four independent stories are performed in the form of ballet, interspersed with introductions by Maurice Chevalier. In two of them (Cyrano de Bergerac and Carmen), he periodically explains events as the story progresses.
La Croqueuse de diamants translates as "The Gold Digger", or more literally as "the diamond cruncher". (Twice during the story, the title character swallows a diamond, with a crunching sound.) The story, a romantic comedy, opens in Les Halles. Amid the hubbub of street activity, a group of woman street vendors sing in French about their trade. A furniture delivery man (Dirk Sanders), while delivering a seating bankette to a cafe, encounters a woman pickpocket (Zizi Jeanmaire, The Gold Digger), who is the leader of a pickpocketing gang, based next door to the cafe. The delivery man and the gold digger fall in love with each other, the latter leaving her criminal gang to go off with her new love.
Cyrano de Bergerac is a tragic romantic story, based on a play of the same name. Both Cyrano de Bergerac (Roland Petit) and Christian de Neuvillette (Georges Reich) love Roxanne (Moira Shearer). But the poet Cyrano has a big nose and is too shy to declare his love to Roxanne. Instead, he helps his friend Christian woo Roxanne, writing love letters on his behalf.
Deuil en 24 heures translates as "mourning in 24 hours" or more loosely as A Merry Mourning. (A shop appearing in the film shows "Deuil en 24 heures" as the shop name.) Along the Champs-Élysées, a wealthy man (Hans von Manen) accompanies his wife (Cyd Charisse) on a shopping trip to buy a dress. A strange man (Roland Petit) flirts with his wife in a cafe. The husband challenges the flirting man to a duel which the husband fatally loses. The wife starts to enjoy her widowhood. The story is a black comedy.
Carmen is the tragic story of the soldier Don José (Roland Petit) falling in love with the Gypsy Carmen (Zizi Jeanmaire). The plot of the ballet roughly follows the story of the opera with some variations in plot detail. The ballet features music by Georges Bizet. In the Lillas Pastia scene, the ballet troupe sings l''amour est enfant de bohème in a half-sung/half-spoken fashion.','["Terence Young"]','["Roland Petit","Edmond Rostand"]','["Maurice Chevalier","Les Ballets de Paris","Zizi Jeanmaire"]','["Drama","Musical"]','6.2','["tt0055774","tt0056267","tt0054652","tt0054692","tt0048338","tt0093496","tt0070140","tt0046374","tt0055264","tt0053365","tt0059108","tt0085755"]','["Drama; Musical; Ballet; Zizi Jeanmaire"]','[{"url":"/BlackTights.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/BlackTights_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/BlackTights_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','BlackTights',8963,'Q4922044','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

('tt0065858','free','How Awful About Allan (1970)','1970','1h 30min','Allan Colleigh is suffering from psychosomatic blindness following a fire that killed his father, a renowned academic who punished Allan as a child. The fire also facially scarred Allan''s sister Katherine. Allan had accidentally left some cans of paint thinner near a heater which caught fire.
Returning home partially cured after months in a mental hospital, Allan tries to adjust to his life back at home. Katherine has an ex-boyfriend who has gone away, but who phones the house after Allan''s return. She also takes in an odd boarder who she says has a throat injury and hence can only speak in a whisper. Allan is suspicious and afraid of the new boarder and when he begins to hear his name being whispered and partially sees a dark figure coming to get him, wonders whether he is crazy or whether someone is really out to get him. He records his suspicions on a reel-to-reel tape recorder in his bedroom.
Olive, Allan''s fiancée before his father died in the fire, tries to renew contact with Allan. He is, at first, reluctant but gradually is persuaded to see her again. He asks her to keep an eye out for the mysterious lodger so she can describe the lodger to him. Olive persuades him to take a trip into town in her car. While she drops books back at the university library, she leaves Allan alone in the car and he thinks he hears the whispering again. He tries to drive the car away, only to crash it.
After further incidents with the blurry, whispering figure – and Allan cutting himself with a knife upon being startled by a delivery boy at the kitchen window – Katherine tries to persuade him to see the psychiatrist again. Meanwhile, Olive claims to have seen Katherine''s boyfriend in the town. Katherine denies that he has returned, but Allan feels she is hiding something and suspects she wants to have him sent back to the hospital. Allan experiences various nightmares. In one he relives his punishment by his father, during which he hid in a dark cupboard. In another episode, the whispering voice lures him to a room which seems burnt and where the ceiling timbers fall in. The next morning, he is convinced that the room was real. This belief is reinforced by his finding a piece of burnt wood in the house.
Allan calls the hospital, hoping to see the psychiatrist. Unfortunately, the doctor is away. Allan will have to take a cab to meet the doctor on his return. The cab duly arrives, but in going to meet it, Allan slips on the path. The cab driver turns out to be Eric, Katherine''s boyfriend, who has a croaky whispering voice which he attributes to a cold. Olive, who has come looking for him, helps Allan back into the house. Later, after ensuring Alan is still alive although his door is locked, Olive and Katherine speak together and Olive says she will send Allan back to the hospital the next morning, as she cannot stand it any more. Allan had tried to convince Olive there was a plot against him, remembering that the whispering voice was on his tape recorder from the night before, but she is no longer in the room when the voice plays back. Allan smashes the tape recorder on the floor.
Soon after, the whispering voice lures Allan into the kitchen pantry and the door is locked behind him. He finds that a fire has been set within, but douses it with some flour and manages to break the door down and wrestle with the shadowy attacker. As he pulls the figure''s black mask off, his vision returns and he recognizes his sister, Katherine. He also removes the plastic "appliance" which she had adhered to her face to represent her scar. She confesses that she had the scar from the fire removed, but says that it should have remained there as a brand to show all the world Allan''s crime: the "murder" of their father, "the greatest man who ever lived".
After some time has passed, Allan comes home and talks to Olive, who is preparing dinner for them. He has been taking a music appreciation course and seems much more normal. However, he has received a letter from Katherine – who was evidently sent to a psychiatric facility – pleading with him to have her released. As he contemplates this, his vision goes dark – he is blind again.','["Curtis Harrington"]','["Henry Farrell","Henry Farrell"]','["Anthony Perkins","Julie Harris","Joan Hackett"]','["Thriller"]','5.9','["tt0069994","tt0083976","tt0076644","tt0070270","tt0067828","tt0074829","tt0065594","tt0089274","tt0098193","tt0103242","tt0132451","tt0065595"]','["Drama; Horror; Mystery; Thriller; Anthony Perkins"]','[{"url":"/HowAwfulAboutAllan.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/HowAwfulAboutAllan_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/HowAwfulAboutAllan_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','HowAwfulAboutAllan',105218,'Q5917423','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Will Hansen (Chuck Connors), Ike (Aron Kincaid), Hank (Henry Caps), Jeb (Smokey Robards), and Billy (Peter Ford) have just emigrated from their home state of Texas to Colombia in South America. After their arrival, they are ambushed by Colombian soldiers who force them to come meet General Martinez, the evil, cold-hearted dictator of their country. Martinez sends them to San Carlos, a town where rebel forces are preparing to start a civil war against Martinez''s army.  The Texans are instructed to live among the rebels, and report back to Martinez what they know within the next couple of days.  Martinez warns them that they''ll be severely punished if they fail him.
The next day, while on their way to San Carlos, Will''s gang runs into a gypsy family who are on their way to the same town. Will escorts them after he and the gypsies'' daughter, Mila, fall in love at first sight. They all ride into San Carlos, meet the governor, and rent a cabin outside of town. Will and Mila sneak out that night and make love.  Mila''s father is angry when he hears of this, and slices her cheek. When Will finds out about this, he shoots Mila''s father.
Being from famously rebellious Texas, Will''s gang finds itself in sympathy with the San Carlos rebels. Will and his gang disobey Martinez''s orders and don''t report back to him, so Martinez kidnaps Will and hangs him. Will''s friends find his body, give him a funeral, and vow to avenge his murder. They join the rebels in a battle with Martinez''s army and drive them back. They later ambush Martinez and the rest of his surviving soldiers in a canyon, joined by the rebel army''s captain. They manage to kill Martinez, but all are gunned down by his soldiers except for Billy, who was unconscious after falling from his horse.

Don Morse (Robert Preston), an All-American football player at Harvard, enlists to avoid being engaged to two women simultaneously, told that army privates are not allowed to marry. Jeff Hollis (Buddy Ebsen) is a hillbilly cajoled into enlisting by the daughter of a feuding family.  
They meet on the train to Fort Benning, Georgia, for training as parachute infantry. Don and Bill''s attempts to become better acquainted with pretty fellow passenger Kit Richards (Nancy Kelly) annoy her father, Bill "Old Thunderhead" Richards (Harry Carey), until they reveal that they are Army recruits.
In camp, they are surprised to discover that Richards is a master sergeant newly assigned to their unit as chief instructor and a pioneer of the concept. Richards reports to the commandant, his old friend and Bill''s father. Bill was named after Richards and they agree to keep Bill''s identity a secret from the rest of the company to avoid favoritism.  Bill accepts a blind date and finds out it is Kit. When Don tries to date her, Richards encourages Bill to "stick around as long as you like."  
Bill confesses his fear of parachuting to Kit.  When the recruits make their first practice jump, a nervous trainee loses his nerve, pulls a pistol, and demands that the aircraft land. Bill talks him into giving him the gun. Impressed by Bill''s nerve, Richards reveals to the company that he is the commandant''s son, but Bill confesses his fear and applies for a transfer to another branch. Richards helps him overcome his fear of jumping and Bill saves his life in the process.
Bill''s romantic rivalry with Don comes to a head when Don gets word that he is to receive an officer''s commission and decides to ask Kit to marry him.

To keep them out of trouble, Tex arranges for a small observation aircraft to take them up. However, when Don jumps, his parachute becomes tangled with the tail of the aircraft. Bill crawls back and cuts the tangled shroud lines as Don hangs on to him.

Consulting the ancient 800-year-old Martian sage Chochem (a Yiddish/Hebrew word meaning "sage", though pronounced differently from the film''s version), they are advised that the children of Mars are growing distracted due to the society''s overly rigid structure. From infancy, all their education is fed into their brains through machines and they are not allowed individuality or freedom of thought.
Chochem notes that he had seen this coming "for centuries", and says that the only way to help the children is to allow them their freedom and be allowed to have fun. To do this, Mars needs a Santa Claus figure, like on Earth. Leaving Chochem''s cave, the Martian leaders decide to abduct Santa Claus from Earth and bring him to Mars.
The Martians cannot distinguish between all the fake Santas, so they kidnap two children to find the real one. Once this is accomplished, one Martian, Voldar, who strongly disagrees with the idea, repeatedly tries to kill Santa Claus along with the two kidnapped Earth children. He believes that Santa is corrupting the children of Mars and turning them away from Mars'' original glory.
When they arrive on Mars, Santa and the children build a factory to make toys for the Martian children. However, Voldar and his assistants, Stobo and Shim, sabotage the factory and change its programming so that it makes the toys incorrectly. Meanwhile, Dropo, Kimar''s assistant, who has taken a great liking to Santa Claus and Christmas, puts on one of Santa''s spare suits and starts acting like Santa Claus. He goes to the toy factory to make toys, but Voldar mistakes him for Santa and kidnaps him.
When Santa and the children come back to the factory to make more toys, they discover that someone has tampered with the machines. Voldar and Stobo come back to the factory to make a deal with Kimar, but when they see the real Santa Claus, they realize that their plan has been foiled. Dropo, held hostage in a cave, tricks his guard Shim and escapes. Kimar then arrests Voldar, Stobo, and Shim. Santa notices that Dropo acts like him, and says that Dropo would make a good Martian Santa Claus.

They experience problems mid-air when they are caught in a tropical storm, and all the ships in the South Sea area are alerted to their distress.
Virginia''s brother, Lt. George Allerton (Grant Richards), is stationed with the U.S. Marine Corps on the nearby island of Palo Pango when he hears his sister''s distress calls. Virginia and Max head to the island to take refuge from the storm.
Upon their arrival, Virginia and Max are welcomed by two U.S. Marines: "Stripes" Thornton (William Gargan) and "Milly" Barnes (Wallace Ford). Also present is Oliver Barton (Gilbert Roland), who runs the trading post but is also in the business of smuggling guns. He invites Virginia to stay at his house for the night, and also challenges her to a flying race to Guam, betting $5,000 that he will win. Both Marines are soon smitten by Virginia, and she becomes attracted to Stripes.
Virginia is unaware that Barton is planning to use her as cover for his shipment of guns about to take place on the steamer Albotros, commanded by Captain N. Lawson (Harry Woods). To help him, Barton has an assistant, "Doc" Spriggs (Etienne Girardot), an old eccentric gentleman who believes in reincarnation.
The race begins and Barton tries to outrun Virginia by taking a perilous shortcut over an island. Barton plays a trick on Virginia by faking his aircraft crashing into the jungle. Virginia lands on the water to rescue him but damages her aircraft in the process. It turns out Barton lives nearby and Virginia and Max are invited to be the guests of him and his Caribbean wife Inda (Katherine DeMille).
Inda believes that Barton is smitten and becomes jealous of Virginia. Max finds evidence in Barton''s aircraft of his gun smuggling operation, and a fight between the men ensues. Inda kills Max with a poisoned dart she fires from a blowgun. Barton flees the island and goes back to Palo Pango. He lies to Stripes, telling him he has no idea where Virginia is, but Stripes finds a poisoned dart stuck into the hull of the aircraft and becomes suspicious. He deploys Milly and they follow Barton.
Stripes hides aboard Barton''s aircraft and manages to tell the others where they land. He finds Virginia in Barton''s jungle home, but Inda alerts Barton and Stripes and Virginia are quickly surrounded. Still, Stripes manages to hold Barton captive. The group escape boarding Barton''s aircraft but it will not start. Barton runs off in the midst of a shoot-out, Milly arrives, armed with his hand grenades, and joins in to help Stripes.
Barton captures Virginia and brings her with him in his escape, but Inda spots the two of them, and furious with jealousy, gives the order to have him shot. A ship of Marines arrive on the scene and save the day, helping them back to Palo Pango.

('tt0033675','free','The Great Commandment (1939)','1939','1h 18min','The film takes place in 30 A.D. Judea in a fictional village near Jerusalem. The protagonist is Joel, the elder son of the village rabbi Lamech. Lamech wants Joel to follow in his footsteps as a scribe and rabbi, but Joel is secretly a zealot leader, believing that more must be done to help his nation than studying the Scriptures. He is also secretly in love with Tamar, the daughter of the carpet merchant Jemuel, and he overhears his father and Jemuel arranging a marriage between Tamar and one of Lamech''s sons. Unfortunately for Joel it turns out to be his younger brother Zadok, an impetuous zealot, whom Joel has to protect from his own recklessness. A crisis is brought about by the arrival of a troop of soldiers led by a centurion, Longinus, who issues the demand for a special tax to be collected by a tax collector traveling with them. Zadok and other zealots organize the release of prisoners taken by the soldiers, which moves Longinus to plan a massacre of the men of the village. Zadok wants to attack the Romans right away, but Joel feels that a larger resistance is needed through someone reputed to be the coming Messiah of the Jewish people, Jesus Christ. Joel runs afoul of his father in declaring his love for Tamar, whom his father wants wedded to Zadok, and in revealing that he is a zealot leader.
With the sword of the zealots entrusted to him, Joel goes out to find Jesus in order to enlist His leadership of their cause. [Jesus is not presented directly in this film, but only as a reflection in water, as the glow of light on His listeners, and by way of the voice of Irving Pichel, the director.] Joel meets Jesus'' disciples, Andrew and Judas Iscariot, who have two different ideas about Jesus'' mission. Judas, like the zealots, thinks that Jesus should be a military and political leader who would lead his people against the Romans. Joel confronts Jesus with the sword of the zealots, and Jesus declines his invitation with the words of Matthew 26:52 "all who take up the sword will perish by the sword."
Joel disappointedly returns to his village just in time for the wedding feast of his brother Zadok and his beloved Tamar. He comes up with the idea that he and the zealots would kidnap Jesus and force His hand to support them. This is forestalled by Jesus'' appearance at the village gate where Joel''s father is presented as the scribe who asks Jesus, "What is the greatest commandment in the Law? (Luke 10:25-37). Jesus replies with His Parable of the Good Samaritan. Jesus'' exhortation at the end to, "Go and do thou likewise", moves Joel to abandon his plan to kidnap Jesus.
Zadok is told by Nathan the innkeeper that Longinus is vulnerably asleep at his inn, and he gives up going to his bridal bed in order to kill Longinus. Nathan calls Joel and Lamech to the inn because Longinus repulsed Zadok''s attack by killing him. The effect of Jesus'' words on Joel moves him to keep from killing the unconscious Longinus and standing as a buffer between him and the men of the village, who are thirsting for his blood. When they ask Joel why he is protecting Longinus, he replies that he too is his brother.
Longinus sends word for his soldiers to meet him at the inn, and he has the soldiers arrest Joel and take him to prison in Jerusalem. In prison Joel misses the Passion of Jesus. Tamar is allowed to visit him. They are met by Longinus, who tells Joel that he had him arrested for his own protection from the village mob. He tells him of another wonder: he was a witness of Jesus'' crucifixion, and he was the soldier who thrust the spear in His side to make sure He was dead. Longinus throws down the spear, and he, Joel, and Tamar return to the village to witness their Christian faith.','["Irving Pichel"]','["Dana Burnet","Dana Burnet"]','["John Beal","Maurice Moscovitch","Albert Dekker"]','[""]','6.5','["tt0014532","tt0023470","tt0018054","tt0046051","tt0047494","tt0033582","tt0044943","tt0046942","tt4211312","tt0049833"]','["Drama;Religious"]','[{"url":"/great_commandment.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/great_commandment_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','great_commandment',49374,'Q25136214','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Shortly before the wedding,  Tom''s old girlfriend Vi Mason (Juli Reding) visits and informs him that she will end his relationship with Meg, using blackmail if necessary. While she is arguing with him atop a lighthouse, the railing she is leaning on gives way. She manages to hang on briefly, but Tom refuses to help and watches her fall to her death.
The next day, Tom sees Vi''s body floating in the water. After he retrieves her, the body turns into seaweed. He tries to forget what he has seen, but over the next few days, Vi''s watch washes up on the beach, strange footprints appear in the sand, Vi''s ghost appears and tells Tom that she will haunt him for the rest of his life, and when Meg''s little sister Sandy (Susan Gordon) asks to see the wedding ring Tom will give Meg, a disembodied hand makes off with it.
Soon afterward, during a party for Tom and Meg, Vi''s disembodied head appears in a photo a guest takes of the couple. Later, when Tom''s alone, Vi taunts him that she will now use her voice to tell the world how Tom Stewart killed her.
To add to Tom''s dilemma, a ferry-driving beatnik comes looking for Tom, intent on collecting the $5.00 Vi owes him for her trip to the island. Tom''s haste to pay the fellow off causes the shifty man to stick around, and his attempts to blackmail Tom lead to his death. Unbeknownst to Tom, Sandy has inadvertently witnessed the murder.
Sandy keeps quiet about what she has seen. At the wedding she almost speaks up at the point in the ceremony where the minister asks if anyone objects to the marriage, but before she can speak, the church''s front doors burst open and the flowers all to wilt as the candles die out, bringing the ceremony to an abrupt, unpleasant halt.
Later that night, Tom goes to the lighthouse and tells Vi that he is leaving the island. When he finds Sandy listening in, he realizes that he is trapped: Sandy knows too much and could possibly tell Meg and the others. Desperately Tom leads Sandy up to the broken lighthouse railing with the intent to push her over, but Vi''s ghost swoops down on him, causing him to go over the edge as Sandy watches.
When the islanders search for Tom''s body, the first one they find is Vi''s. Shortly afterward, Tom''s body is found and placed next to Vi''s body, which somehow manages to turn and lay its arm across his body. On Vi''s dead hand is the engagement ring that was supposed to be Meg''s, signaling that Tom is now stuck forever with Vi.','["Bert I. Gordon"]','["Bert I.

('tt0037074','free','Million Dollar Kid (1944)','1944','1h 5min','In the East Side Kids'' clubhouse, Muggs McGinnis (Leo Gorcey) laments the epidemic of mugging that has been plaguing their streets. While waiting outside a store that afternoon, the boys witness a man being attacked in the alley and come to his defense, chasing away his assailants. In gratitude, the man, millionaire John Cortland (Herbert Heyes), hands Muggs his business card. When the cynical Muggs tosses the card in a garbage can, Glimpy McClosky (Huntz Hall) digs it out and finds the man''s cash-laden wallet in the trash.
After the boys deliver the wallet to Capt. Mathews (Noah Berry, Sr.) of the police department, the captain mistakes them for the thieves and arrests them. Cortland soon arrives at the police station to claim his wallet, however, and identifies the boys as his rescuers. Upon discovering that the boys long for a gymnasium, Cortland invites them to his house the next day. There, Cortland shows them his son John Jr.''s basement gymnasium, and after explaining that John is overseas fighting, he offers the boys the use of the facilities.
Escorting the boys upstairs, Cortland introduces them to his pretty daughter Louise (Louie Currie) and his son Roy (Johnny Duncan), whose hand has been sprained. Noting Roy''s injured hand, Muggs begins to suspect that he was involved in the robbery, but when Capt. Mathews asks for a description of the thieves, Muggs refuses to cooperate. Soon after, Louise''s fiancé, French soldier Lt. Andre Dupree (Stanley Brown), arrives, and Louise informs her father that all the servants have quit, thus jeopardizing a dinner party she had planned for that evening. Attracted to Louise, Muggs suggests that his mother (Mary Gordon) and Mrs. McClosky (Patsy Moran) would be happy to cook and serve for the party.
When Muggs overhears Andre drop his French accent during a phone conversation, he begins to suspect that he is a phony and decides to follow him. Muggs and Glimpy trail Andre to the Zig Zag Club, where he meets his paramour, showgirl Maizie Dunbar (Iris Adrian). Deciding to tell Louise the truth about her fiancé, Muggs and Glimpy return to the Cortland mansion, but Louise refuses to believe their story. Meanwhile, the other boys are walking past the neighborhood pool hall when they see Roy playing pool with two of the robbers. When Muggs returns to the clubhouse, the boys tell him about spotting Roy at the pool hall.
Later that night, Muggs takes Maizie to the Cortland party, and when she sees Andre flirting with Louise, she jealously confronts him. After overhearing their heated conversation, Louise finally realizes that Andre is a gigolo and asks him to leave. Later, the doorbell rings, and when Muggs answers it, he is handed a telegram, notifying the Cortlands of John''s death in combat. Summoning Cortland from the dinner table, Muggs gives him the bad news. Grief-stricken, Cortland faints and the boys carry him to his room. While upstairs, they sneak into Roy''s room and find a cap worn by one of the robbers. Muggs vows to reform the boy, and after the party, the boys follow Roy to the pool hall.
In the ensuing fight, Roy runs away and Muggs and the others chase him. During the mêlée, the crooks capture Skinny (Billy Benedict) and take him hostage. When the boys catch Roy, Muggs challenges him to a boxing match to teach him a lesson. Hearing shouts coming from the gymnasium, Cortland goes to investigate and overhears Muggs interrogating Roy about the robbery. Soon after, Louise appears and announces that she has just received a phone call from Lefty (Gabriel Dell), one of the crooks, who is threatening to harm Skinny if Roy informs on him. Angered, Roy agrees to lead the boys to Lefty''s hideout. Once there, a brawl ensues and Muggs sends Roy home to safety.
After subduing the crooks, Muggs and the boys deliver them to Capt. Mathews at police headquarters. Soon after, Roy enters the captain''s office and turns himself in. When Muggs eloquently defends Roy and pleads for leniency, the captain decides to release Roy and suggests that Muggs champion the boy''s case in court. Just then, Cortland arrives and, after forgiving his son, offers Muggs and the boys his heartfelt thanks.','["Wallace Fox"]',NULL,'["Leo Gorcey","Huntz Hall","Gabriel Dell"]','["Comedy"]','6.0','["tt0035092","tt0035345","tt0033613","tt0034420","tt0033144","tt0034224","tt0033428","tt0032277","tt0034973","tt0036073","tt0034064","tt0023969"]','["Comedy"]','[{"url":"/the_million_dollar_kid.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/the_million_dollar_kid_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/the_million_dollar_kid_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','the_million_dollar_kid',42293,'Q12061809','wp','["Frank H.

('tt0379225','free','The Corporation (2003)','2003','2h 25min','The documentary shows the development of the contemporary business corporation, from a legal entity that originated as a government-chartered institution meant to affect specific public functions to the rise of the modern commercial institution entitled to most of the legal rights of a person. The documentary concentrates mostly upon North American corporations, especially those in the United States. One theme is its assessment of corporations as persons, as a result of an 1886 case in the United States Supreme Court in which a statement by Chief Justice Morrison R. Waite led to corporations as "persons" having the same rights as human beings, based on the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
Topics addressed include the Business Plot, where in 1933, General Smedley Butler exposed an alleged corporate plot against then U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt; the tragedy of the commons; Dwight D. Eisenhower''s warning people to beware of the rising military-industrial complex; economic externalities; suppression of an investigative news story about Bovine Growth Hormone on  Fox affiliate television station WTVT in Tampa, Florida at the behest of Monsanto; the invention of the soft drink Fanta by The Coca-Cola Company due to the trade embargo on Nazi Germany; the alleged role of IBM in the Nazi holocaust (see IBM and the Holocaust); the Cochabamba protests of 2000 brought on by the privatization of a municipal water supply in Bolivia; and in general themes of corporate social responsibility, the notion of limited liability, the corporation as a psychopath, and the corporate personhood debate.
Through vignettes and interviews, The Corporation examines and criticizes corporate business practices. The film''s assessment is affected via the diagnostic criteria in the DSM-IV; Robert D. Hare, a University of British Columbia psychology professor and a consultant to the FBI, compares the profile of the contemporary profitable business corporation to that of a clinically diagnosed psychopath (however, Hare has objected to the manner in which his views are portrayed in the film; see "Critical reception" below).  The Corporation attempts to compare the way corporations are systematically compelled to behave with what it claims are the DSM-IV''s symptoms of psychopathy, e.g., the callous disregard for the feelings of other people, the incapacity to maintain human relationships, the reckless disregard for the safety of others, the deceitfulness (continual lying to deceive for profit), the incapacity to experience guilt, and the failure to conform to social norms and respect the law.',NULL,'["Joel Bakan","Joel Bakan"]','["Mikela Jay","Rob Beckwermert","Christopher Gora"]','[""]','8.1','["tt0104810","tt2145874","tt1016268","tt0912593","tt2215151","tt1645089","tt2752724","tt1189345","tt1232207","tt0436971","tt1671513","tt1954955"]','["Documentary; History"]','[{"url":"/TheCorporation-Movie-Part1.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/TheCorporation-Movie-Part1_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/TheCorporation-Movie-Part2.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/TheCorporation-Movie-Part2_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/TheCorporation-Supplement-JoelBakanInterview.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/TheCorporation-Supplement-JoelBakanInterview_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/The_Corporation__archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','The_Corporation_',99033,'Q1475460','wp',NULL,'["Mark Achbar","Jennifer Abbott"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Francis explains she is his "fiancée" and that they have suffered a great ordeal. Most of the rest of the film is a flashback of Francis''s story, which takes place in Holstenwall, a shadowy village of twisted buildings and spiraling streets. Francis and his friend Alan (Hans Heinz v. Twardowski), who are good-naturedly competing for Jane''s affections, plan to visit the town fair. Meanwhile, a mysterious man named Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss) seeks a permit from the rude town clerk to present a spectacle at the fair, which features a somnambulist named Cesare (Conrad Veidt). The clerk mocks and berates Caligari, but ultimately approves the permit. That night, the clerk is found stabbed to death in his bed.
The next morning, Francis and Alan visit Caligari''s spectacle, where he opens a coffin-like box to reveal the sleeping Cesare. Upon Caligari''s orders, Cesare awakens and answers questions from the audience. Despite Francis''s protests, Alan asks, "How long will I live?" To Alan''s horror, Cesare answers, "Until dawn." Later that night, a figure breaks into Alan''s home and stabs him to death in his bed. A grief-stricken Francis investigates Alan''s murder with help from Jane and her father, Dr. Olsen (Rudolph Lettinger), who obtains police authorization to investigate the somnambulist. That night, the police apprehend a criminal in possession of a knife (Rudolf Klein-Rogge) who is caught attempting to murder an elderly woman. When questioned by Francis and Dr. Olson, the criminal confesses he tried to kill the elderly woman, but denies any part in the two previous deaths; he was merely taking advantage of the situation to divert blame onto the real murderer.
At night, Francis spies on Caligari and observes what appears to be Cesare sleeping in his box. However, the real Cesare sneaks into Jane''s home as she sleeps. He raises a knife to stab her, but instead abducts her after a struggle, dragging her through the window onto the street. Chased by an angry mob, Cesare eventually drops Jane and flees; he soon collapses and dies. Francis also confirms that the caught criminal has been locked away and could not have been the attacker. Francis and the police investigate Caligari''s sideshow and realize that the ''Cesare'' sleeping in the box is only a dummy. Caligari escapes in the confusion. Francis follows and sees Caligari go through the entrance of an insane asylum.
Upon further investigation, Francis is shocked to learn that Caligari is the asylum''s director. With help from the asylum staff, Francis studies the director''s records and diary while the director is sleeping. The writings reveal his obsession with the story of an 18th-century mystic named Caligari, who used a somnambulist named Cesare to commit murders in northern Italian towns. The director, attempting to understand the earlier Caligari, experiments on a somnambulist admitted to the asylum, who becomes his Cesare. The director screams, "I must become Caligari!" Francis and the doctors call the police to Caligari''s office, where they show him Cesare''s corpse. Caligari then attacks one of the staff. He is subdued, restrained in a straitjacket, and becomes an inmate in his own asylum.
The narrative returns to the present, where Francis concludes his story. In a twist ending, Francis is depicted as an asylum inmate. Jane and Cesare are patients as well; Jane believes she is a queen, while Cesare is not a somnambulist but awake, quiet, and not visibly dangerous. The man Francis refers to as "Dr. Caligari" is the asylum director. Francis attacks him and is restrained in a straitjacket, then placed in the same cell where Caligari was confined in Francis''s story. The director announces that, now that he understands Francis''s delusion, he is confident he can cure him.','["Robert Wiene"]','["Carl Mayer","Hans Janowitz"]','["Werner Krauss","Conrad Veidt","Friedrich Feher"]','["Fantasy","Horror","Mystery","Thriller"]','8.1','["tt0013442","tt0015648","tt0000417","tt0020530","tt0021884","tt0021814","tt0017136","tt0000439","tt0015064","tt0016220","tt0026138","tt0016847"]','["Silent; Fantasy; Horror; German Expressionism"]','[{"url":"/DasKabinettdesDoktorCaligariTheCabinetofDrCaligari_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/The_Cabinet_of_Dr._Caligari_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','DasKabinettdesDoktorCaligariTheCabinetofDrCaligari',435884,'Q153886','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Minnie then parachutes out of the plane using her bloomers. While distracted by her, Mickey loses control of the plane and eventually crashes into a tree. Minnie then lands, and Mickey laughs at her.

Unfortunately, most of the inheritance is consumed by taxes and legal fees, and he is left with only a rickety but fully provisioned yacht and a private island in the Pacific Ocean. Stan and Ollie leave for the island, accompanied by stateless refugee Antoine (Max Elloy) and stowaway Giovanni Copini, a malcontent Italian bricklayer (Adriano Rimoldi).
On the voyage, the friendly Antoine acts as chef, but the food mysteriously disappears from Stan''s plate because stowaway Giovanni is taking it. This leads Stan to blame Ollie and an argument ensues. The engine then fails, so Ollie removes parts in an attempt to fix it. He hands them to Stan, who puts them on the deck where they slide overboard. Ollie then realises that his efforts were in vain when he notices that the fuel gauge reads empty. Having lost the engine, they hoist the sail, revealing Giovanni hiding in it.
They encounter a storm and Stan battles with an inflating liferaft in the cabin while Ollie is at the helm. They are shipwrecked on a newly emerged desert island, which they dub "Crusoeland" after the book Robinson Crusoe that is on their yacht. They are soon joined by Chérie Lamour, a nightclub singer (Suzy Delair) who is fleeing her jealous fiancé Jack Frazer, a naval lieutenant (Luigi Tosi). The island is established as a new republic, with Hardy as president and Laurel as "the people." They write a constitution declaring their atoll will have no laws, no taxes, and no immigration controls.
All goes well until the singer''s fiancé arrives to confirm the island is rich with uranium deposits. People from all over the world flock to "Atoll K" as it has been named, but soon the situation turns chaotic when a revolt seeks to overthrow and execute the island''s original inhabitants.

U.S. intelligence agent Jim Carter is sent to Japan as a National Weekly Indicator journalist to find Taro Matsudo who is helping the Communists there. Matsudo happens to be Carter''s college friend. In his hotel, Carter meets Steffi Novak, a mysterious woman who speaks six languages and wishes to accompany him. Together they are taken to a bar by Joe, an undercover agent posing as a taxi driver. Carter tries to approach Taro but he does not want to meet Jim. Back at his hotel, Jim receives a telegram informing him to reach Enoshima island. Here he meets Taro who refuses to divulge any information about his commander. He meets Taro''s father Matsudo, a government official, who tells him that Matsudo aspired to be a kamikaze pilot but when Japan surrendered during World War II, he was disappointed with the government and sided with the Communists. When Jim returns to his hotel room, he is beaten by a group of Japanese men who tell him to stay away from Taro.
Meanwhile, Steffi meets Oyama who promises her that in return for spying on Carter she would be able to meet her sister in North Korea. Unknown to Steffi her sister is dead. She takes Cater to meet Oyama at an enkai party at a resort in Atami. Somehow, Carter learns that the food offered to him is poisoned. He is forced to eat it and heads back to the hotel and unexpectedly survives. Next, he goes to Tokyo''s Takarazuka Theater where he meets Taro''s lover Namiko. Here he gains a lot of information about Taro. After he leaves, Namiko is kidnapped and thrown from a moving car; she is hospitalized soon after. Once Taro learns of the incident, he rushes to meet her but refuses to believe that his organization had any involvement with the accident. After having gained evidences of Steffi spying on him, Carter arrests her. When she tells him that she was doing this to meet her sister, Carter informs her that her sister was murdered at Oyama''s orders. Steffi vows revenge against Oyama and resolves to help Carter.
Oyama intends to provoke a railroad strike in order to halt the war efforts. Matsudo and Taro face each other at the railway tracks, where both of them give speeches to the workers. In a short period the gathering turns into a brawl and several people, including Matsudo are badly injured. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department intervenes to restore peace. Taro decides to meet Namiko at the hospital but finds her dead. Oyama''s henchmen take him to his office and when Taro learns of Oyama''s plan to kill Carter, Steffi and Matsudo by a time bomb explosion, he jumps out of the window to draw them away from the bench under which the bomb is placed. Carter reaches Oyama''s place with his associates and the police. Seeing no option left, Oyama confesses his crimes, angering his right-hand man who stabs him for disloyalty towards their organization; the man is shot and Oyama dies.

Clay had once loved Braxton''s wife Kathy (Barbara Payton) and still does.  When war is declared they soon find themselves fighting on opposite sides of the Civil War.
By 1864, Clay now a Field Artillery Major in the Confederacy is renowned for accepting but surviving suicide missions.  He is given another.  To delay General Sherman''s March to the Sea, a local guide can lead a party of men and their disassembled cannon inside caves that lead to the top of Devil''s Mountain where a battery of guns can destroy the railroad and the Union troop and supply trains that travel it, buying time for the Confederacy.  Devil''s Mountain is coincidentally near Braxton (who is now fighting elsewhere for the Confederacy) and Kathy''s old plantation where Kathy remains with her uncle.  Kathy agrees to monitor the activities of the Northern invaders and signal Clay''s outpost from her window through a mirror by day and a lantern by night. Through her activities, Clay''s men are notified of the arrival two supply trains and destroy both of them.
Arriving at the plantation is Will, who is now a Major in the Union Field Artillery.  When the two men meet each other in combat, neither knows it as each is in an artillery position hundreds of yards from the other. However, the love of Clay''s life, Kathy Summers, does know and tries desperately to save her two good friends from killing each other.
The Union Field Artillery cannot achieve the elevation or range with their cannon to clear the Confederate guns at the top of the mountain.  Inside the mountain, the Union Infantry cannot find the path to the top and are delayed by Confederate snipers.
As the railroad line has been blocked by two destroyed trains, Union headquarters send a giant Naval Dahlgren gun manned by sailors and mounted on a flat car that has the capability to wipe out the Confederates.  Kathy is able to supply Clay''s guns with wire from her piano that is used to reinforce the barrel of one of Clay''s guns that with a double charge and maximum elevation is able to destroy the naval gun and further block the railroad line.
Will has Union Army Engineers mine the inside of the mountain with explosives that will literally blow the top of the mountain. Kathy wishes to act as a mediator to get Clay and his men to surrender that the Union army is keen on as it will save time.  However, Clay calculates that the explosion will send the cliff down over the railway line further blocking the Union''s supplies.','["William Cameron Menzies"]','["Philip Yordan","Sidney Harmon"]','["James Craig","Barbara Payton","Guy Madison"]','["Drama","History","Romance","War","Western"]','5.8','["tt0037449","tt0045954","tt0043885","tt0043360","tt0048396","tt0011387","tt0042372","tt0042648","tt0046258","tt0045840","tt0045787","tt0046463"]','["war;civil war;war between the states;"]','[{"url":"/DrumsInTheDeepSouth.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Drums_in_the_Deep_South.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Drums_in_the_Deep_South_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','Drums_in_the_Deep_South',106710,'Q5309291','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

She has been told that her father has died, and is returning to find out what will be done with the estate. They arrive on a stormy night, and are greeted by her invalid uncle Robert, the housekeeper Mrs. Krug and the housekeeper''s son Hanns.
While exploring the mansion, Ruth is dismayed to find a large ape her father used to conduct experiments in the basement. She and the others then gather to learn how the Earlton estate will be divided. Earlton has left his estate to Ruth, but it will go to her uncle Robert in the event of her death. Very small monthly sums are also left to the housekeeper Mrs. Krug and her son Hanns, and these two are very upset about the small amount of the allowance.
When Ruth goes to bed that night, a large, hairy hand reaches through the headboard and attempts to strangle her. When she screams, it disappears. Her fiance and Mrs. Krug arrive at her room, and attempt to comfort her. Ted gives her a sleeping potion, and she falls asleep in a chair in her room while Mrs. Krug stays with her, taking the bed.
The hairy hand reappears through the headboard and strangles Mrs. Krug this time, killing her. Ruth awakens and alerts the rest of the household to what has happened. Afterward, Hanns Krug meets with Robert Earlton in secret, who tells him that their plan to kill Ruth Earlton has failed and Hanns has accidentally murdered his own mother. Hanns blames Robert for this, and after mentioning that Robert is actually his father, he strangles him as well, leaving him for dead.
Dr. Clayton visits Robert''s room, and Robert regains consciousness. He tells Clayton about the plan he and Hanns had to murder Ruth, so that the estate would go to them instead. Clayton rushes out to find Ruth and warn her. She has already been taken by Hanns to the basement though, where he attempts to force the ape to kill her. The ape turns on him instead, killing him.

To decompress, she leaves for a weekend trip in upstate New York with her new stockbroker boyfriend Robert, her sister Shirley, and their openly gay friend Nicky. They arrive to the country late in the evening, and stop in a small town. Robert, Marie, and Shirley pick up groceries at a market, where Shirley finds a sinister face mask that she decides to buy as a joke. Meanwhile, Nicky goes to the bar across the street for a drink, and is harassed by two homophobic men whom he beats up.
They arrive at the remote farmhouse Robert has recently purchased from Otis, a local man whose father has died, and whom Robert has hired to build a large schooner, a project which is being housed in a barn on the property. Jay Alsop, an engineer and friend of Robert''s, arrives to oversee the boat''s progress. A lumberman providing the wood for the boat, Mac Macauley, tells Marie of a local rumor involving a young woman who was assaulted by the unhinged Otis, and hints that he may have been responsible for a murder.
Jay quickly develops a sexual interest in Shirley. Meanwhile, Marie finds herself attracted to Mac. The following afternoon, Jay goes down to the barn to check on Otis''s progress on the boat; there, he is strangled by a killer donning the mask Shirley bought the day before, his body hung from the rafters so as to appear as a suicide. That night, the rest of the group dresses up for a formal dinner at the house. After dinner, Marie and Robert go for a walk on the property, and discover Jay''s body hanging in the barn. Horrified, they rush back to the house.
Meanwhile, an inebriated Shirley puts on a tango record and performs a striptease for Nicky. The two dance together on the house''s second floor, and jokingly apply makeup to each other''s faces. The killer attacks Nicky upstairs, stabbing him through the head with a large sewing needle. Shirley is chased into the basement, where the killer ties her to a table saw and attempts to kill her with it, but cannot get power to the tool. Robert and Marie reach the house, and are confronted by the killer. Robert discovers Nicky''s body upstairs, and is thrown to his death out of the second story window. The killer then returns to the ground floor, where he reveals himself to be Greg. He tells Marie that he plans on taking her out into the lake and committing a murder-suicide.
The next morning, Mac arrives at the house, and finds it empty. As he goes to investigate the basement, he turns on a light switch which activates the table saw, inadvertently killing Shirley, who has been tied to the table all night.

When another of its two-member crew Pegasus spacecraft mysteriously disappears, rumors begin circulating of space monsters and phantom planets. Captain Frank Chapman and his navigator Lt. Ray Makonnen are ordered to investigate.
During the search, their spaceship suffers damage from a meteor shower, requiring that both men go outside to make repairs. A bullet-sized particle, however, pierces the air hose on Chapman''s space suit, rendering him unconscious. Makonnen is able to repair the hose, but as he opens the airlock hatch, he is fatally struck by a similar particle. Makonnen''s last act before being propelled into deep space is to push Chapman inside and close the airlock hatch. Chapman comes to and finds Makonnen gone and himself unable to communicate with the lunar base. He records a log entry about the preceding events, noting that he now must make a forced landing on an asteroid, that it is somehow pulling in his Pegasus spaceship.
Exiting his ship while still feeling the effects of the accident, Chapman collapses and sees tiny humanoids about six inches tall approaching. Once his helmet visor is opened, he can breathe but shrinks to their size due to the asteroid''s atmosphere. He is taken underground.
Sesom, the aged and wise ruler of Rheton (the native name for the rocky and seemingly lifeless planetoid where Chapman has landed), explains that though his craft was brought down safely by their gravitational tractor beam, they had not been able to do same with the preceding Earth spaceships that came near, which were completely destroyed, along with their crews, when they crashed on Rheton''s surface. He informs Chapman that he never can leave but will have all the rights of a citizen of Rheton. As he slept, Chapman''s spaceship was sent into space to keep Rheton''s existence a secret, and more importantly, their world''s gravitational technology, which allows the Rhetonians to navigate their world through space.
Chapman meets two beautiful women: Sesom''s smugly spoiled blond daughter Liara and the gentle but mute black-haired Zetha. Liara is more than willing to answer his many questions about Rheton. Sesom informs Chapman that he later may marry one of the women once he has become accustomed to living on Rheton.
Liara, after following and engaging constantly with Chapman, declares her love for him, but Chapman, still eager to return to his own people, quietly rejects her. Herron, a young man who is in love with Liara, attempts to win her for himself by lying to Sesom, telling him Chapman is attempting to win over both women.
Stating that he believes this to be a crime against the people of Rheton, Herron requests a duel to the death. Chapman agrees, and the two engage in a form of combat where opponents must push each other onto gravity plates that cause immediate disintegration when touched. Just as Chapman is about to push Herron onto a plate, he lets Herron go, stating that he cannot kill someone for no reason.
As time goes on, Chapman and the mute Zetha become acquainted and eventually fall in love. Herron comes to Chapman late one night and offers to help him escape.
Any plans for the future, however, are put on hold when Chapman discovers the reason for Rheton''s erratic course through space: It is because the planetoid is being attacked by the Solarites, an alien race of "fire people" from an unidentified "sun satellite". They want to destroy Rheton with their flaming fighter craft so they can steal its secret of gravitational control.
With Chapman''s help, Sesom and Herron destroy the enemy fleet using a gravity beam. During the battle, a giant 7-inch tall Solarite prisoner, captured during a previous raid, escapes when the gravity barrier holding him fails. Stalking corridors, the creature captures Zetha, who previously had been traumatized into silence by a childhood encounter with the savage species. After Sesom is attacked by this bug-eyed monster, Chapman and Herron attempt to rescue Zetha. Chapman defeats the Solarite by pushing it onto a gravity plate.
While kidnapped, Zetha''s muteness vanished when she saw Chapman about to be attacked by the creature, and she was able to scream, warning him. The return of her voice allows her to later confess her love for him. The two kiss, but Zetha knows that he must return to his home world.

Brazos takes the body to the Banner ranch, but the ruthless Banner (Griff Barnett) has him arrested for the murder by Yount (Grant Withers), a corrupt deputy. Brazos has the bullet that killed his friend and slips it to Jane Banner (Dorothy Hart), the rancher''s daughter.

Aubrey Smith) work furiously to complete a design on time, even though it is Christmas Eve. Michael O''Brien (Charles Winninger), the third partner in the firm, arrives with presents for all and kindly lets their employees leave. The three old men then go home to the mansion they share with Madame Tanya (Maria Ouspenskaya), an elderly countess dispossessed by the Russian Revolution, for a dinner with prestigious guests.
When the guests cancel at the last minute, George is convinced it is because of his dark past. To relieve George''s black mood, Michael comes up with an idea to obtain new guests for dinner. Each man throws out a wallet containing $10 and his business card into the street. George''s is found by Arlene Terry (Helen Vinson), who merely gives the money to her driver and discards the wallet. However, the other two are returned by more considerate people: Texas cowboy James Houston (Richard Carlson) and teacher Jean Lawrence (Jean Parker). They stay for dinner and soon become good friends with the three men and Madame Tanya. James and Jean also fall in love with each other, delighting the three men.
When the engineers have to travel to another city on business, Madame Tanya begs Michael to take the train rather than fly. He assures her it is perfectly safe, but Madame Tanya''s premonition proves tragically correct when their aircraft crashes in a storm, killing all three. When James and Jean come to announce that they are engaged, they receive the bad news. The ghosts of the three men return home, where they are dimly sensed by Madame Tanya.
It turns out that Michael had bequeathed some bonds to the young couple so they could afford to marry. The story is picked up by the press, and as a result, James is invited to be a guest on a radio show. This is the opportunity he has been waiting for to showcase his wonderful singing voice. At the studio, James bumps into Arlene Terry, an established singing star. She wishes him well and is impressed by his performance. She had been wanting to replace her aging partner; she and her manager, Phil Hubert (Rod LaRocque), offer James a starring role in her new show. He accepts. 
As James spends time with Arlene rehearsing, he becomes infatuated with her and neglects Jean, much to the distress of the ghosts, who are powerless to do anything. When Arlene''s ex-husband bangs on her door, she has James leave by the back door, but not before persuading him to take a three-day break from work with her in the country. 
George is summoned to leave the world. Michael begs him to repent before it is too late, but George refuses to be a hypocrite and walks away amid thunder and lightning into the darkness. Soon it is Allan''s turn. His son David (William Bakewell) comes to take him to Heaven to be reunited with his wife. When Michael is called, he refuses to leave James, although a voice tells him each person is summoned only once and that he will be doomed to roam the Earth forever if he turns it down.
When Arlene leaves her apartment to meet James, her ex-husband is waiting. He needs her help to get back on his feet. However, she coldly brushes him off. When Arlene and James drive away, the jealous, estranged husband follows and shoots them when they stop for dinner. James dies on the operating table with his spirit greeted by Michael who then intercedes on his behalf, pleading with a "voice from above", for a second chance for the young man. His wish is granted and James returns to life. Michael is reunited with a now-repentant George, and both are admitted into Heaven.','["A.

To prevent Aunt Abigail from losing her home, Sally is about to agree to marry the son, even though she loves the hired hand Joel (Butler). She has only a few days to decide before the mortgage falls due. That night former jockey Tim Vail breaks into the home looking for food, and sweet Aunt Abigail gives him a job on the farm.

The Hammerheads, discovering that the horse would likely beat their entry, attempt to keep her out of the race by setting fire to the barn, but Tim rescues the horse.

After the briefing, Lt. Robertson reports to the base near the expected target where he berates his subordinates for their habit of using the monitoring equipment to spy on teenagers making out in the woods. One of the teens sees an object land nearby and tells his friends at a local bar, including Stan Kenyon. Stan and his girlfriend Susan Rogers later accidentally hit one of the multi-eyed, lumpy greyish-white aliens from the ship with his car, so they drive off to call the police. Out in the woods, they are forced to use the phone of a grumpy local codger who resents the "smoochers" who use his property as a lovers'' lane, frequently threatening them with a shotgun.
Meanwhile, one of two drunken drifters new in town comes across the dead creature and decides to put it on exhibition as part of his latest get-rich-quick scheme. When he returns to the site after excitedly rushing home to tell his buddy Mike, other aliens arrive, scaring him and causing a deadly heart attack. When the police finally investigate, they assume that Stan has run over the drifter and arrest the young man, refusing to believe his crazy story.
Having overheard the bar conversation about the UFO, Lt. Robertson reports to his commander, who reluctantly authorizes a cordon around the saucer. They eventually accidentally blow up the spaceship and congratulate themselves for their effective defense, not realizing that the creatures were not in their craft and are still roaming the woods.
Easily escaping from the police, Stan and Susan meet up with the dead drifter''s friend Mike and the three of them attempt to prove the alien danger to the community. Mike is cornered and attacked by the angry creatures, but Stan and Susan manage to flee and accidentally discover the monsters explode when exposed to bright light. Unfortunately, after the autopsy shows that the victim earlier died from an alcohol-induced heart attack and that Stan had not killed him, the police want nothing more to do with him and refuse to help. The teenagers then gather their friends together and drive out to the clearing where they left Mike. Surrounding the aliens with their cars, the teens use their headlights to evaporate the remaining creatures.

Joh Fredersen is the city''s master. His son Freder idles away his time at sports and in a pleasure garden, but is interrupted by the arrival of a young woman named Maria, who has brought a group of workers'' children to witness the lifestyle of their rich "brothers". Maria and the children are ushered away, but Freder, fascinated, goes to the lower levels to find her. On the machine levels he witnesses the explosion of a huge machine that kills and injures numerous workers. Freder has a hallucination that the machine is Moloch and the workers are being fed to it. When the hallucination ends and he sees the dead workers being carried away on stretchers, he hurries to tell his father about the accident. Fredersen asks his assistant, Josaphat, why he learned of the explosion from his son, and not from him.
Grot, foreman of the Heart Machine, brings Fredersen secret maps found on the dead workers. Fredersen again asks Josaphat why he did not learn of the maps from him, and fires him. After seeing his father''s cold indifference towards the harsh conditions they face, Freder secretly rebels against him by deciding to help the workers. He enlists Josaphat''s assistance and returns to the machine halls, where he trades places with a worker.
Fredersen takes the maps to the inventor Rotwang to learn their meaning. Rotwang had been in love with a woman named Hel, who left him to marry Fredersen and later died giving birth to Freder. Rotwang shows Fredersen a robot he has built to "resurrect" Hel. The maps show a network of catacombs beneath Metropolis, and the two men go to investigate. They eavesdrop on a gathering of workers, including Freder. Maria addresses them, prophesying the arrival of a mediator who can bring the working and ruling classes together. Freder believes he could fill the role and declares his love for Maria. Fredersen orders Rotwang to give Maria''s likeness to the robot so that it can ruin her reputation among the workers to prevent any rebellion. Fredersen is unaware that Rotwang plans to use the robot to kill Freder and take over Metropolis. Rotwang kidnaps Maria, transfers her likeness to the robot and sends her to Fredersen. Freder finds the two embracing and, believing it is the real Maria, falls into a prolonged delirium. Intercut with his hallucinations, the false Maria unleashes chaos throughout Metropolis, driving men to murder and stirring dissent among the workers.
Freder recovers and returns to the catacombs. Finding the false Maria urging the workers to rise up and destroy the machines, Freder accuses her of not being the real Maria. The workers follow the false Maria from their city to the machine rooms, leaving their children behind. They destroy the Heart Machine, which causes the workers'' city below to flood. The real Maria, having escaped from Rotwang''s house, rescues the children with Freder''s and Josaphat''s help. Grot berates the celebrating workers for abandoning their children in the flooded city. Believing their children to be dead, the hysterical workers capture the false Maria and burn her at the stake. A horrified Freder watches, not understanding the deception until the fire reveals her to be a robot. Rotwang is delusional, seeing the real Maria as his lost Hel, and chases her to the roof of the cathedral, pursued by Freder. The two men fight as Fredersen and the workers watch from the street. Rotwang falls to his death. Freder fulfills his role as mediator by linking the hands of Fredersen and Grot to bring them together.','["Fritz Lang"]','["Thea von Harbou","Thea von Harbou"]','["Brigitte Helm","Alfred Abel","Gustav Fröhlich"]','["Drama","Sci-Fi"]','8.3','["tt0022100","tt0040522","tt0033467","tt9354944","tt0013442","tt0010323","tt0045152","tt0032553","tt0036775","tt8956872","tt0041959","tt0047478"]','["Lang;sci-fi;feature films"]','[{"url":"/Metropolis1925-ShorterVersion_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/Metropolis1925Vhs_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','Metropolis1925-ShorterVersion',26382,'Q151599','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Wrecker Tom Kemp accuses Duke of jinxing every project on which he works, and after foreman Matt Carney breaks up the ensuing fistfight, he assigns Duke, an arrogant risk-taker, to work with him on the building''s high watertower. While aloft, Matt slips and desperately clings to the edge of the tower, and Duke casually jokes with him before pulling him to safety. Later, Mike, who took over the business after her husband''s death, tells Matt that she has put up a bond to save the company, and that they only have four weeks to bring down the twelve-story building.
Wrecker Joe Poska then hosts a christening party after his wife Martha gives birth to a baby boy, but the wreckers have to leave suddenly to reinforce a section of unstable wall on the top of the hotel. The work goes smoothly until Joe accidentally falls to his death down the refuse chute while helping Duke dump a load of bricks. Joe''s death reinforces Kemp''s theory about the jinx, and Duke blames himself. While walking disconsolately on the street, Duke donates money to a missionary, who predicts that he will lighten someone''s burden. Soon after, Duke rescues Peggy Starr when she is thrown out of a café for trying to steal money for food, then attempts to jump into the river. Duke introduces Peggy to his friends as his cousin, and attributes his new good luck to her. After Matt falls for Peggy, both he and Duke convince Mike to hire her as a secretary.
While work on the building continues, Peggy dates both Duke and Matt. Duke is promoted to the position of night foreman so that they can speed up demolition by maintaining two shifts. Kemp quits to avoid working with Duke, and while there are many near misses, no one is injured in an accident, convincing Duke that Peggy has broken his jinx. One day after breaking through a wall, Duke finds a cache of hidden money. Duke shares the money with his helper and his pal, Freddy Bunce, who needs money for arm surgery which would help him return to his true vocation as a baseball pitcher. Duke also generously gives Martha some money, saying that it is a donation from the night crew. Later, Matt proposes to Peggy, but she is hesitant to respond because she is torn between him and Duke.
One night, Matt catches Duke and Freddy showing off for an audience of women on the sidewalk, and warns Duke to put away the wrecking ball for which Duke is nicknamed. Duke secures the ball, but when he later refuses to rehire Kemp because he is drunk, Kemp angrily releases it. The runaway "cannonball" severely injures a worker, Emil, and causes structural damage to the building, resulting in the crew''s having to reinforce the building before they can continue to take it down floor by floor. 
After Duke is blamed for the accident and threatens to quit, he asks Peggy to marry him. Convinced that Duke is acting irresponsibly, Peggy rejects him, prompting Duke to pick a fight with Matt, during which Mike learns that Peggy is not really his cousin. Mike breaks up the fight as a section of the hotel wall collapses, rendering the building unstable again. Duke leaves angrily while Matt and the crew try to stabilize the structure. As Matt climbs onto an unsteady girder, a hospital worker informs Mike that after regaining consciousness, Emil named Kemp as being responsible for his injury. 
Mike tries to call Duke, but he has already moved out of his boardinghouse. Duke again encounters the missionary, who advises him never to falter in helping a friend. Inspired by the advice, Duke returns to the worksite just as a supporting wall collapses and Matt is trapped under a girder. Duke climbs up to save Matt, but is then trapped with his friend when another section of the wall collapses. They are finally saved by Freddy, who, although recovering from his operation, risks his baseball career to throw them a lifeline. 
Some time later, Matt and Peggy begin their honeymoon at the Empire State Building, and Duke nearly falls off while he is kidding around with Mike.','["Frank McDonald"]','["Robert T.

Robinson), a meek amateur painter and cashier for a clothing retailer, is fêted by his employer for twenty-five years of service. After company head J.J. Hogarth presents Chris with a gold watch and kind words, he leaves the party and gets into a car with a beautiful young blonde. Chris muses to an associate about his desire to be loved by a young woman like that.
Walking home through Greenwich Village, Chris sees a young woman, Katherine "Kitty" March (Joan Bennett), being attacked and knocks her assailant unconscious with his umbrella. Chris, unaware that the attacker is Johnny (Dan Duryea), Kitty''s boyfriend, summons a nearby policeman, but Johnny regains consciousness and flees. After Chris walks Kitty to her apartment building, she accepts his offer of a cup of coffee at a nearby bar. From Chris''s comments about art, Kitty mistakes him for a wealthy painter.
Chris becomes enamored of Kitty. He is stuck in a loveless marriage with his shrewish wife Adele (Rosalind Ivan), who idolizes her previous husband, a policeman believed drowned in the East River while trying to rescue a suicidal woman. After Chris confesses that he is married, Johnny convinces Kitty to feign a romantic interest in Chris to swindle money from him. Kitty inveigles Chris to rent her an apartment which doubles as his art studio. To finance the apartment, Chris steals $500 in insurance bonds from his wife and later $1000 cash from his employer.
Unknown to Chris, Johnny tries selling some of his paintings, leaving them with a Greenwich village street vendor who thinks them worth no more than $25. They unexpectedly attract the interest of art critic David Janeway (Jess Barker), who believes them to be exceptional art. After Johnny persuades Kitty to pretend that she painted them, she charms Janeway with Chris''s own descriptions of his art. Captivated by the paintings  and Kitty, Janeway promises to represent her. However, Adele sees her husband''s paintings—signed "Katherine March"—for sale in the window of a commercial art gallery and accuses Chris of copying March''s work. Chris confronts Kitty, who claims she sold them because she needed the money. He is so delighted that his paintings are appreciated, albeit under a ruse, that he happily lets her become the public face of his art. She becomes a huge commercial success, although Chris never receives any of the money.
Adele''s supposedly dead first husband, Higgins (Charles Kemper), suddenly appears at Chris''s office to extort money from him. He explains he did not drown, but disappeared after stealing $2,700 from the purse of the suicidal woman he tried to save. Already suspected of taking bribes from speakeasies, he faked his death to escape his crimes and his wife. Chris lets Higgins into Adele''s room—ostensibly to pilfer the insurance money Adele received after his supposed death—aware she is asleep in the room; Chris assumes that his marriage will be invalidated when his wife wakes and sees her first husband is still alive.
Chris goes to see Kitty, believing he is now free to marry her. Instead he finds Johnny and Kitty in an embrace, confirming his suspicions that they are romantically involved. Believing her infatuation with Johnny is fleeting, Chris asks Kitty to marry him; she spurns him for being old and ugly and laughs in his face. Enraged, he stabs her to death with an ice pick. The police visit Chris for embezzling money from his employer. Although his boss refuses to press charges, Chris is fired. Johnny is arrested for Kitty''s murder.
At the trial, all of Johnny''s small-time hustling and deceptions work against him. Despite his attempt to implicate Chris in Kitty''s murder, Chris denies painting the pictures, claiming to be an untalented artist. Several witnesses confirm Chris''s testimony and attest to Johnny''s misdeeds and bad character. Johnny is convicted and put to death for Kitty''s murder, Chris goes unpunished, and Kitty is erroneously recognized as a great artist.
Haunted by the murder, Chris attempts to hang himself. Although rescued, he is homeless and destitute, with no way of claiming credit for his own paintings.

When Ollie learns about Stan''s stash, he suggests they use it to have a good time.  However, before the twosome can leave, Stan''s wife finds the wallet and replaces Stan''s cash with cigar coupons—the trading stamps of the 1920s.  Thus, when Stan and Ollie head out the door Stan has no idea he his wallet no longer contains cash.  Stan and Ollie arrive outside an upscale cafe featuring live entertainment just in time to see the large head waiter roughly remove two male patrons who cannot pay their bill.  They are followed out the door by their two dates who explain they have no money to pay the check.  The girls then approach Stan and Ollie who offer to pay their outstanding restaurant bill, their accruing cab fare—and continue to treat them to a night on the town.  A busybody sees Stan and Ollie enter the cafe with two strange women.  She runs off to report this transgression to their wives.
Stan enjoys the cafe''s all-midget floor show so much that he buys them all gifts from a cigarette girl. It is then that Stan discovers his wallet contains only cigar coupons. To buy time, Stan quickly tells the cigar girl to put the cost on his tab.  When the bill finally arrives, Stan and Ollie attempt to sneak out of the cafe while the lights are dimmed during another dance performance.  This plan fails miserably and they have to flee from the angry headwaiter—and their angry wives who have arrived to confront them.

He is reluctantly working with four crooks: Peterson, Julius O''Hara, Major Jack Ross  and Ravello, who are trying to acquire uranium-rich land in British East Africa. Billy suspects that Major Ross murdered a British Colonial officer who threatened to expose their plan. While waiting in Italy for passage to Africa, Billy and his wife Maria meet a British couple, Harry and Gwendolen Chelm, who plan to travel on the same ship. Harry seems a very proper and traditional Englishman, while Gwendolen is flighty and a compulsive fantasist. Billy and Gwendolen have an affair, while Maria flirts with Harry. Peterson becomes suspicious that the Chelms may be attempting to acquire the uranium themselves. Though this is untrue, it seems confirmed by Gwendolen, who lies about her husband and exaggerates his importance.

Billy and Peterson decide to take a plane instead, but their car runs over a cliff when they are pushing it after a breakdown and the pair are wrongly reported to have been killed. In order to replace Peterson''s lost capital, Ravello approaches Harry Chelm and explains their scheme. Just then, to everyone''s surprise, Billy and Peterson return to the hotel unharmed, just as the purser announces that the ship is at last ready to sail. On board, Harry reveals that he knows about Peterson''s scheme and intends to inform the authorities. Peterson orders Major Ross to kill Harry, but Billy thwarts the murder attempt. Disbelieving Harry''s outraged accusations, however, the ship''s drunken captain has Harry locked in the brig.
The ship''s engine malfunctions and the passengers are told to escape by lifeboat. When Billy goes to rescue Harry, he finds that he has freed himself and left the ship, intending to swim ashore. Having abandoned ship, the passengers land on an African beach, where they are arrested by Arab soldiers. They are interrogated by Ahmed, an Arab official who suspects that they may be spies or revolutionaries. Billy tries to run away and befriends Ahmed when he is recaptured by talking to him about Rita Hayworth, whom Harry pretends to have known. Billy then persuades him to send the party back to Italy by sailing boat. 
After the party land, they are questioned by a Scotland Yard detective, who is investigating the murder of the Colonial officer. Just as he seems taken in by Peterson''s smooth talk, Gwendolen reveals Peterson''s scheme, his involvement in the murder and his attempt to kill Harry. The detective promptly arrests Peterson, O''Hara, Ross, and Ravello. As the four crooks are led away in handcuffs, Gwendolen receives a telegram from British East Africa saying that Harry has acquired the land where Peterson and the others were aiming to enrich themselves; he is now extremely wealthy and willing to forgive Gwendolen.

The film depicts Knievel reflecting on major events in his life, particularly his relationship with his girlfriend/wife, Linda. The film opens with Knievel at the Ontario Motor Speedway in Ontario, California. Knievel is speaking directly to the camera describing his upcoming daredevil motorcycle jump:

Ladies and gentlemen, you have no idea how good it makes me feel to be here today. It is truly an honor to risk my life for you. An honor. Before I jump this motorcycle over these 19 cars — and I want you to know there''s not a Volkswagen or a Datsun in the row — before I sail cleanly over that last truck, I want to tell you that last night a kid came up to me and he said, "Mr Knievel, are you crazy? That jump you''re going to make is impossible, but I already have my tickets because I want to see you splatter." That''s right, that''s what he said. And I told that boy last night that nothing is impossible. Now they told Columbus to sail across the ocean was impossible. They told the settlers to live in a wild land was impossible. They told the Wright Brothers to fly was impossible. And they probably told Neil Armstrong a walk on the moon was impossible. They tell Evel Knievel to jump a motorcycle across the Grand Canyon is impossible, and they say that every day. A Roman General in the time of Caesar had the motto: "If it is possible, it is done. If it is impossible, it will be done." And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what I live by.Following his introduction, the story follows a flashback narrative through Knievel''s life.
The film ends with Knievel successfully completing the jump at the Ontario Motor Speedway and riding off onto a dirt road which leads to the edge of the Grand Canyon.

The message states that Tex and his partner, Edward Barclay, have discovered a big strike in the Valley of Suspicion and urges Gene to bring as many horses as possible to Dunbar, South Africa, where he can contact John Cardigan (LeRoy Mason), the saloon owner who grubstaked Tex and Barclay. Gene and his sidekick Frog (Smiley Burnette) quickly arrange for passage overseas and accompany the horses to South Africa.
Meanwhile, Tex and his partner, while on their way back to Dunbar from their mine, are ambushed by Cardigan''s men. Barclay is killed and Tex wounded but able to escape. Cardigan wants sole control of the mine. Sometime later, Gene and Frog arrive at Dunbar and hire Barkey McCuskey, a small-time English con artist, as their auctioneer for when they sell their horses. Worried that Tex is not in Dunbar, Gene stoutly defends his brother when Cardigan tells him he is being sought for the murder of Barclay. Gene grows suspicious of Cardigan when he sees that the saloon owner tampered with another telegram from Tex. Cardigan in turn grows jealous as Gene who becomes friendly with saloon singer Gwen (Maxine Doyle), who is Barclay''s daughter.

He soon reaches local bar and restaurant Cantina Argentina. He enters the establishment with the apparent intent to relax with some drinking and smoking. (On the wall a wanted sign for Mickey saying El gaucho, meaning Mickey Mouse is a bandit or a crook.)
Already present are resident barmaid and dancer Minnie Mouse and a fellow customer. The latter is Black Pete and is soon introduced as a wanted outlaw. Pete had already been established as an antagonist in both the Alice Comedies and the Oswald the Lucky Rabbit series.  However this short marks his first encounter with either Mickey or Minnie.  The latter pair also appear unfamiliar to each other. The short apparently depicts their initial encounter.
Minnie performs the tango and salsa and both customers start flirting with her. Pete then attempts to put an early ending to their emerging rivalry by proceeding in kidnapping her. He escapes on his horse while Mickey gives chase on his rhea and soon catches up to his rival. Pete and Mickey then proceed in challenging each other to a sword duel. The latter emerges the victor (by covering Pete''s head with a chamber pot he pulls out from under a bed) and finally gets hold of Minnie.

Welles initially conducts a monologue where he recalls the events that lead up to the creation of Othello and some of the problems that plagued the production. As the film progresses, he switches to a conversation in a restaurant between himself and two of the film''s co-stars, Micheal MacLiammoir (who played Iago) and Hilton Edwards (who played Brabantio). The three men talk at length about the making of Othello.  Welles then resumes his monologue from his position behind the moviola. He then runs footage on the moviola of a question and answer session he conducted during a 1977 screening of Othello in Boston. Welles concludes the film in his position as a monologuist, proclaiming: "There are too many regrets, there are too many things I wish I could have done over again. If it wasn''t a memory, if it was a project for the future, talking about Othello would have been nothing but delight. After all, promises are more fun than explanations.

A centerpiece of the film is a long examination of the history of The New York Times'' coverage of the Indonesian occupation of East Timor, which Chomsky says exemplifies the media''s unwillingness to criticize an ally of the elite.
Until the release of The Corporation (2003), made by Mark Achbar, Jennifer Abbott and Joel Bakan, it was the most successful feature documentary in Canadian history playing theatrically in over 300 cities around the world. It appeared in more than 50 international film festivals where it received 22 awards. It was broadcast on television in over 30 markets and translated into a dozen languages.
Chomsky''s response to the film was mixed; in a published conversation with Achbar and several activists, he stated that "the positive impact of it has been astonishing to me" but people mistakenly get the impression that he is the leader of a movement that they should join.

He is shocked when he discovers a scandalous picture of his own daughter, Phyllis, on the front page of the competing paper The Daily Argus. Henry pays a visit to the dubious publisher of the competing paper, Andy McDonald, and warns him to ever publish a picture like that again, or Henry will kill him. Henry is unaware of the fact that a man named "Slippery" Joe Clary has overheard his conversation with Andy, which Joe later reveals to him, threatening to expose him. Henry counters by claiming that Andy was the one who got Joe sentenced with his testimony, and that Andy dated Joe''s girlfriend while he was in the slammer.
To avoid further complications, Henry takes a long vacation, following the suggestion of his chauffeur. While Henry is away, without his family, Slippery Joe murders publisher Andy and hides the body in the trunk of Henry''s parked car. Slippery Joe also breaks into Andy''s safe, trying to get back a written confession of a previous murder, but finds out the document must have been hidden on the Publisher''s body. Henry has brought his car on the vacation, and finds Andy''s dead body in the trunk when he arrives at his hunting lodge. Panicking, he decides to dump the body to not be accused of murder, but his chauffeur sees the body before he has a chance to realize his plan. The chauffeur, eager to protect his employer, remove the body from the trunk and hides it inside the lodge.
Visitor''s come and go at the lodge during the vacation, and the body is moved and hidden several times by the two men to avoid discovery. Soon enough Slippery Joe too comes looking for the body to retrieve the document. When Henry''s family one day discovers that he has left on vacation, they also come up to the lodge to visit. After them come additional relatives, and even a news reporter from The Daily Argus, trying to get another scandalous story to publish in the paper.
The body is discovered by every visitor to the lodge at some point, and the chauffeur has to move it constantly to confuse the guests, and Henry convinces them all that they have hallucinated. The local officer of the law, police constable Trigg, discovers Andy''s car hidden not far from the cabin, left there by Slippery Joe. Trigg immediately suspects Henry of murdering Andy and arrests him.
James, Henry''s son, falsely claims to have murdered Andy to get Henry out of jail, but then Andy''s body is found, with the confession in one of his pockets. Slippery Joe is arrested for the murder. Slippery Joe admits his guilt when he learns that Trigg has the confession, and Henry is cleared of all suspicion. After the commotion, Henry''s family promise to not ignore him anymore. Despite this, Henry finds himself sitting alone at breakfast the day after.','["Albert Herman"]','["Raymond L. Schrock","Harry O. Hoyt"]','["J.

Claiming to be checking up on security before his arrival, a group of FBI agents arrive at the home of the Bensons on top of a hill that looks down upon the station where the presidential train is scheduled to stop. However, they soon turn out to be assassins led by the ruthless John Baron (Frank Sinatra), who take over the house and hold the family hostage.
Sheriff Tod Shaw (Sterling Hayden) arrives with Dan Carney (Willis Bouchey), the Secret Service agent in charge of the president''s security detail. When he does, Baron and his gangsters shoot Carney dead and a bullet fractures Shaw''s arm.
Baron sends one of his two henchmen to double-check on the president''s schedule but he is killed in a shootout with the police. Jud (James O''Hara), a television repairman, shows up at the house and also becomes a hostage. Pidge (Kim Charney) goes to his grandfather''s dresser to get some medication and notices a fully loaded revolver which he replaces with his toy cap gun.
Baron is confronted by the sheriff on the risks and meaning of killing the president and Baron''s remaining henchman begins showing some reluctance. For Baron, however, these are the very least of his concerns and it soon becomes clear that he is a psychopath whose pleasure comes from killing – who and why he kills being of little importance to him.
A sniper''s rifle has been mounted on a metal table by a window. Jud discreetly hooks the table up to the 5000-volt plate output of the family television. Pop Benson (James Gleason) then spills a cup of water on the floor beneath the table. Although the hope is that Baron will be shocked and killed in this way, his remaining henchman touches the table first and is electrocuted, reflexively firing the rifle repeatedly and attracting the attention of police at the train station. Baron shoots and kills Jud, disconnects the electrical hook-up and aims the rifle as the president''s train arrives at the station, but to his surprise it passes straight through (the stop having been cancelled). Ellen Benson (Nancy Gates) shoots Baron in the abdomen and Shaw shoots him again.

('tt0041187','free','Blonde Ice (1948)','1948','1h 13min','Claire Cummings a society columnist for a San Francisco paper, is about to marry Carl Henneman in his opulent mansion. A small group of men - all Claire''s old co-workers from the newspaper - comment about Claire being late to her own wedding. At least two of the men attending - Les Burns and Al Herrick - are ex-lovers of Claire''s. Claire appears at the top of the stairs as the wedding march begins, making her way down the stairs and into the ceremony. As the ceremony takes place, Les leaves to go stand on the veranda, and Claire watches him, instead of focusing on her wedding. Immediately following the ceremony, Claire slips out to join Les, and tells him she still loves him, and will continue to see him, despite now being married. She kisses him, which her new husband sees. When Claire re-enters the reception, Carl confronts his new bride, who tells him that Les is like her brother, and the kiss was platonic. Luckily, Carl believes her.
While on their honeymoon in Los Angeles, Claire and Carl are at the racetrack, arguing about Claire''s recklessly betting money on random horses. Claire thinks it doesn''t matter, since Carl''s wealthy,  but Carl wants her to be more frugal. The couple return to their hotel, where Claire writes a love letter to Les. When Carl enters the room, she hides the letter under another letter she''s written to a friend, but Carl quickly discovers the letter to Les, and tells Claire he''s divorcing her. At first, she barely reacts - telling Carl that California''s a state with community property laws which entitle a spouse to half of a couple''s combined holdings. But Carl says he''s taking the letter Claire had been writing to Les, as proof of adultery, so she won''t receive any recompense. Carl leaves, heading back to San Francisco, to begin divorce proceedings. 
Claire hatches a plan; she heads to the airport, where she finds a pilot - Blackie Talon, and tells him she needs to immediately fly round-trip to San Francisco and back. She pays him extra to ensure his silence.
The next morning, Claire phones Les, and tells him Carl''s flown to New York on business, and she''s planning to return to San Francisco, where she''ll spend the rest of her honeymoon with him. She asks Les to arrange a flight for her and to pick her up at the airport. After picking Claire up, she asks him to drive to Carl''s mansion, so she can get some clothes. 
Upon arriving, Les makes a gruesome discovery; Carl''s dead body, in an easy chair, a gun in his hand. Apparently, Carl killed himself. Les phones the police, though Claire seems unfazed. At the police station,  Claire''s questioned. The police think Carl''s death could not have been a suicide, as there are no fingerprints on the gun, nor powder burns on his hands. They suspect Claire, but she''s a strong alibi: she (falsely) states that she was in Los Angeles at the time of the murder, and has the plane ticket and Les to back her up.
Les and Claire rekindle their romance as if her whirlwind marriage and subsequent death of Carl Henneman never taken place. One night while out to dinner, Claire spots Stanley Mason, an attorney who''s currently running for congress. She asks Les about him, and brings up the idea of his handling Carl''s estate. Les tells her that Stanley is - in all probability - too busy with his campaign for congress. Ignoring Les, she approaches Stanley, and tells him she could use a good lawyer to handle her late husband''s estate. Stanley decides to help her, and in no time, the pair become lovers.
Les finds himself once again losing Claire to another man. At the same time, the police are coming down hard on Les, as he''s their primary suspect. Les realises there are too many holes in the theory of Carl''s supposed suicide, and confronts Claire, telling her, "[she''s] not like other women. [She''s] not warm. [She''s] cold, like ice. Blonde ice." That evening, the pilot, Blackie shows up, demading more money from Claire for his continued silence. Claire gives him some of her jewelry, and Blackie runs off. Later that night, Claire and Stanley are joined at dinner by psychologist Dr. Kippinger, who''s able to pick up on Claire machinations towards Stanley.
With the police having closed Carl''s murder case, for insufficient evidence, Claire''s able to relax again.  Just then, Blackie, the pilot reappears. Tired of dealing with him, Claire murders him and goes back to her new life with Stanley. At the victory party where Stanley announces  his election victory, he also  proclaims he''s going to marry Claire. Immediately after the announcement, Claire heads over to Les, and tells him not to worry, she still loves him. Like a repeat of her wedding to Carl, Stanley walks in on her kissing Les, and he immediately breaks off the engagement to Claire.
Unfortunately for him, no one leaves Claire: she murders Stanley, and tries to pin the murder on Les. The police come and arrest Les, but Dr. Kippinger knows the real murderer was Claire. He confronts her at her newspaper office, and discovers she has already written a confession for the murders of Carl, Blackie, and Stanley for an unknown reason. Claire decides to kill Dr. Kippinger before turning herself in, and tries to shoot the doctor. Instead, she accidentally shoots and kills herself.
In the final scene, a bunch of people come into her office and stare at her corpse.

('tt0012364','free','Körkarlen (1921)','1921','1h 40min','On New Year''s Eve, dying Salvation Army Sister Edit has one last wish: to speak with David Holm. David, a drunkard, is sitting in a graveyard, telling his two drinking buddies about his old friend Georges, who told him about the legend that the last person to die each year has to drive Death''s carriage and collect the souls of everybody who dies the following year. Georges himself died on New Year''s Eve the previous year.
Gustafsson, a colleague of Edit, finds David, but is unable to convince him to go see her. When his friends try to drag him there, a fight breaks out, and David is struck on the head with a bottle just before the clock strikes twelve. David''s soul emerges from his body as the carriage appears. The driver is Georges.
Georges reminds David of how the latter once lived a happy life with his wife Anna, their two children and his brother, until Georges led him astray. As shown in a flashback that follows, David was jailed for drunkenness. Before being released from prison, he was shown his brother, who had been sentenced to a long term for killing a man while drunk. When David went home, he found the apartment empty. Furious, he became determined to track Anna down and have his revenge.
During his search throughout Sweden, David arrives at a new Salvation Army Mission on New Year''s Eve. Maria does not want to answer the bell, as it is very late, but Edit lets him in. Despite his rudeness to her, she mends his coat while he sleeps. The next day, she asks him to return in one year; she had prayed that the first visitor would have good fortune for that period and wants to know the outcome of her prayer. He agrees, but before he leaves, he tears out her patches.
Georges informs David that the promise has to be fulfilled and takes him against his will in the carriage to Edit. In another flashback it is shown how Edit once found David in a bar with Gustafsson and another man. Edit persuaded the other man to go home with his wife and gave Gustafsson an advertisement for a Salvation Army meeting. At the meeting, Gustafsson submitted himself to God, but David remained completely unrepentant. Anna was at the meeting, but David did not recognize her. Later, Anna told Edit who she was, and Edit tried to effect a reconciliation. At first, the couple were optimistic, but soon David''s behavior drove Anna to despair once again. One night, Anna pleaded with him not to expose their children to his consumption (the same fatal disease Edit caught from him). When he refused, Anna locked him in the kitchen and tried to flee again with their children, but fainted. He broke through the door with an axe, but did not physically hurt her.
When Georges arrives in Edit''s room, she begs him to let her live until she sees David again. She thinks she is the one to blame for his magnified sins, as she brought the couple together again. When David hears this, he is deeply moved. He kisses her hands, and when Edit sees his regret, she can die in peace. Georges does not take her, saying others will come for her. He then shows David that Anna, afraid of leaving her children alone after she herself dies of consumption, is planning to poison them and herself. David begs Georges to do something, but Georges has no power over the living. Then David regains consciousness in the graveyard. He rushes to Anna before she can act. With great difficulty, he convinces her that he sincerely wishes to reform.','["Victor Sjöström"]','["Selma Lagerlöf","Victor Sjöström"]','["Victor Sjöström","Hilda Borgström","Tore Svennberg"]','["Drama","Fantasy","Horror"]','8.1','["tt0013257","tt0016847","tt0023649","tt0015064","tt0014972","tt0013086","tt0009968","tt0012532","tt0010323","tt0019585","tt0008663","tt0018528"]','["horror; romance; sweden;"]','[{"url":"/PhantomCarraige_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/PhantomCarriage.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/PhantomCarriage_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','PhantomCarraige',11614,'Q1193655','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

His first week off Don goes to see his girlfriend Kay and asks her to marry him, but she tells him she can''t, since she just married a merchant named Steve Downey. Crushed, Don returns to Dark Mountain.
Kay finds out that the man she married is a racketeer, operating on the black market. One day a government agent, Dave Lewis, arrives to investigate Steve''s business. He is killed by one of Steve''s goons, and the body dropped in the middle of the road, to make it look like he has been accidentally run over.
Kay decides to leave her husband, but he doesn''t let her go. She is present and witness to when Steve kills one of his own men that he suspects have told the police about the operation. Steve then flees and brings Kay with him. He tells her that she is a criminal too, being an accomplice in the racketeering since her name is on the contract for his warehouse.
When Steve decides they will split up to easier get away from the police, Kay goes to Don for protection and advice. He gives her shelter in one of the mountain cabins but tells her to go to police as soon as possible.
Steve manages to track Kay to the mountain cabin and tells Kay he will kill her if she reveals to anyone that he is there. Don brings Kay food every day, and soon realizes that she is not alone in the cabin.
Don and Willie plan a trap to catch Steve without risking to harm Kay. Over the short wave radio, they send a fake message that the police believe they are closing in on the fugitive near the Mexican border, to lure Steve out of hiding. Steve leaves the cabin, but he brings Kay with him again. He steals Don''s truck, full of explosives, and drives off. Willie''s dog catches up with the truck shortly after they leave and jumps in; he starts attacking Steve during the drive.
While the truck is still moving, Kay and the dog jump out through a door, and Willie flattens the tires with his gun. The truck goes off the road and explodes with Steve still in it. Kay throws herself in Don''s arms and they are reunited.','["William Berke"]','["Paul Franklin","Charles F.

After the four watch mating rituals of various animals set to strains of Camille Saint-Saëns''s "The Swan", they are welcomed into the Emerald City. Suits of armor sing to them, "Hail to the Wizard of Oz! To the Wizard of Oz we lead the way!" A creature resembling the A-B-Sea Serpent of The Royal Book of Oz extends itself as stairsteps for Dorothy to enter the coach.
The Wizard is a cackling white-bearded man in a starry black robe and conical hat who produces custom seats for each of the four nervous travelers, including one for Toto (the Toto chair is mostly cut out of the frame in most video versions, but is later shown in a full shot of Toto sitting). He proceeds to perform magic with a hen and eggs. These are variations on simple sleight of hand tricks involving making objects appear, but the hen is able to take the eggs back into her body.
Finally, the hen releases an egg that will not stop growing. The five try to fight it, with the Tin Woodman breaking his axe. Soon, though, the egg hatches, the hen takes the chick, and clucks out "Rock-a-bye Baby" as a chorus joins her.','["Ted Eshbaugh"]','["Frank Joslyn Baum","L.

All have had their blood drained through identical 10 cm incisions on the inside of each forearm. Miguel suspects a homicidal maniac but has heard rumours that a "strange blood cult" is to blame. Adam goes undercover as a writer seeking the story of the latest victim, Maria Cortez, a hostess at the Barrio Club, owned by Mr. Calderone (Vic Silayan).
Adam goes to the club. He brushes off a pretty hostess, Theresa (Judy Dennis), and instead watches beautiful blonde Serena (Nielson) dance. He and Calderone discuss the article about Maria.
That night, Adam kills a man who attacked him in his hotel room. Afterwards, he''s stopped by a seemingly homeless man who in reality is Herrera (Eddie Infante), an undercover officer with a prosthetic leg who is Adam''s police liaison.
Sylvia (Henryk), Miguel''s adopted sister, drives Adam into the countryside and dumps him there, accusing him of not taking the case seriously. As he walks to his hotel, he sees a drunken Theresa arrive home. Out of sight of Adam, she''s jumped by a humanoid monster. At the club, Serena suddenly clutches her face and runs off the dance floor. She looks older than she had earlier.
Miguel contacts the police in Lima and learns that Calderone and Serena fled Peru two years earlier, after Calderone was implicated in the murders of several young women. Elena, another club hostess, is then kidnapped by the monster.
Adam is unaware of the monster but suspects that Calderone is the murderer. Serena disingenuously tells Adam that Calderone "is a maniac and he''ll kill to protect his secret." She introduces Adam to Louisa, a new hostess. Louisa is actually Sylvia. She has fallen in love with Adam and wants to help him. She points out that Serena''s wrist-to-elbow armbands are of Aztec or Inca origin. 
The monster kills Elena in a secret chamber beneath the Barrio Club. He moves a bowl of her blood in front of Sylvia, who is seated in a chair with a brightly lit box behind her head. She throws powder into the blood. Smoke rises and when it clears Serena is young again.
Serena asks Adam to her home and tells him lies. She says that Calderone killed his wife and made it look like suicide, and that he forces her to dance at the club. Adam passes out from the drugged drink that Serena gave him. As this happens, Sylvia discovers the secret chamber and is grabbed by the monster.
Adam awakens tied to a tree. Serena explains that she was chosen "by her people" to become one of the "golden goddesses" but she must have the blood of other women to maintain her eternal beauty. The blood is mixed with the powdered roots of ancient trees and the "electrical energy of the sun harnessed in a small container." Serena removes an armband to show Adam her scar, identical to those of the murder victims. But just as she is about to stab Adam, she begins ageing rapidly and runs for the chamber.
Adam is freed by one of Calderone''s men and calls the police. Adam takes Miguel to the chamber, where the monster is about to kill Sylvia. Instead, he attacks the men, inadvertently moving the bowl of Elena''s blood in front of Serena. Miguel shoots the monster four times to little effect. The monster begins strangling both men, but Herrera hits him with his artificial leg. The monster falls and strikes his head. Adam and Miguel save Sylvia. 
Serena throws powder into Elena''s blood. When the smoke clears, she is a very old woman. She throws another handful and after the smoke dissipates only her clothing and armbands remain. The monster dies, revealing himself to be Calderone.
The case solved, Adam kisses Sylvia good-bye and heads home to New York.','["Newt Arnold"]',NULL,'["Robert Winston","Katherine Henryk","Yvonne Nielson"]','[""]','4.5','["tt0056056","tt0066816","tt0055902","tt0038531","tt0067169","tt0051536","tt0065887","tt0070270","tt0092675","tt0062036","tt0075001","tt0073801"]','["horror;witchcraft;feature films"]','[{"url":"/BloodThirst1971.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/BloodThirst1971_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/BloodThirst1971_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','BloodThirst1971',29083,'Q4927725','wp','["N.I.P.

The Bat, a figure dressed as a bat, murders Gideon and steals the emeralds. The Bat leaves a bat-shaped note for the chief of police to inform him that he will be traveling to the country. The Bat travels by car to a mansion built by Courtleigh Fleming, the president of the Oakdale Bank, who has recently been found dead in Colorado. The mansion is being rented for the summer by writer Cornelia Van Gorder, whose maid, Lizzie Allen, sets up a bear trap to catch the Bat. Richard Fleming, Courtleigh''s spendthrift nephew, wishes to lease the mansion, and plans with Dr. H. E. Wells to frighten Van Gorder away.
The newspaper reports that Brooks Bailey, a cashier at Oakdale Bank, has robbed the bank of $200,000 and has disappeared. Van Gorder''s niece, Miss Dale Ogden, arrives with a supposed new gardener. Van Gorder asks the gardener about his knowledge on alopecia, urticaria, and rubeola, and he answers as if the terms referred to plants rather than medical conditions. On the staircase, Richard is shot, and Miss Dale manages to snatch part of a blueprint of the house from his pocket. Detective Moletti accuses her of trying to find a supposed hidden room in the mansion that should be shown on the blueprint. Detective Anderson arrives, and the group gets a call from the house phone in the garage, which sounds like groans of distress. A circular light shines on the wall, with the shadow of a bat in its center, but after investigating, the group finds that the shape was caused by a miller moth on a car headlight.
Dr. Wells has Miss Dale recreate Richard''s murder, and she notes that she tucked the blueprint in a Parker House roll on a tray, but the blueprint is now gone. The new gardener is revealed to be Brooks Bailey, and Anderson attempts to arrest him for robbery, murder, and impersonation, but Miss Dale stops him, revealing that she and Brooks are engaged. Dr. Wells searches for the hidden room by knocking on walls, which causes the others to investigate the sound, leading them to a ballroom which is supposedly haunted. The candles in the ballroom go out when lit, and a shape appears to float towards Anderson and Lizzie, but it turns out to be the Japanese butler Billy carrying a lamp. After being confronted by Moletti, Dr. Wells knocks Moletti unconscious by striking his head, and he hides Moletti''s body in another room. A beaten man enters the house, and Anderson finds that he has no identification on his person.
Billy sees a mysterious figure wearing a hat, and as he leaves to tell the others, the Bat''s shadow passes by the door. The Bat sets up a system of wires that attach to a light switch. Outside, Brooks sees the figure in the hat crossing the roof, and realizes that it is the supposedly dead Courtleigh Fleming. Miss Dale finds the hidden room, located behind a fireplace. The Bat confronts her, demanding the combination to the safe in the hidden room, but she escapes. Dr. Wells is accused of helping the Bat, and the Bat is soon captured and held at gunpoint. However, the Bat activates the wire system, turning off the lights and allowing himself to escape. The Bat flees outside but his leg is caught in the bear trap placed earlier by Lizzie. The others find him and remove his mask, revealing him to be Moletti. The beaten, unknown man announces that he is the true Detective Moletti, and that the man underneath the Bat''s mask was merely an impersonator of Moletti.','["Roland West"]','["Avery Hopwood","Julien Josephson"]','["George Beranger","Charles Herzinger","Emily Fitzroy"]','["Mystery","Thriller"]','6.6','["tt0052602","tt0020668","tt0017739","tt0019130","tt0081975","tt0109302","tt0027194","tt0058544","tt0058379","tt3627704","tt0060440","tt0059346"]','["The Bat;1926;Silent Film;Horror;Mystery;Batman;Batsignal Roland West;Robber;Masked;Criminal; Vigilante;"]','[{"url":"/TheBat1926.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/TheBat1926_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/TheBat1926_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','TheBat1926',18883,'Q2485195','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

('tt0011193','free','The Flapper (1920)','1920','1h 28min','Sixteen-year-old Genevieve ''Ginger'' King (Thomas) is living in a very wealthy family in the boring town of Orange Springs, Florida, where even having a soda with a boy is considered scandalous. Because of her questionable behavior and yearning for a thrilling life, Ginger’s father decides to send her to a boarding school, Mrs. Paddles’ School for Young Ladies, which is administered by strict disciplinarian Mrs. Paddles (Marcia Harris) in Lake Placid, New York.
Despite the strictness there, the girls have fun getting into flapper-lifestyle trouble including flirting. Richard Channing (William P. Carleton), an older man, rides past the seminary every day, prompting romantic fantasies among the schoolgirls. When Ginger connives a sleigh ride with Channing, she lies to him about her age, saying she is "about twenty". Ginger is quickly charmed and becomes enamored with him. Ginger soon gets into trouble with the headmistress by sneaking out to the local country club where Channing is having a party. One of her schoolmates, Hortense (Katherine Johnston), who is described as “a moth among the butterfies”, informs on her. Hortense’s actual motive for doing this is to get the headmistress out of the way so she can rob the school''s safe and flee with her crooked boyfriend Thomas Morran (Arthur Housman). Acting on a vaguely worded note she receives, Ginger—while traveling home from school—goes to a hotel in New York City where Hortense and Thomas are staying. They force her to take some suitcases for safekeeping, cases that contain stolen valuables, including fancy clothes and jewelry.
Knowing that Channing has gone to Orange Springs on a yachting trip, Ginger decides to use the clothes and jewels to present herself as a more-mature, well-dressed “woman of experience” when she returns home. Her plan backfires, and her father believes she is lying when she says it is all a joke. Detectives then show up wanting to know why she has stolen loot; and both her young admirer Bill and Channing think she has really become a wicked woman. Hortense and her crooked boyfriend now turn up in Orange Springs to reclaim their illgotten loot. Their subsequent capture by the police clears Ginger''s name and restores her reputation.
The events in the lives of Ginger King and another character are presented as incidents in a (non-fiction) newsreel at the end of the movie.','["Alan Crosland"]','["Frances Marion","Frances Marion"]','["Olive Thomas","Theodore Westman Jr.","William P.

('tt0029445','free','Public Cowboy No. 1 (1937)','1937','1h 1min','A rash of strange cattle rustlings have occurred in which cattle are slaughtered on the range and their carcasses taken away. Sheriff Matt Doniphon (William Farnum) and his deputies, Gene Autry (Gene Autry) and Frog Millhouse (Smiley Burnette), watch over one rancher''s cattle as they are driven to Box Canyon. After the sheriff and his men leave, the rustlers move in, radio the cattle''s location from an airplane, and then bring in refrigerator trucks. The rancher and one of his workers are murdered, the cattle killed, and the carcasses taken away.
Newspaper editor Helen Morgan (Ann Rutherford), responding to the increased cattle raids, demands that Sheriff Doniphon be replaced, claiming he is too old-fashioned to deal with modern rustlers. Gene defends the sheriff against Helen''s editorial. Having been raised by the sheriff after being orphaned by outlaws as a young boy, Gene knows the man''s character and abilities. Helen, however, refuses to change her stance.
While investigating the recent raids, Gene and Frog grow suspicious of the Chicago and Western Packing Co., owned by Jack Shannon (Arthur Loft) and run by Jack and his brother Jim (House Peters Jr.). The deputies find the carcasses of some rustled cattle and demand to see the hides in order to check the brands. Lying to the deputies, Jim tells them that the cattle belong to his partner, Thad Slaughter (Maston Williams), and that Slaughter has the hides at his ranch.
On their way to Slaughter''s ranch, Gene and Sheriff Doniphon discover Frog locked in one of Jim''s trucks. They chase after the truck and Jim shoots the sheriff, who is not seriously wounded. Later that afternoon, Frog identifies Jim as the one who shot the sheriff. Jim is taken to jail, and Jack and Slaughter grow concerned that Jim may talk and expose their operation. That night, Slaughter summons Jim to the jail window and beats Jim to death.
The next day, many of the town''s citizens demand that Sheriff Doniphon resign, blaming him for the murder and the ongoing cattle raids. Eustace P. Quackenbush (James C. Morton) and his uniformed private detectives are soon hired to put an end to the raids and restore order with their modern, scientific methods. At the welcoming party, Jack learns that rancher Bidwell''s men are all in town and alerts his rustlers to go to Bidwell''s ranch, where Frog and Stubby (Frankie Marvin) lay in wait for the desperados, wearing a cow costume. When he sees the rustlers approaching, Frog sends an emergency message to Gene, who then uses the radio to call all local cowboys to defend Bidwell''s ranch against the rustlers. Hearing the broadcast, the rustlers attempt to flee. Frog and Stubby also have to flee from an amorous bull.
Meanwhile, on their way to the Bidwell ranch, the automobiles and motorcycles used by Quackenbush and his detectives get stuck in the mud, while the cowboys ride past the detectives on their trusty horses and quickly round up the gang. Sheriff Doniphon shoots Jack as he attempts to use Helen as a hostage, thereby proving to her that old-fashioned methods are still the best. While Frog and Stubby try to outrun a bull attracted by their cow costume, Gene and Helen ride back to town together, passing Quackenbush and his detectives who are still stuck in the mud and suffering from the effects of their tear gas grenades that have accidentally detonated.','["Joseph Kane"]','["Oliver Drake","Bernard McConville"]','["Gene Autry","Smiley Burnette","Ann Rutherford"]','[""]','5.6','["tt0025303","tt0026867","tt0029209","tt0030409","tt0026697","tt0028054","tt0029334","tt0028163","tt0027361"]','["Western; Gene Autry"]','[{"url":"/PublicCowboyNo.1.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/PublicCowboyNo.1_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/PublicCowboyNo.1_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','PublicCowboyNo.1',7128,'Q7257351','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Comte Philippe de Chagny (John St. Polis) and his brother, the Vicomte Raoul de Chagny (Norman Kerry) are in attendance. Raoul attends only in the hope of hearing his sweetheart Christine Daaé (Mary Philbin) sing. Christine has made a sudden rise from the chorus to understudy of Mme. Carlotta, the prima donna. Raoul visits her in her dressing room during the performance, and makes his intentions known that he wishes for Christine to resign and marry him.  Christine refuses to let their relationship get in the way of her career.
At the height of the most prosperous season in the Opera''s history, the management suddenly resign. As they leave, they tell the new managers of the Opera Ghost, a phantom who asks for opera box No. 5, among other things. The new managers laugh it off as a joke, but the old management leaves troubled.
After the performance, the ballerinas are disturbed by the sight of a mysterious man in a fez (Arthur Edmund Carewe), who dwells in the cellars. Arguing whether or not he is the Phantom, they decide to ask Joseph Buquet, a stagehand who has actually seen the ghost''s face. Buquet describes a ghastly sight of a living skeleton to the girls, who are then startled by a shadow cast on the wall. The antics of stagehand Florine Papillon (Snitz Edwards) do not amuse Joseph''s brother, Simon (Gibson Gowland), who chases him off.  Meanwhile, Mme. Carlotta (Virginia Pearson), the prima donna of the Paris Grand Opera, barges into the managers'' office enraged. She has received a letter from "The Phantom," demanding that Christine sing the role of Marguerite the following night, threatening dire consequences if his demands are not met.  Christine is in her dressing room at that moment, speaking to a phantom voice (which the audience sees as a shadow on a wall behind the dressing room.) The voice warns her that she will take Carlotta''s place on Wednesday and that she is to think only of her career and her master.
The following day, in a garden near the Opera House, Raoul meets Christine and asks her to reconsider his offer.  Christine admits that she has been tutored by a divine voice, the "Spirit of Music," and that it is now impossible to stop her career.  Raoul tells her that he thinks someone is playing a joke on her, and she storms off in anger.
Wednesday evening, Carlotta is ill and Christine takes her place in the opera. During the performance, the managers go to Box 5 to see exactly who has taken it. The keeper of the box does not know who it is, as she has never seen his face. The two managers enter the box and are startled to see a shadowy figure seated there. They run out of the box and compose themselves, but when they enter the box again, the person is gone. In her next performance, Christine reaches her triumph during the finale and receives a standing ovation from the audience. When Raoul visits her in her dressing room, she pretends not to recognize him, because unbeknownst to those in the room, the phantom voice is present. Meanwhile, Simon Buquet finds the body of his brother, Joseph, hanging by the strangler''s noose and vows vengeance. Raoul spends the evening outside her door, and after the others have left, just as he is about to enter, he hears the voice within the room. He overhears the voice make his intentions to Christine: "Soon, Christine, this spirit will take form and will demand your love!" When Christine leaves her room alone, Raoul breaks in to find it empty. Carlotta receives another discordant note from the Phantom. Once again, it demands that she take ill and let Christine have her part. The managers also get a note, reiterating that if Christine does not sing, they will present "Faust" in a house with a curse on it.

The following evening, despite the Phantom''s warnings, a defiant Carlotta appears as Marguerite.  At first, the performance goes well, but soon the Phantom''s curse takes its effect, backstage, causing the great crystal chandelier to fall down onto the audience. Christine runs to her dressing room and is entranced by a mysterious voice through a secret door behind the mirror, descending, in a dream-like sequence, semi-conscious on horseback by a winding staircase into the lower depths of the Opera. She is then taken by gondola over a subterranean lake by the masked Phantom into his lair. The Phantom introduces himself as Erik and declares his love; Christine faints, so Erik carries her to a suite fabricated for her comfort. The next day, when she awakens, she finds a note from Erik telling her that she is free to come and go as she pleases, but that she must never look behind his mask. In the next room, the Phantom is playing his composition, "Don Juan Triumphant." Christine''s curiosity gets the better of her, and she sneaks up behind the Phantom and tears off his mask, revealing his hideously deformed face. Enraged, the Phantom makes his plans to hold her prisoner known. In an attempt to plead to him, he excuses her to visit her world one last time, with the condition that she never sees her lover again.
Released from the underground dungeon, Christine makes a rendezvous at the annual masked-ball, which is graced with the Phantom in the guise of the ''Red-Death'' from the Edgar Allan Poe short story of the same name. Raoul finds Christine and they flee to the roof of the Opera House, where she tells him everything that followed the chandelier crash. However, an unseen jealous Phantom perching on the statue of Apollo overhears them. Raoul plans to whisk Christine safely away to London following the next performance.  As they leave the roof, the mysterious man with the fez approaches them.  Aware that the Phantom is waiting downstairs, he leads Christine and Raoul to another exit.
The following evening, Raoul meets Christine in her dressing room.  She has heard the voice of the Phantom, who has revealed that he knows their plans.  Raoul has arranged for a carriage and reassures her nothing will go wrong. During the performance, the Phantom kidnaps Christine off the stage during a blackout. Raoul rushes to Christine''s dressing room, and meets the man in the fez, who reveals himself to be Inspector Ledoux, a secret policeman who has been studying Erik''s moves as the Phantom since he escaped as a prisoner from Devil''s Island.  Ledoux reveals the secret door in Christine''s room and the two men enter the catacombs of the Opera House in an attempt to rescue Christine.  Instead, they fall into the Phantom''s dungeon, a torture room of his design.  Philippe has also found his way into the catacombs looking for his brother, and a clanging alarm alerts the Phantom to his presence in a canoe on the lake.  Phillipe is drowned by Erik, who returns to find the two men in the torture chamber.  Turning a switch, the Phantom subjects the two prisoners to intense heat; the two manage to escape the chamber by opening a door in the floor as they are about to perish. In the chamber below, the Phantom shuts a gate, locking them in with barrels full of gunpowder.
The Phantom gives Christine a choice of two levers: one shaped like a scorpion and the other like a grasshopper. One of them will save Raoul''s life, but at the cost of Christine marrying Erik, while the other will blow up the barrels in the chamber Raoul and Ledoux are trapped in, in effect destroying the Opera House and killing them all. Christine picks the scorpion, but it is a trick by the Phantom to "save" Raoul and Ledoux from being killed by drowning them. Christine begs the Phantom to save Raoul, promising him anything in return, even becoming his wife. At the last second, the Phantom opens a trapdoor in his floor through which Raoul and Ledoux are saved.
A mob, led by Simon, infiltrates the Phantom''s lair.  As the clanging alarm sounds and the mob approaches, the Phantom attempts to flee with Christine in the carriage meant for Raoul and Christine. While Raoul saves Christine, the Phantom is pursued and killed by a mob, who throw him into the River Seine to finally drown. In a brief epilogue, Raoul and Christine are shown on their honeymoon in Viroflay.',NULL,NULL,'["Lon Chaney","Mary Philbin","Norman Kerry"]','["Horror"]','7.6','["tt0036261","tt0014142","tt0034398","tt0021814","tt0023245","tt0021884","tt0026138","tt0024184","tt0013442","tt0046876","tt0010323","tt0031951"]','["Silent Film; Lon Chaney; The Phantom of the Opera; 1925; Universal"]','[{"url":"/ThePhantomOfTheOpera1925NewYorkGeneralReleasePrint_620_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/ThePhantomOfTheOpera1925PublicDomainScore_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','ThePhantomOfTheOpera1925NewYorkGeneralReleasePrint_620',18494,'Q927919','wp','["Gaston Leroux"]','["Rupert Julian","Lon Chaney"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The father (Charles Insley) is awakened when a pretty girl (Margie Reiger) trips over his outstretched feet.  The father is an incorrigible womanizer and immediately follows the girl to another park bench while his wife (Marta Golden) and adult daughter (Edna Purviance) remain asleep.  He briefly departs to buy himself and the girl drinks from a refreshment stand.  As soon as he leaves, Charlie arrives at the park bench where the pretty girl is seated.  Charlie attempts to flirt with her—and the girl seems to enjoy his company.  The father returns with two bottled drinks and jealously smashes one over Charlie''s head, knocking him senseless.  The father escorts the girl away.  The girl tells the father she wants to play hide-and-seek.  He agrees.  She blindfolds him and walks away.  Charlie regains his senses and comes across the blindfolded father.  He leads him to the edge of a pond with his cane.  The father removes his blindfold moments before Charlie kicks him into the water.  (A passing park policeman who tries to intervene gets kicked into the pond too.)  Charlie comes across the father''s wife and daughter and makes a favorable impression.  They invite him to their house for refreshments.  Meanwhile, the father befriends another man in the park whom Charlie has earlier annoyed (Billy Armstrong).  Together they go to the father''s home.  When snacks are put on the table, Charlie demonstrates a unique way of serving doughnuts and is having a merry time when the father sees him.  The other man, who is flirting with the father''s wife in the kitchen, sees Charlie too.  Both men try to corral Charlie, but he knocks them cold—but not before his trousers are ripped off his body.  Charlie initially runs into the street without any pants, but the commotion he creates outside causes him to retreat back into the house.  Charlie goes to an upstairs room where he conveniently sees a woman''s dress suit on a mannequin.  He changes into it and is seen in a hallway by the daughter.  Instead of being angry, the daughter laughs at the spectacle and suggests Charlie continue with the charade of dressing as a female to fool her flirtatious father.  She even offers him a pair of female shoes and a place to shave his mustache.  The female Charlie is introduced as a college chum of the daughter, and succeeds in attracting the attention of both the father and his friend.  The father resents the competition and angrily knocks his friend out of the house.  Charlie''s true gender is eventually revealed, however, when his skirt falls off.  Another fight ensues.  Charlie and the father seem to have made peace, but the father reacts angrily when Charlie wants to court his daughter.  Charlie is thrown out of the house and lands alongside the other man where another battle begins.','["Charles Chaplin"]',NULL,'["Charles Chaplin","Billy Armstrong","Marta Golden"]','[""]','6.5','["tt0006032","tt0006313","tt0005812","tt0004936","tt0005044","tt0005810","tt0005489","tt0005571","tt0005077","tt0007194","tt0005542","tt0007507"]','["Charlie Chaplin","Edna Purviance","silent film","silent movie stars","free classic film","old movies","silent film streaming","silent era","archive films","rare films","silent comedy","silent classics","classic images","classic comedy movies","classic films on line","classic movies on line","silent films on line","silent movies on line","good silent movies","old movies online","free classic movie","fine old movie"]','[{"url":"/A-Woman-v2.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/AWoman1915_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','AWoman1915',12005,'Q2449461','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

('tt0008112','free','His Wedding Night (1917)','1917','19min','Arbuckle plays a drug store clerk, soda jerk, and gas station attendant, who can be both lazy and dishonest. After he mixes a soda for one customer with elaborate gestures and juggling of utensils, he attends the perfume counter, where another customer has been indulging herself with a free sample. After he confronts her, he is distracted while an African American customer steps up to the counter. When the clerk hugs her and then realizes it is a different customer, he almost faints. Later on, while still on the job, he proposes to his boss''s daughter Alice (Alice Mann), and she gleefully accepts. The scene then switches to the gas pump, where Arbuckle''s character switches the sign to a higher price when a person with an expensive car drives up. After the car drives away, he drinks from the pump. Meanwhile inside, Al (Al St. John), another admirer of Alice, also proposes to her while they are eating watermelon. When she is tells him she is already engaged to the clerk, Al becomes outraged and begins causing a commotion in the store. After a food fight that involves several customers, the owner of the store throws Al out. Later in the day a delivery boy (Buster Keaton), after a prat fall over a bicycle rack, delivers Alice''s wedding dress to her room above the store. He agrees to model it for her so she can see how it looks. When a male customer enters and annoys the clerk, he puts chloroform in the sample bottle to knock him out if he comes in again. The male customer never returns, but several female customers end up knocking themselves out. When a pretty woman arrives, Fatty deliberately knocks her unconscious so he can kiss her. He knocks out his boss, who could be a witness, as well. After he sees another customer sampling the perfume, he is shocked when it has no effect on her, even when she drinks it. He investigates by spraying himself with the "perfume" but is himself knocked out. With Arbuckle''s character unconscious, Al, the rejected lover, sneaks into the store with his gang and kidnaps the delivery boy, thinking it is Alice, since his face is covered by a wedding veil. They tie him up and put a sack over his head and, escaping out of the second story window, take the delivery boy by to the justice of the peace''s office. There they attempt to force the justice of peace to marry them at gunpoint. However, the clerk regains consciousness and, thinking the group has actually kidnapped Alice, pursues the group, but only after he comically struggles with a mule that he wants to hook to a wagon. He thwarts the gang just in time. He then convinces the justice of the peace to marry him to the delivery boy, who, since his head is still covered in the sack, he thinks is Alice. Alice, discovering what has happened, gets on a bicycle and heads to the justice of the peace''s office as well. She arrives in time to stop the clerk from marrying the delivery boy. The clerk then throws the delivery boy into the room with Al and his henchmen. While that scene of slapstick fighting goes on in that room, the clerk and Alice must have been married, for in the final scene the clerk pays the justice of the peace but then sprays him with the chloroform in the perfume bottle and takes his money back. The film ends long before the newly wed couple reach their wedding night, as the title might have suggested would be forthcoming.','["Roscoe ''Fatty'' Arbuckle"]','["Roscoe ''Fatty'' Arbuckle","Joseph Anthony Roach"]','["Roscoe ''Fatty'' Arbuckle","Buster Keaton","Al St. John"]','[""]','6.0','["tt0007761","tt0008377","tt0007819","tt0008523","tt0009466","tt0008874","tt0008975","tt0009123","tt0010221","tt0009899","tt0011071","tt0012253"]','["Fatty Arbuckle; Buster Keaton; Al St John; silent; silents"]','[{"url":"/HisWeddingNight_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/HisWeddingNight_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','HisWeddingNight',11453,'Q3211094','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

YOU MUST NOT MISS
GERTRUDE McSKINNY
FAMOUS STAR WHO WILL 
PLAY THE LITTLE LAUNDRESS 
FIRST TIME HERE 
TOMORROW AT 2PM
But upon returning inside the theatre he unwittingly leaves the door open so it obscures the left side of the sign and appears to read:
MISS SKINNY WILL UNDRESS HERE AT 2PM
The evening''s entertainment arrives, first an extremely flexible dancer whom Fatty and Keaton feebly attempt to mimic. Next, a tall and egotistical, strongman who badly mistreats his assistant (Mahone). The staff attempt to defend the assistant but the strongman is so powerful that he is able to blow Fatty away using only his breath and does not even flinch when Keaton repeatedly hits him over the head with an axe. Eventually the staff manage to subdue the strongman by challenging him to prove his immense strength by lifting a heavy weight then electrocuting him.
That night the theater is completely full (due to the partially obscured sign) but due to his treatment earlier the strongman quits and takes the dancer with him forcing Fatty, Keaton and the assistant to plan an operetta, which they title "The Falling Reign", at short notice. Fatty and Keaton dress in drag and perform an elaborate dance act. The dancer who quit earlier is in the audience and frequently heckles the show but is soon dispatched when Keaton''s dancing proves to energetic and launches him into the audience knocking the dancer out. The second act is a routine in which Fatty and Keaton are being covered with fake snow but the theater is so hot that Keaton has to fan himself and take off his coat, ruining the illusion. Things are made worse when the man slowly releasing the fake snow accidentally drops the whole bag onto Fatty, and during a scene where Fatty is serenading the assistant who sits in the window of the facade of a house, Keaton accidentally bumps into it knocking it over and causing it to fall towards Fatty but the open window fits neatly around his body saving him from harm.
Despite the show being a disaster, the audience nevertheless applaud and roar with laughter, believing the performers fumbles to be part of the act. The strongman, sitting in the audience, is outraged that his assistant is now a success. He produces a gun and shoots her before starting a brawl with the entire stage team. As Keaton and St John keep the strongman busy, Fatty loads a trunk full of weights and drops it on the strongman''s head, knocking him out.
The short ends with Fatty visiting the assistant in the hospital who is recovering well.','["Roscoe ''Fatty'' Arbuckle"]',NULL,'["Roscoe ''Fatty'' Arbuckle","Buster Keaton","Al St. John"]','[""]','6.6','["tt0010155","tt0010221","tt0008874","tt0009123","tt0008975","tt0009466","tt0007819","tt0008377","tt0008112","tt0011071","tt0007761","tt0009389"]','["silent ; comedy; arbuckle; Norman; theater"]','[{"url":"/Backstage_928_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/backstage.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/backstage_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','Backstage_928',19546,'Q3933794','wp','["Jean C.

Kildare has not proposed to Mary because of his poor financial situation as an intern. Kildare''s mentor, Dr. Leonard Gillespie, is informed that Paul Messenger, whose daughter Kildare cured in The Secret of Dr. Kildare, has arranged for Kildare to be offered a prestigious, lucrative position with the Messenger Institute. In the meantime Kildare has arranged for his inspiring but crusty mentor to see a cancer specialist about the melanoma Gillespie is battling.
Despite the temptation of a high salary and a new home, Kildare turns down the job offer to continue to remain near Gillespie. As a result, Mary gives up all hope of marrying Kildare and is assigned as a staff surgical nurse to Lane. Kildare and Lane are put together on a case involving an unidentified patient with a skull fracture who is refusing the operation that would save his life. Lane knows the patient urgently needs the surgery but has lost confidence in himself because too many of his patients have died on the operating table. Kildare convinces Lane that Gillespie has full confidence in his skills and Lane proceeds with the operation. 
When the patient wakes up, he shows clear signs of insanity, putting Lane''s career in jeopardy and subject to criminal prosecution. Kildare is convinced that the man was mentally ill before the accident which fractured his skull, and thus Lane had a legal right to perform the operation. He risks his own career by using a new treatment, the "insulin shock cure," which succeeds. Questioning the patient for his identity and background, Kildare finds the man''s estranged wife and learns that he had gradually lost his sanity over a five-year separation. 
Mary puts her own career on the line to protect Kildare until he returns with the wife. Gillespie fires Kildare to get him to propose to Mary. Seeing the couple reunited, she accepts, even knowing that their engagement will of necessity be a protracted one. Gillespie reveals that once again he has plotted to have Kildare find his own way through a difficult situation. Turning the tables, Kildare extracts a promise from Gillespie to accept the care of the cancer specialist in return for keeping Kildare on as his assistant.','["Harold S.

('tt0022628','free','The Animal Kingdom (1932)','1932','1h 25min','Tom Collier (Leslie Howard) is the owner of Bantam Press, a publisher of important and meaningful (but not wildly popular) books and a printer and binder of volumes that represent the best of the bookbinder''s art. He and the men who work in his press and bindery find great satisfaction in their work but neither avocation has made Tom rich or successful in his father''s eyes. For three years, he has been living with his best friend and longtime lover Daisy Sage (Ann Harding), without being married. (Tom jokes that one of the reasons he has resisted the idea of marriage is because he “was exposed to a bad case of it as a baby,” presumably a reference to his parents’ unhappiness.) Daisy is a successful commercial artist for a fashion magazine. She has just returned from three months in Paris.
Waiting in Tom''s Connecticut house to have dinner with a long-overdue Tom, attended by Tom''s quirky ex- boxer manservant Red Regan (William Gargan ), his wealthy banker father, Rufus Collier (Henry Stephenson), describes his lifelong frustration with his son to Cecelia “Cee” Henry (Myrna Loy) and Owen Fiske (Neil Hamilton), a family friend and attorney. Tom has had every advantage, including education at both Harvard and Oxford, and a position at the bank. His father is now afraid that Tom might actually marry Daisy.  Cee reassures him on that score: She is going to marry Tom in June. Owen is surprised and crushed (he thought that she loved him) but Tom''s father doesn''t notice and approves wholeheartedly.
Tom arrives at last, two  hours late. A radiogram from Daisy indicates that she is already home. In private, he explains to Cee about Daisy and their queer sort of arrangement, ”free as air.” Among other things, she made him a better person, and Daisy was the first to realize that they haven''t been “in love” for a long while. It is important that she be told immediately, so Tom is going back to town. Rufus is incensed, but Cee is all understanding, to the mystification of his father.
Daisy welcomes Tom to her apartment overlooking the East River, bursting with joy. Two exciting things happened while she was away. She  now believes that if she works hard enough, she can “really” paint. She is counting on his advice, and wants Tom to go to Mexico with her for a month, in June. The second thing: She fell in love with a little boy on the boat back from Europe. It made her realize: She is still deeply in love with Tom; she was a fool to refuse all his proposals; she wants his child. She reads “something terrible” in his face.
Tom tries to tell her about Cecelia. He can''t really explain the experience-he has known her less than a month. They are not lovers. Daisy, growing angry now, says “Good-Bye...’til Doomsday.” Tom is dazed and confused; he thought they could still be friends. While Daisy looks for a packet of his shirts in the bedroom, talking about how they might have a goodbye ceremony, he slowly walks out of the apartment.
A snowy winter day in New York, at least two years later: Tom pauses at a gallery to read the announcement of the first showing of Daisy''s work. That Saturday evening in the Connecticut house, Cee and her friend Grace (Ilka Chase) are having after-dinner coffee. It soon becomes clear that things have changed. Cee and Tom are supposedly going into town, to Daisy''s first showing, but Cee has plans to stop that. She accepts Grace''s latest invitation to one of her Sunday breakfasts, although Tom has assiduously avoided them, as he has his father''s invitations to dine with him and spend the night in town.  Cee  has persuaded Tom to publish a book that is “the worst tripe” that Bantam ever published, but sells wonderfully. Red comes home tipsy, and Cee confides to Grace that Tom is going to fire him.
Cee asks Tom about his old friends. He hasn''t seen them, and Daisy refuses to talk to him. Cee fakes a headache, and suggests Tom send a telegraph instead.  Her strategy doesn''t work; when she realizes that Tom will just go to the showing anyway, she goes upstairs to change. Her plot to get rid of Red doesn''t come off quite as planned—Red is plastered (on his day off) because he has been trying to tell Tom for a week that he has an offer of a job running a country gym with a bar attached. Tom is overjoyed for Red but downcast at losing his friend. Cee comes downstairs in the negligee she wore on their honeymoon in Quebec, and Tom is soon more than willing to skip the opening and come upstairs. She changes her tune yet again and tells him to go on, without her. He stays and sends a telegram instead.
Tom sees Daisy''s exhibition later and shows up uninvited at her apartment, where she and her girlfriend and neighbor, cellist Franc Schmidt (Leni Stengel ) are reading reviews. He receives a cold reception, which warms up when he gives her honest—and insightful—criticism of her work. She is painting too fast, as if she still had a magazine deadline to meet (she quit her job the year before.) They fall into their old way of talking and arguing, and at last confess to missing each other terribly. He says they need each other and she agrees that they can be friends, but with no secrets from the world—and they aren’t in love anymore. They kiss briefly, and Tom asks her for lunch the next day, then overflows with joy, pours out a list of dates for the whole week, ending with that  very night at 10 to 5 pm. They kiss, and he leaves. Daisy snaps out of it and frantically runs across the hall to  get Franc to help her pack. She is terrified. She loves him more than ever and is running away. Weeping, she asks Franc to take a painting he admired to him and to kiss him for her.
Months later, Tom''s father arrives at the Connecticut house.  He wants Cee to persuade Tom to move into town and live with him for the winter, and he wants her to plan a surprise birthday party and invite all of Tom''s old friends so Tom can see how he has outgrown them.  Cee also promises her father-in-law she will find a way to get rid of Red, who is back: He was sick and down on his luck, and Tom rescued him.
Cee calls Daisy and invites her, Franc and novelist Joe Fiske( Don Dillaway), Owen''s younger brother, to the party and to spend the night. Daisy, back from Nova Scotia, tries to stay away, but can''t believe Tom is happy. She loves him deeply and is heartsick  She wants to find out the truth, and calls Cee back to accepts the invitation.
At the party, Red is passing small brandies to the guests and reserving a large glass for Tom. He tells Daisy the party isn''t much fun, and when he tries to listen to the fight on the radio, Tom, who is already drunk, tells him to act like a butler. Daisy is reading the galleys for the “ latest rotten egg “ to be laid by the Bantam Press. Apparently all Tom cares about is money; Joe tells her that Tom might hook up with the infamous Williams and Warren, publishers of tawdry mass- produced romances.  Fiske also tells Daisy he spent a long time talking to Cee and she seems an attractive woman. “So was Delilah,” Daisy replies.
Meanwhile, Cee tells Owen that she is no longer jealous of Daisy, and adds the lie that Daisy has been seducing Joe. She uses Owen''s attraction to her to get him to persuade Tom to sell out, even though it is a violation of ethics and a conflict of interest, because Owen is counsel to Williams and Warren. When he agrees to help, she calls him darling, but their kiss is interrupted by Daisy. Cee tells her the good news about the sale.
Daisy, Franc and Joe pack and leave early. Joe doesn''t really get it; Franc can see that Daisy is now desperate to get away. There are superficially civilized farewells with Cee.  Daisy tells a shamefaced and astonished Tom that she pities him with all her heart and that she found out what she needed to know. He asks “What?” and grips her wrists so hard that she has to ask him to let go. She doesn''t answer his question. They leave, this time they both say “goodbye.” Tom''s father is the last to leave the party.
On the night of the birthday party, Cee locks Tom out of her bedroom, angry because he won''t promise to do any of the things she wants.
The next evening, she changes her tactics. Tom returns home from work and tells Cecelia that the sale of his business is all but complete—he only needs to sign the contract in front of a notary in the morning. He then speaks of having a child, and Cee''s face, unseen by him, turns to stone. They meet in her sitting room, where she has supper ready, with champagne to toast their future. Throughout the scene, the audience can see what Cecelia cannot: Tom''s reactions.
Tom muses aloud that Cecelia''s sitting room reminds him of someplace, he can''t quite think where. He remembers—a private room at The Florentine, run by Flora Conover, a sort of hotel, once the best place in London, 20 guineas on the mantelpiece in advance, the lady most artful... At the last, Cee recognizes that he is talking about a brothel and will hear no more.
Angry and hurt, Tom demands to know why she locked him out the night before. She says it was because he was so “disagreeable,” particularly when it came to his father''s wishes that they come and live with him. She asks about his father''s birthday gift. He can''t decide whether to send it back or just not cash it. She doesn''t understand why Tom won''t accept his father''s invitation. Tom knows that it would be bondage, giving up what little integrity he has left. He shows her the check, and she is astonished and delighted at its size: “There isn’t that much money in the world!” Then he asks what would happen if he ceased to be “disagreeable” and did what she wants, and she melts. Their flirtatious conversation is full of double meaning, and Tom continues with quotes that go over Cee''s head. She does not blink when he says “your lips drop honeycomb and your mouth is smoother than oil.” He is referring to Proverbs 5:3 “For the lips of the adulterous woman drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil.”
Cecelia gaily promises “no more locks,” and with each champagne toast (which Tom does not actually drink), she grows more seductive. At last, telling him not to be long, she slinks into the bedroom.
Tom rings for Red, and when Red tells Tom he is off for good, Tom asks to borrow his pen. Tom endorses his father''s check to Cee and tucks it into the finial of an ornate clock murmuring, “on the mantelpiece.”
Tom insists on driving Red to the station,  halting Red''s protests by adding, gravely, "I''m going back to my wife...to my wife," referring to Daisy.  They walk out, and the camera pulls back and pauses for a moment on the empty living room.
Important Information for Viewers
In the penultimate scene, in her sitting room,  Cee teasingly accuses Tom of “having the quotes,” and he certainly does. The revealing phrases all go over her head:
“The little more and how much it is” is from Stanza XXXIX (39) of “By the Fire-Side” one of Robert Browning’s poems to his wife, Elizabeth Barrett Browning: “Oh, the little more, and how much it is! And the little less, and what worlds away!”
“...infinite riches in a little room” is said by the title character of Christopher Marlowe’s The Jew of Malta, a wealthy miser: “This is the ware wherein consists my wealth; And thus methinks should men of judgment frame Their means of traffic from the vulgar trade, And, as their wealth increaseth, so inclose Infinite riches in a little room.”“Little lamb, who made me?... Red, dost thou know who made me?” refers to William Blake’s poem The Lamb.Although he knows the custom of the house at The Florentine, Tom never states that he was a regular client. Given the fact that the purchasing power of 20£ in 1932 was the equivalent of more than 1,300£ or $1,740 in 2019, and that guineas (21 shillings instead of 20) would be worth even more, it seems unlikely. Perhaps he was there for a  “celebration” when he was up at Oxford. )',NULL,'["Horace Jackson","Philip Barry"]','["Ann Harding","Leslie Howard","Myrna Loy"]','["Comedy","Drama","Romance"]','6.4','["tt0024785","tt0023537","tt0025091","tt0023362","tt0029058","tt0023986","tt0040556","tt0021874","tt0030554","tt0023590","tt0021873","tt0023491"]','["Comedy; Drama; Leslie Howard"]','[{"url":"/Animal_Kingdom.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Animal_Kingdom_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/Animal_Kingdom_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','Animal_Kingdom',28810,'Q1514624','wp',NULL,'["Edward H.

Chauvel also used footage of Polynesian women dancers; and film of an underwater shipwreck, filmed with a glass bottomed boat, which he believed was the Bounty but was probably not. This was Chauvel''s first ''talkie'' and he had clearly at this stage not yet learned to direct actors: the dialogue is very stiff and amateurish. The use of long sections of documentary footage with a voice over, combined with acted scenes, is similar to the hybrid silent and talking pictures that were produced during the transition to sound. It also represents the combination of interests of the director, and he returned to documentary toward the end of his career with the BBC television series Walkabout. Despite the poorly written dialogue, the documentary sections retain their excellence. A return to enactments at the end of the film, with one scripted modern scene in which a child suffers because of the lack of regular ship visits which could have taken the child to hospital, probably sought to make the film a useful voice for the Pitcairn Island community, who had been generous with their participation.

During this very uncertain and stressful transitional period, he plays the field to help stay relaxed. He discovers almost by accident that he has a talent for debt collecting and intimidation. He then decides to pay a visit to a mid-level wiseguy acquaintance and offer up his services.
His first task is to collect from a certain Bernie Feldshuh. Before he can deliver the swag to his capo, he is intercepted by Bernie''s henchmen, who take back the money and leave him for dead. Jerry returns to Bernie''s home while still healing from his gunshot wounds and extracts a moderate amount of retribution. Bernie''s response is to hire a top-notch assassin named Marley to take down Jerry as well as the lawyer named Herb Greene who commissioned him to collect on the debt in the first place. An unfortunate secretary becomes collateral damage. Jerry''s boss Anthony learns of the deed and sends a man of his own to even the score. An unfortunate bodyguard becomes collateral damage, and Jerry never does recover the $28,000.
His next assignment is to team up with enforcers Joe and Serge to conduct a raid on a shop manager for $40,000 that he may or may not have "owed" to somebody. But Bernie''s newly hired hitman Marley is watching and waiting for an opportunity to take Jerry down. This proves disastrous for the entire operation. After the heist, the trio of gangsters heads over to a hotel room to count out the profits and celebrate a little.
While Jerry is downstairs in the hotel restaurant, their secret adversary, Marley, assassinates both Serge and Joe. He makes off with the money as well. At this point, Jerry''s handler Tony begins accusing him of keeping the loot for himself. He refuses to believe that Jerry could make off with so much money, only to immediately lose it all again. Nobody could possibly be that incompetent. Jerry manages to tease out the contractor''s identity from a restaurateur named Spinoza. He hunts Marley down and terminates his career in a field of tall grass.
Later, he receives a call from Gus at the local junk yard. A camper comes in to tell that Jerry might be able to salvage for himself and his live-in girlfriend Paula. Just as things begin looking rosy for Jerry and Paula, he is bushwhacked right in front of the battered red camper by three gun-toting villains. He dies as a result.

Mutaguchi and his associates attempt to hire Tsurugi to kidnap Sarai, the daughter of a recently deceased oil tycoon. Tsurugi refuses after discovering that the gangsters are Yakuza. He escapes, but the Yakuza gangsters resolve to kill Tsurugi as well as kidnap Sarai. Tsurugi immediately seeks out Sarai, who is being protected at the Nippon Seibukan dojo by her uncle, Kendō Masaoka, a Karate master. Tsurugi captures Sarai and challenges the entire dojo to a fight.

Returning to the train, he escapes an angry conductor by ducking into a compartment occupied by attractive blonde Jackie Winthrop (Carole Lynne), with whom Gander flirts. Another passenger, Teddy (Richard Murdoch), has his eye on Jackie as well, but her companion Richard Winthrop (Peter Murray-Hill) ejects both of them from the compartment.
When the train stops at Fal Vale Junction, Cornwall, these four get off to change trains, as do Herbert (Stuart Latham) and his fiancée Edna (Betty Jardine), spinster Miss Bourne (Kathleen Harrison), and the tippling Dr. Sterling (Morland Graham). However, the stationmaster, Saul Hodgkin (Herbert Lomas) tells them the last Truro-bound train has gone, and that they cannot remain at the station, as he is locking up for the night. The passengers insist on staying, as it is raining heavily and the nearest village is four miles away.
Hodgkin warns them the station is haunted. A branch line once crossed the river on a swing bridge close to the station. One night 43 years ago, then stationmaster Ted Holmes had a fatal heart attack while attempting to close the bridge, causing a train to plunge into the river. Ever since, a phantom train has been heard periodically on the abandoned track. It is said to kill anyone who looks upon it.
With that, he reluctantly leaves them. As the passengers make themselves as comfortable as they can, they hear footsteps outside. Richard opens the door, and Hodgkin collapses into the room. Dr. Sterling pronounces him dead. Later, a terrified young woman in black (Linden Travers) appears. She, Julia, pleads for help, saying that someone is pursuing her. A car spins off the road and crashes into a tree. The driver is unhurt, but his car is damaged. Back in the waiting room, he introduces himself as John Price (Raymond Huntley) and explains that he is searching for his sister Julia, who he says suffers from delusions. Julia protests that he is lying. Price further explains that she thought she had seen the ghost train, and became obsessed with it ever since. The passengers tell him that Hodgkin has died. When Price insists on seeing the body, they discover it has mysteriously vanished.
Price leaves to arrange transportation. Then an approaching train is heard. As it thunders past, Julia smashes a window to look at it, then screams and faints. They hear singing from the nearby railway tunnel mouth. Julia claims that Ben Isaacs (D. J. Williams), the sole survivor of the accident, is coming back. Teddy shoots at the "ghost", causing it to flee back into the tunnel, leaving behind a bloodstained cloth.
Teddy shows the others the cloth and orders the others, at gunpoint, to stay put until the police arrive, but Richard punches him, knocking him out. The passengers carry him to the bus Price has obtained. When Teddy comes to, he is furious with Richard, as now there will be no one to intercept the train on its return journey. When Gander remarks that he had returned the bridge to the open position, Dr. Sterling suddenly orders the bus driver to stop, while his confederate, Price, produces his own gun. Sterling orders the driver to turn back so they can warn the train.
Meanwhile, guns are being loaded aboard the "ghost train"; a very much alive Hodgkin flags the train off and climbs aboard. Teddy explains that the train is really being used by Nazi Fifth Columnists to secretly transport arms. While Price heads down the embankment with Julia and the driver to try to stop the train, Teddy knocks Sterling out and gains control of the situation. The train plunges into the river.','["Walter Forde"]','["Arnold Ridley","J.O.C.

Tommy''s exact status is unclear; Mrs. O’Meara''s says he is a friend of her son Eddie and “stays here with us and a finer lad never trod the green earth.”  Tommy works in a grocery store and more than pulls his weight around the O’Meara home, but his foster brother Eddie is unemployed and hanging around a pool hall with a gang of teenage thieves led by Mike Hearn, the pool hall owner.
Hearn promises teenage ‘Knuckles’ Malone $50 to steal a fur coat from a warehouse and sends Eddie O’Meara along to drive the getaway car.  When the heist is thwarted and Knuckles nabbed by the police, Eddie escapes with the stolen goods and returns home. Tommy tries to repair the damage and keep the incident from Mrs. O’Meara by dumping the car and the furs outside of town.  He is picked up by the police.  In court, Tommy takes the rap in order to spare Mrs. O’Meara the grief of seeing her son implicated in the crime.  Tommy and Knuckles are sentenced to the State Industrial School for three years.  When alone for a moment with Eddie, Tommy urges him to take good care of his mother.
At the State School, Tommy remains true to himself.  He is honest, hard working, and well mannered.  Dr. Owens, once a reform school inmate himself but now a morally upright professional man, takes an interest in the boy and urges him to plan for life after prison.  He has Tommy removed from the crew at the school''s farm to work in his office.
One day, Tommy discovers Eddie O’Meara is an inmate in the reformatory.  Eddie dropped out of Hearn''s gang of thieves and found a job in order to take care of his mother, but Hearn feared Eddie would squeal to the police about the gang''s past.  Hearn decided to get the boy out of his way by staging a robbery at the gas station where the boy worked and then framing him. Hearn now fears that Tommy, Eddie, and Knuckles will now “squawk” and realizes his operation is still in jeopardy.  He decides to “spring” the three boys from prison and to silence them once he has them in his clutches.  Tommy is reluctant to participate in the escape but when he learns that Hearn threats to rough up Mrs. O’Meara he has no choice but to escape and protect her.  The escape plan is foiled, but later, Tommy and Knuckles manage to escape at gunpoint.
At the pool hall, Tommy convinces Hearn he is on his side.  A heist is planned.  Tommy secretly makes plans to meet Dr. Owens at the site of the heist to apprehend Hearn and his gang.   Hearn and his men are taken into custody after a car chase.  With Dr. Owens assistance, Tommy and Eddie are paroled and restored to Mrs. O’Meara.','["Howard Bretherton"]','["Ray Trampe","Norman S.

The second stays and has several other tricks played on him, such as furniture being moved around and the sudden appearance of a skeleton.

Recovering from the spectres'' attack, the man is visibly dazed and is brought the woman from the cauldron, who impresses him with her beauty. Mephistopheles then turns her into a withered old crone in front of the man''s eyes, then again into the four spectres.
The second cavalier returns and after a brief show of bravery, flees again, this time by leaping over the balcony''s edge.

The original Korean version is considered lost.In South Korea, a family gathers for the wedding of an astronaut, however, the astronaut is called back to duty to monitor a nuclear test in the Middle East. The test triggers an earthquake that shifts the epicenter to the heart of Korea. The authorities initially withhold this information from the public until they are sure the quake strikes but once the earthquake reaches the Hwanghae province, the authorities impose martial law for the area. The quake strikes Panmunjom, where a photographer takes pictures of the ground splitting, which reveals a giant creature moving inside. The photographer manages to get away but crashes his car due to the quake. The photographer manages to reach the authorities and deliver the photographs of the creature before succumbing to his injuries. The authorities name the creature “Yongary”, based on an old Korean fable about a monster connected to earthquakes.
While South Korea is being evacuated, the South Korean Army is dispatched to the Inwang area to attack Yongary but with no success. Il-Woo, a young scientist, decides to go to Seoul to find a weakness in Yongary. His girlfriend, Soona, opposes this but he goes anyway. Soona and her younger brother, Icho, pursue Il-Woo to try to stop him. Yongary eventually reaches Seoul and causes complete destruction. During the rampage, Il-Woo and Soona lose Icho and walk around trying to find him. The military suggests using guided missiles against Yongary but the authorities fear the missiles might do more damage than the monster and may destroy the landmarks of old Korea. However, the authorities decide that Korea''s future is more important and agree to use the guided missiles. Icho manages to escape through the city''s sewers and reaches an oil refinery where he finds Yongary drinking oil and gasoline. Icho turns off the main valve which causes Yongary to go berserk and destroy a tank that triggers a chemical reaction that makes Yongary itch and scratch.
Icho then returns to Il-Woo''s house to tell him what happened at the refinery. Il-Woo then reveals this discovery to the authorities and urges them to not use the guided missiles because they will give him more energy but his claims are brushed off and they proceed with the missile plan regardless. Il-Woo then goes to work on a chemical to defeat Yongary using a precipitate of ammonia. Yongary is then struck with Il-Woo''s ammonia and missiles, which is enough to put him temporarily to sleep, however, Il-Woo believes the ammonia needs more work. Icho takes a light device from Il-Woo''s lab and shines it on an immobile Yongary, which triggers him to wake up. To Icho''s amusement, Yongary then begins dancing but then returns to his rampage. Il-Woo loads the finalized ammonia onto a helicopter and dumps it on Yongary in the Han River, where Yongary collapses and dies. The following morning, Il-Woo is commended for his role in defeating Yongary, however, he cites Icho as the real hero for providing him with the information of Yongary''s eating habits. In the end, Icho opines that Yongary was not evil by nature but rather, simply looking for food.','["Ki-duk Kim"]','["Ki-duk Kim","Yun-sung Seo"]','["Yeong-il Oh","Jeong-im Nam","Sun-jae Lee"]','["Action","Adventure","Comedy","Drama","Fantasy","Horror","Sci-Fi","Thriller"]','3.8','["tt0109916","tt0188640","tt0060446","tt0063172","tt0097444","tt0255198","tt0067148","tt0058544","tt0101962","tt0058379","tt0059346","tt0062411"]','["yongary; monster; korean; movie; cinematedman;"]','[{"url":"/YongaryMonsterFromTheDeepHostedByTheCinematedMan.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/YongaryMonsterFromTheDeepHostedByTheCinematedMan_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/YongaryMonsterFromTheDeep_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','YongaryMonsterFromTheDeep',9699,'Q489379','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

After the class is dismissed, she releases the boy and tells him that few can do what they want in life, so they might as well make the best of what they have. She is overheard by Margaret Ree, an older teacher. Margaret tells Anne that she regrets not doing wild things when she was young. She advises Anne to do what she never did. Anne decides to take her advice and treat herself to one day of freedom. 
She buys a pretty dress and hosiery and releases her pet canary Delilah. Sitting in a public park, Anne is propositioned by "Handsome", a persistent guy who will not go away. Anne finally knocks him down and drives off in his car. Handsome turns out to be a killer, he stole the car she is in, and on the floor of the back seat is the body of a man that he and his partner Red have murdered. Slick, their boss, is displeased when he learns that the body is hidden under his overcoat, which has a label with his name on it. Slick gives Red ten hours to get the coat back, or else. The police are also looking for the stolen vehicle. Unaware of any of this, Anne picks up a handsome young man named Larry Cameron, whose car has broken down.
Police officer Kelly spots the car and gives chase, but Anne manages to lose him. They head to the local country club for refreshments. Larry turns out to know far more about Anne''s predicament than she does, pointing out that she has a corpse in the back seat. Snuffy, a snitch, runs into Red and tells him he found the car he is looking for. After Red leaves, Snuffy telephones Kelly. When Larry sees Kelly by the car, he points Red out as the driver. While Kelly is chasing Red, Larry and Anne drive away.
They stop for gas at a station. The attendant recognizes them as fugitives, but Larry ties him up. Mrs. Breckenbridge pulls up in her chauffeur-driven limousine.  While the newcomers are distracted, Larry switches license plates.
Then Larry and Anne break into an empty house, but Red and Handsome track them down. Fortunately, Larry manages to knock Red out and Handsome runs away after Anne burns him with a cigarette. Mrs. Breckenbridge also shows up, after an encounter with Kelly. It comes out that they "broke into" Larry''s home; the car is also Larry''s. Despite Anne''s assumption, he is not a crook. When the pair return the car to the park for the police to find, two other gang members take them at gunpoint to Slick. Then Mrs. Breckenbridge bursts in. She was following in her car and, when she saw her friends being captured, sent her chauffeur for the police, who arrive and capture the gang. 
Afterward, Anne tells Granny Gladden that she and Larry are getting married. Granny tells her that Delilah has returned too, also with a companion.','["Al Christie"]','["Frederick J.

He hurries to be first in line to enlist in the Confederate Army, but is rejected because he is too valuable in his present job, but is not told that reason. On leaving, he runs into Annabelle''s father and brother, who beckon to him to join them in line, but he walks away, giving them the impression that he does not want to enlist. Annabelle informs Johnnie that she will not speak to him again until he is in uniform.
A year passes and Annabelle receives word that her father has been wounded and travels north on the W&ARR to see him with The General pulling the train. When it makes a stop, the passengers detrain for a quick meal. As previously planned, Union spies led by Captain Anderson use the opportunity to steal the train. Anderson''s objective is to burn all the railroad bridges he passes, thus preventing reinforcement and resupply of the Confederate army. Annabelle becomes an inadvertent prisoner of the raiders.
Johnnie gives chase, first on foot, then by handcar and boneshaker bicycle, before reaching a station in Chattanooga. He alerts the army detachment there, which boards another train to give chase, with Johnnie manning the locomotive, Texas. However, the flatcars are not hooked up to the engine and the troops are left behind. By the time Johnnie realizes he is alone, it is too late to turn back.
The Union agents try various methods to shake their pursuer, including disconnecting their trailing car and dropping railroad ties on the tracks. As the duel continues northward, the Confederate Army of Tennessee is ordered to retreat and the Northern army advances in its wake. Johnnie finally notices he is surrounded by Union soldiers and the hijackers see that Johnnie is by himself. Johnnie stops the Texas and runs into the forest to hide.
At nightfall, Johnnie stumbles upon the Northern encampment. Hungry, he climbs through a window to steal some food, but hides underneath the table when some officers enter. He overhears their plan for a surprise attack and that the Rock River Bridge is essential for their supporting supply trains. He then sees Annabelle brought in; she is taken to a room under guard while they decide what to do with her. Johnnie manages to knock out both guards and free Annabelle and they escape into the rainy woods.

The next day, Johnnie and Annabelle find themselves near a railway station, where Union soldiers and equipment are being organized for the attack. Seeing The General, Johnnie devises a plan to warn the South. After sneaking Annabelle onto a boxcar, Johnnie steals his engine back. Two Union trains, including the Texas, set out after the pair, while the Union attack is immediately launched. In a reversal of the first chase, Johnnie now has to fend off his pursuers. Finally, he starts a fire behind The General in the center of the Rock River Bridge to cut off the Union''s important supply line.
Reaching friendly lines, Johnnie warns the Confederate commander of the impending attack and their forces rush to defend the bridge. Meanwhile, Annabelle is reunited with her convalescing father. The pursuing Texas drives onto the burning bridge, which collapses. When Union soldiers try to ford the river, Confederate fire drives them back.
Afterward, Johnnie returns to his locomotive to find the Union officer whom he had knocked out in escaping earlier has now regained consciousness. He takes the officer prisoner and is spotted by the general leaving the locomotive with him. As a reward for his bravery, he is commissioned a lieutenant and given the captured officer''s sword.
Returning to The General with Annabelle, he tries to kiss his girl but has to return the salutes of troops walking past. Johnnie finally uses his left hand to embrace Annabelle while using his right to blindly salute the passing soldiers while the screen fades.',NULL,'["Buster Keaton","Clyde Bruckman"]','["Buster Keaton","Marion Mack","Glen Cavender"]','["Action","Adventure","Comedy","Drama","War","Western"]','8.1','["tt0015324","tt0016332","tt0019254","tt0015163","tt0018455","tt0031679","tt0025316","tt0021749","tt0017136","tt0014341","tt0032553","tt0015648"]','["railroad;war;locomotive;Buster Keaton;silent movie"]','[{"url":"/The_General.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/The_General_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/The_General_Buster_Keaton_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','The_General_Buster_Keaton',204854,'Q850159','wp',NULL,'["Clyde Bruckman","Buster Keaton"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

His manager decides that the doorman is getting too old and infirm to present the image of the hotel, and so demotes him to a less demanding job, of washroom attendant. He tries to conceal his demotion from his friends and family but, to his shame, he is discovered.  His friends, thinking he has lied to them all along about his prestigious job, taunt him mercilessly while his family rejects him out of shame.  The man, shocked and in incredible grief, returns to the hotel to sleep in the washroom where he works.  The only person to be kind towards him is the night watchman, who covers him with his coat as he falls asleep.
Following this comes the film''s only title card, which says: "Here our story should really end, for in actual life, the forlorn old man would have little to look forward to but death. The author took pity on him, however, and provided quite an improbable epilogue."At the end, the doorman reads in the newspaper that he inherited a fortune from a Mexican millionaire named A. G. Money, a patron who died in his arms in the hotel washroom. Jannings returns to the hotel, where he dines happily with the night watchman who showed him kindness.

Just south of Mexicali, they pick up a hitchhiker named Emmett Myers (William Talman), whose stolen car has apparently run out of gas. Myers turns out to be a psychopath who has committed multiple murders while hitch-hiking between Illinois and Southern California, and has managed to slip into Mexico at Mexicali. To evade the pursuing authorities, Myers forces the two men at gunpoint to journey deep into the heart of the Baja California Peninsula, toward the town of Santa Rosalía, where he plans to take a ferry across the Gulf of California.
Meanwhile, the men try to plot their escape from the violent, paranoid Myers. They try tactics such as sabotaging their car and leaving clues (like an engraved wedding ring) at various points on their journey. One man badly twists his ankle during an escape attempt. The sadistic Myers physically and mentally torments the men, forcing them to continue on foot and mocking their loyalty to each other by claiming that they could have escaped separately if they embraced Myers'' each-man-for-himself ethos.
They closely follow the tracking of Myers - which is covered extensively on the radio - and later on is purposely altered to suggest that he is still in the United States so that the two men will not be at risk.
Arriving at Santa Rosalía, Myers tries to conceal his identity by forcing one of the men to wear his clothes. Myers, upon discovering that the regular ferry to Guaymas has burned down, hires a fishing boat. However, while he is awaiting the fisherman, locals discover his status as a wanted murderer and contact authorities. Police surround the pier and, after some confusion over Myers'' identity, take him into custody following a brief scuffle in which the boastful Myers is revealed to be a coward.

The documentary then features several one-on-one interviews from various members of the church. These interviews reveal stories of how many of the church''s members found salvation through the Holy Ghost and how the Holy Ghost saves them in their daily lives.  Some members reveal stories of how they are able to speak in tongues; others reveal how they communicate with God, who sometimes paralyzes them. The final interview is of an old woman who shakes and sometimes convulses on camera while going in and out of speaking in tongues.
The film then cuts to the beginning of a church service. As men enter the church, they go up and kiss each other on the lips before they are seated.  After everyone is seated, people start clapping and singing together.  Then there is a cut to the pastor talking to the congregation. He invites those who have not found the Holy Ghost to find out. He also tells the congregation to ignore the cameraman and to act as though it was just another normal night. The pastor continues his sermon, and the documentary uses various cuts to show that a long period of time has passed.
Eventually, the church service moves into a time of prayer.  The people stand and announce their prayer concerns to the congregation. The pastor tells people that God will answer their prayers if they only believe.  They then bring a woman, who is rapidly losing her eyesight, to the front of the church to pray for. The camera pans to the rest of the church and shows that everyone else has formed into small groups and are all praying at the same time.  The different styles of prayer include standing still, lying on the floor, and convulsing seemingly uncontrollably.
The end of the film contains a lot of fast cuts in order to show everything that happened in the service.  A new man preaches, followed by two people who lead the congregation in worship.  After clapping and singing, snakes are brought out to the snake handlers.  As the music and clapping continue, people begin to get up and dance.  Various people throughout the church handle several snakes, and a man who dances violently quickly collapses to the ground and lies there.  No one rushes to help him.  The music stops so that people can provide testimonies and the church can take an offering. The pastor handles a snake as he tries to get people to give money to the church.  The snake bites the pastor on the hand.  The film ends with a shot of the pastor''s swollen hand.','["Peter Adair"]',NULL,'["Peter Adair","Brenda Lanham","Michael Lanham"]','["Documentary"]','7.0','[]','["snakes;religion;Christians;ceremony;ecstacy;Pentacostal"]','[{"url":"/HolyGhost1.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/HolyGhost1_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/HolyGhost2.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/HolyGhost2_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/HolyGhostPeople_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','HolyGhostPeople',138987,'Q12124808','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

On 15 September 1940, during the Battle of Britain, RAF Squadron Leader Geoffrey Crisp (David Niven), the station commander of a Spitfire squadron, recounts the story of how his friend, R. J. Mitchell (Leslie Howard) designed the Spitfire fighter. His pilots listen as Crisp begins with the 1922 Schneider Trophy competition, where Mitchell began his most important work, designing high speed aircraft. While watching seagulls with his binoculars, he envisages a new shape for aircraft in the future. Crisp, an ex-First World War pilot seeking work, captivates Mitchell with his enthusiasm and the designer promises to hire him as test pilot should his design ever go into production. Facing opposition from official sources, Mitchell succeeds in creating a series of highly successful seaplane racers, eventually winning the Schneider Trophy outright for Great Britain.
After a visit to Germany in the 1930s and a chance meeting with leading German aircraft designer Willy Messerschmitt and after hearing talk of German Re-Armament Mitchell resolves to build the fastest and deadliest fighter aircraft. Convincing Henry Royce of Rolls-Royce that a new engine, eventually to become the famous Rolls-Royce Merlin, is needed, Mitchell gets the powerplant he requires. Faced by the devastating news that he has only one year to live and battling against failing health, Mitchell dies as the first prototype Supermarine Spitfire takes to the skies. Crisp ends his account when the squadron is scrambled to counter a German attack: the fight sees the Germans beaten, with the Luftwaffe losing more planes than the British. In the end, Crisp is happy over the victory and looks to the heavens to Mitchell, voicing a thanks to Mitchell for creating the Spitfire.','["Leslie Howard"]','["Henry C.

As he wonders how to pay the rent, he discovers that he can see the contents of his mind unfolding whilst looking into his eyes in the mirror. He realises that he can apply his  gift to others ("If you can look inside yourself, you can look inside anyone!"), and sets up a business in his room, selling tailor-made dreams to a variety of frustrated and neurotic clients. Each of the seven  surreal dream sequences in the diegesis is in fact the creation of a contemporary avant-garde and/or surrealist artist, as follows:

Dialogue by Richard Holback and Hans Richter
Joe''s waiting room is full within minutes of his first day of operation, "the first installment on the  2 billion clients" according to the male narrator in voiceover.
Case number one is Mr and Mrs A. Mr A is a "methodical, exact" bank clerk. His wife "complains [he] has a mind like a double entry column; no virtues, no vices". She wants a dream for him "with practical values to widen his horizons, heighten ambitions, maybe a raise in salary". Joe asks Mrs A to leave the room during Mr A''s consultation. Mr A reveals that within his ledger he has a collection of art images cut from magazines, including  drawings of a woman reclining in bed; another on an old man''s lap; another being shot by an animal-headed man; a filmic image of red liquid passing through water, and another of a melting wax figure of a woman.
Joe "finds a dream" for Mr A based on these interests. In the dream ("Desire") leaves fall to the ground beside a red curtain. A woman in white reclines in a red-curtained four-poster bed. A small golden ball rises and falls from her mouth as she breathes. She swallows the ball, smiles and falls asleep. Jail bars appear by her bed, and a voyeuristic man watches from behind them as the woman dreams of nightingales with calves'' hooves. It appears the man is part of her dream, and telephones her to ask in voiceover for details.  She tells him in voiceover "they talked about love and pleasure". The telephone by her bedside falls to the floor, breaks open and exudes a misty smoke, which envelops her bed. Two young men tumble over each other in what seems like a war scene of shipwrecked sailors. One of the young men and a woman are pulled from underneath the bed by a man dressed as a formal authority figure (Max Ernst).  The voyeur man watching breaks through the jail bars and  enters the bedroom, raising the woman from her bed, and they embrace.  They exit the room, and awkwardly tumble down through a basement corridor wreathed in steam. The authority figure impassively watches them. The voyeur plays dice in the leaves of a dark brick-lined corridor,  The narrating woman''s voice says "who wants to come with me under my warm white gown," repeating the last three words several times and closes with the woman tossing the small golden ball into the air and catching it.
Case number two ("The Girl With the Prefabricated Heart") begins as Joe accepts payment from Mr. A and ends his session, as a young woman wearing a suit, glasses, and a beret enters the room carrying a briefcase, and Mrs. A returns and glares.  The A''s leave.  The young woman tries to "sign Joe up" for various causes.  In voiceover, she tries to convince Joe while we hear a man''s voice telling Joe to resist her.  She flirts, cries, almost leaves, comes back.  The music features a repeated wolf whistle over a light jazz tune.  Joe signs.  He removes her glasses and they almost kiss.  Smoke fills the screen, and clears with a closeup on a dismembered mannequin.  The music is a light tune sung by Holman with the refrain of "untouched by human hands."  It segues into a sequence in which wigged and costumed mannequins seem to dance and pose.  Holman and White sing.  Whirling wheel graphics punctuate the scenes as jewellery is offered to "a healthy girl", Julie, as the male singer/mannequin woos her.  She cries "this is ridiculous! Sisters, come to my aid!" and "so from his ardent arms she fled." The male mannequin is beheaded as Julie rides on an exercise cycle dressed in a bridal gown.  "for there''s no man alive who could ever survive a girl with a prefabricated heart."  We transition back to Joe''s office as the young woman leaves, then suddenly returns and kisses him, then leaves again.
As she leaves, Mrs. A returns with a garbled, speeded up voiceover expressing her stream of consciousness.   Case number three begins. "You''ll find out nothing here – this man is obviously a fake of some kind."  But she wants a treatment...Joe shows the lady a photo of a young smiling couple.  The young woman in the photo reminds Mrs A of herself when she was a carefree girl.  Mrs. A realizes she wants to break the shell around her and has a dream of the same young couple with the man reading a declaration from a book titled “Ruth, Roses and Revolvers.”  The young man is apparently trying to woo the woman “those who have insured themselves against all risks are bound to lose all.”  The couple joins others at a film screening  were the group watches a man on the screen who goes through various poses and gestures.  The audience imitates the man in the film by repeating his gestures.  After the screening  the couple sees the book leaning against a tree.  One woman jokes “all we need now is a revolver.”  The man turns the book around.  On the back cover is a photo of Man Ray, the author,  and we see superimposed a procession of wounded soldiers.
Mrs. A pays in cash and leaves with the photo.  Outside the room there is a chaotic riot and an impotent policeman doing nothing but holding a pose.  In the ensuing commotion a gangster (case number four) has made his way into Joe’s office.  He wants a dream that might help him win the horse races.  The dream consists of spinning disc illusions (by Marcel Duchamp) and a prism distorted version of “Nude Descending a Staircase.”  The gangster is unimpressed and robs Joe at gunpoint.  A policeman enters and asks the gangster for a gun license.  The gangster produces it and the cop lets him go.  Joe is knocked unconscious by the gangster who flees the room.
Case number five and six – A blind old man and a little girl enter the empty office.  The girl plays with a ball that becomes a collection of Alexander Calder’s mobiles.  A sombre mask watches the playful movements of the mobiles.  Joe regains consciousness and re-enters his office to find the two new inhabitants.  The blind man actually wants to sell a dream rather than buy one.  He makes circus figures out of wire and the figures come to life and perform.  Joe buys the dream.
Case number seven: The next customer doesn’t answer the desk buzzer.  Joe goes to the door and sees that the next customer is himself, standing frozen, surrounded by blocks of ice.  Joe finds a blue poker chip that the little girl left on the floor and he enters his own autobiographical dream.  He is playing poker with his friends around a table being watched over by a classical bust of a bearded man (Morpheus?).  As Joe reaches for a liquor glass, it explodes.  In the spilt fluid on the table, he sees his own reflection.  Joe’s skin suddenly turns blue, causing his friends to reject him (“would you want to sit at a table with a blue man?”).  They leave Joe alone in the room where his furniture becomes alive and closes in on him.  He finds a blue cord and follows it (“the blue thread of hope will lead me out of the labyrinth”).  The cord leads outdoors where he is accosted by the public who block his progress (“the right of being in everybody’s way is the right of everybody.”)  The people turn into ladders leading up in four directions.  Joe chooses a ladder and starts to climb.  He remembers the jubilance at the end of World War II  and the prospect of peace and optimism.  Streamers fall from the sky.  Suddenly Joe realizes the rungs are disappearing from his ladder.  He desperately grabs a window sill and pulls himself inside a room.  Dangling colorful circles surround a woman reclining in a hammock.  She offers Joe a drink, a bowl of cherries and a knife.  He kisses the woman and makes a move to slice open her throat but instead cuts the blue cord he’s been following.  The cord bleeds red.  Joe exits the room and re-enters the poker room.  The bearded bust bursts into flames.  He again sees his friends around the poker table but now they’ve become flaming bird cages.  He takes the bearded bust and attempts to escape out his window – hanging by a rope.  The woman he abandoned uses the knife to cut his escape rope.  Joe and the statue fall but become balls of colored ink in water that rains down upon the broken classical bust on the pavement below that appears to be staring upward into the colored patterns.','["Hans Richter"]','["Hans Richter","Hans Richter"]','["Jack Bittner","Libby Holman","Josh White"]','[""]','6.8','["tt0146367","tt0123318","tt0014872","tt0066019","tt0036154","tt0173024","tt0011237","tt0059415","tt0060802","tt0105791","tt0012620","tt0122855"]','["Surrealist; Hans Richter; Max Ernst; Fernand Léger; Man Ray; Venice Film Festival; Experimental; Art Film"]','[{"url":"/dreams-that-money-can-buy.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/dreams-that-money-can-buy_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/dreams-that-money-can-buy_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','dreams-that-money-can-buy',46992,'Q2362995','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
('tt0036241','free','The Outlaw (1943)','1943','1h 56min','Sheriff Pat Garrett (Thomas Mitchell) welcomes his old friend Doc Holliday (Walter Huston) to Lincoln, New Mexico. Doc is looking for his stolen horse and finds it in the possession of Billy the Kid (Jack Buetel). Despite this, the two gunfighters take a liking to each other, much to Pat''s disgust. This does not prevent Doc from trying to steal the horse back late that night, but Billy is waiting for him outside the barn.
After that, Billy decides to sleep in the barn, and shots are fired at him. He overpowers his ambusher, who turns out to be curvaceous young Rio McDonald (Jane Russell), Doc''s love-interest, who is out to avenge her dead brother. It is implied that he rapes her after ripping off her dress.The next day, a stranger offers to shoot Pat in the back while Billy distracts the lawman. However, he is only setting the Kid up. Billy, suspicious as always, guns him down just before being shot himself. There are no witnesses, and Pat tries to arrest Billy. Pat does not understand when Doc sides with the Kid. As the pair start to leave, Pat shoots Billy, forcing Doc to shoot the gun out of his hand and kill two of Pat''s men.
Doc flees with Billy to the home of Rio and her aunt, Guadalupe (Mimi Aguglia). With a posse after them, Doc rides away. Instead of killing the unconscious Kid, Rio instead nurses him to health, a process that takes a month. By the time Doc returns, Rio has fallen in love with her patient. Doc is furious that Billy has stolen his girlfriend. After Doc''s anger subsides a bit, the Kid gives him a choice: the horse or Rio. To Billy''s annoyance, Doc picks the horse. Angered that both men value the animal more than her, Rio fills their canteens with sand. The two ride off without noticing.
On the trail, they find themselves being pursued by Pat and a posse. The pair surmise that Rio tipped the sheriff off. Doc kills a few men from long range, but leaves Pat unharmed.
When Doc wakes one morning, he finds Billy gone and Pat waiting to handcuff him and take him back. Stopping at Rio''s, the two men find that Billy has left Rio tied up in sight of water out of revenge. Suspecting that Billy loves Rio (even if he himself does not realize it) and will return to free her, Pat waits. Sure enough, the Kid comes back and is captured.
On the way back to town, however, they find hostile Mescaleros all around. Pat reluctantly frees his prisoners and returns their revolvers after extracting a promise from Doc that he will give them back and make Billy do the same. They manage to elude the Indians, but Doc refuses to honor his word.
As Doc tries to leave with his horse, Billy stops him. The two men decide to have a duel, with a pleased Pat expecting Billy to lose. However, as they await the signal (the end of a clock signalling eight o''clock), Billy realizes that Doc is a true friend, and moves his hands away from his guns. Doc tries to provoke him, inflicting minor wounds in one hand and both ears, but the Kid still will not fire. The two reconcile. Furious, Pat calls Doc out, despite not having a chance. Doc makes no attempt to shoot his friend and is fatally wounded. Pat is aghast.
After Doc is buried, Pat offers to give Billy their friend''s revolvers. He also persuades Billy to give him his guns, saying that he can claim that it is Billy in the grave. The Kid can leave his past behind him and have a fresh start in life. However, it is all a trick. Pat had removed the firing pins from Doc''s revolvers. However, while comparing the guns, he inadvertently switched one of Doc''s for his. As a result, neither his gun nor Pat''s fires. Billy pulls out a second, working gun. He handcuffs Pat, judging that the lawman will still state that Billy is dead rather than admit the Kid left him helpless. As he is riding away, Billy stops and looks back; an overjoyed Rio gets on his horse.',NULL,NULL,'["Jack Buetel","Thomas Mitchell","Jane Russell"]','["Comedy","Drama","Romance","Western"]','5.5','["tt0023594","tt0043643","tt0020960","tt0025948","tt0021770","tt0053236","tt0044825","tt0026097","tt0043781","tt0044683","tt0023825","tt0022792"]','["Western;pdmovies"]','[{"url":"/the_outlaw.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/the_outlaw_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/the_outlaw_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','the_outlaw',190023,'Q1521254','wp','["Jules Furthman"]','["Howard Hughes","Howard Hawks"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Stimson, the Secretary of War at the time, was quoted to create trust with the audience, "the purpose of these films is to give factual information as to the causes, the events leading up to our entry into the war and the principles for which we are fighting."

The purpose of the OWI was to use mass communication to appeal to both serving soldiers and later, the American population on the reasons for the war; therefore, they released Prelude to War to further these goals. The film commences with an explanation of how Americans were brought into the war through heroic motives to protect countries unable to protect themselves. America had this duty to righteousness and Christian values throughout history, according to the values and beliefs set forth by the founding fathers.The documentary makes use of compare and contrast methods throughout the film in order to transmit its heroic message. The primary images used within the film to portray the opponents of America are introduced by Henry Wallace as the "free world" — a brightly illuminated planet of the Allies, and a "slave world" as a planet deep in shadow of the Axis Powers.
It examines the differences between the U.S. and the fascist states of Benito Mussolini, Adolf Hitler and Yamamoto, portraying the latter countries working together as gangsters to conquer the world. In order to do this, Capra made use of footage from Triumph of the Will, but with different narration designed to support the Allied cause.
It is brought to the audience''s attention that after the Nazis smashed the opposing political parties and labor unions they turned their attention to their last remaining obstacle — the church. In one scene a stained glass window is shattered by several bricks to reveal a "Heil Hitler!" poster behind. To emphasize this depiction of Hitler as an antichrist figure, a class of German schoolchildren is shown singing to the song Frederick Rex:

When he sees that Tillie''s father (Mack Swain) has a very large bankroll for his workers, he persuades her to elope with him. In the city, he meets the woman he was seeing already, and tries to work around the complication to steal Tillie''s money. He gets Tillie drunk in a restaurant and asks her to let him hold the pocketbook. Since she is drunk, she agrees, and he escapes with his old girlfriend and the money.
Later that day, they see a picture show entitled "A Thief''s Fate", which illustrates their thievery in the form of a morality play. They both feel guilty and leave the theater. While sitting on a park bench, a paperboy (Gordon Griffith) asks him to buy a newspaper. He does so, and reads the story about Tillie''s Uncle Banks (Charles Bennett), a millionaire who died while on a mountain-climbing expedition. Tillie is named sole heir and inherits three million dollars. The man leaves his girlfriend on the park bench and runs to the restaurant, where Tillie is now forced to work to support herself as she is too embarrassed to go home. He begs her to take him back and although she is skeptical at first, she believes that he truly loves her and they marry. They move into the uncle''s mansion and throw a big party, which ends horribly when Tillie finds her husband with his old girlfriend, smuggled into the house and working as one of their maids.
The uncle is found on a mountaintop, alive after all. He goes back to his mansion, in disarray after Tillie instigated a gunfight (a direct result of the husband smuggling the old girlfriend into the house) which, luckily, did not harm anyone. Uncle Banks insists that Tillie be arrested for the damage she has caused to his house. The three run from the cops all the way to a dock, where a car "bumps" Tillie into the water. She flails about, hoping to be rescued. She is eventually pulled to safety, and both Tillie and the man''s girlfriend realize that they are too good for him.

('tt0016544','free','The Wizard of Oz (1925)','1925','1h 21min','A toymaker (Semon) reads L. Frank Baum''s book to his granddaughter. In the story the Land of Oz is ruled by Prime Minister Kruel (Josef Swickard), aided by Ambassador Wikked (Otto Lederer), Lady Vishuss (Virginia Pearson), and the Wizard (Charles Murray), a "medicine-show hokum hustler". When the discontented people, led by Prince Kynd (Bryant Washburn), demand the return of the princess, who disappeared while a baby many years before, so she can be crowned their rightful ruler, Kruel has the Wizard distract them with a parlor trick: making a female impersonator (Frederick Ko Vert) appear out of a seemingly empty basket. Kruel sends Wikked on a mission.
Meanwhile, in Kansas, Dorothy (Dorothy Dwan) lives on a farm with her relatives. While Aunt Em (Mary Carr) is a kind and caring woman, Uncle Henry (Frank Alexander) is an obese man with a short temper who shows little love for his niece. He also abuses his farmhands: Snowball (credited to G. Howe Black, a stage name for Spencer Bell, who frequently appeared in Semon''s films) and Hardy''s and Semon''s unnamed characters. The latter two are both in love with Dorothy, who favors Hardy''s character. Aunt Em reveals to Dorothy that she was placed on their doorstep as a baby, along with an envelope and instructions that it be opened only when she turned 18.
On her 18th birthday, however, Wikked and his minions arrive at the farm by biplane and demand the envelope. When Uncle Henry refuses to hand it over, Wikked suborns Hardy''s character by promising him wealth and Dorothy. Wikked then has Dorothy tied to a rope and raised high up a tower; his men start a fire underneath the rope. Hardy''s character finds the note, but Semon''s character takes it and saves Dorothy, only to have Wikked and his men capture them all at gunpoint.
Then a tornado suddenly strikes. Dorothy, the two rivals for her affection, and Uncle Henry take shelter inside a small wooden shed, which is—along with Snowball—carried aloft by the violent wind and soon deposited in the Land of Oz. Dorothy finally reads the contents of the envelope; it declares that she, Princess Dorothea, is the rightful ruler of Oz. Thwarted, Kruel blames the farmhands for kidnapping her and orders the Wizard to transform them into something else, such as monkeys, which he is of course unable to do. Chased by Kruel''s soldiers, Semon''s character disguises himself as a scarecrow, while Hardy improvises a costume from the pile of tin in which he is hiding. They are still eventually captured by the soldiers. During their trial, the Tin Man accuses his fellow farmhands of kidnapping Dorothy. Kynd has the Scarecrow and Snowball put in the dungeon.
Kruel makes the Tin Man "Knight of the Garter" and Uncle Henry the "Prince of Whales". Wikked suggests he retain his power by marrying Dorothy. The Wizard then helps the two prisoners escape by giving Snowball a lion costume, which he uses to scare away the guards. Though the Scarecrow manages to reach Dorothy to warn her against Kruel, he is chased back down into the dungeon by the Tin Man, and ends up getting trapped inside a lion cage (with real lions) for a while. He and Snowball finally escape.
When Kynd finds Kruel trying to force Dorothy to marry him, they engage in a sword fight. When Kruel''s henchmen intervene and help disarm Kynd, the Scarecrow saves Dorothy and Kynd. Defeated, Kruel claims that he took Dorothy to Kansas in order to protect her from court factions out to harm her, but she orders that he be taken away.
The Scarecrow is heartbroken to discover that Dorothy has fallen for Prince Kynd. He then flees up a tower from the Tin Man, who tries to blast him with a cannon. Snowball flies a biplane overhead, and the Scarecrow manages to grab a rope ladder dangling underneath it. However, the ladder breaks, and he falls. The scene shifts abruptly back to the little girl, who had fallen asleep. She wakes up and leaves. The grandfather reads from the book that Dorothy marries Prince Kynd and they live happily ever after.','["Larry Semon"]','["L.

Zé do Caixão (Coffin Joe), the local undertaker who disdains religion and emotion and who believes the only thing that matters is the "continuity of the blood" (specifically his own), is looking for the "perfect woman" to bear him a superior child who will be immortal. Since his wife Lenita has been found to be unable to bear children, Coffin Joe begins to make advances with Terezinha, the fiancée of Joe''s friend Antonio. Terezinha scolds him by telling him that Antonio is the only man in her life. During a Catholic holiday, Joe kills his wife Lenita (because of her infertility) by tying her up and having a venomous spider bite her. The local authorities cannot find a clue to arrest him and he remains free to do whatever he wants.
Some days later, Coffin Joe is invited by Antonio to visit a local gypsy who will tell the fortune of Antonio''s marriage with Terezinha. The gypsy reveals, however, that there is going to be a tragic disaster, and the two will never get married. Joe, in response, calls her a fraud and states that the supernatural is a hoax. She warns him not to mock the supernatural forces, lest they make him pay. That night, Joe and Antonio go to Antonio''s house, where Antonio tells Joe that he really didn''t believe the witch''s words, and that he expects to marry Terezinha and have a happy life together. Fulfilling the witch''s prophecy, Coffin Joe brutally bludgeons and then drowns Antonio in a bathtub.
Once again, the police can find no evidence to directly implicate Joe with the crime.  He proceeds with his plan to seduce Terezinha by purchasing a canary for her, which she accepts. Suddenly he starts to touch her against her will. Terezinha tries to resist, and Coffin Joe savagely beats her into a helpless state and rapes her. Finally able to speak, Terezinha curses him for his brutality, saying she will kill herself, then return to take his soul to hell. Joe laughs at her, but the next day she is found hanging in her home. To his surprise, she doesn''t blame him in her suicide note. Meanwhile, the village''s Dr. Rodolfo begins to suspect Joe for the recent outbreak of violent deaths that has occurred. When Joe becomes aware of the doctor''s suspicions, Coffin Joe appears at Dr. Rodolfo''s home, gouges his eyes with his long fingernails and sets him on fire.
Time passes, and Coffin Joe remains unpunished for his crimes. On the Day of the Dead he meets Marta, a young woman who is visiting her relatives, and decides to choose her as his next perfect woman. Joe escorts Marta home late at night, only to be confronted by the gypsy who predicted the doom of Antonio and Terezinha. She tells Joe that his soul shall be claimed by the ghosts of those he murdered and by Satan at midnight. Joe threatens the gypsy, but after leaving Marta at her destination, he is soon visited by ghostly apparitions that test his courage. Realizing he cannot face the apparitions, Joe runs away, and coincidentally arrives at the mausoleum where Antonio and Terezinha were buried. Finally at the edge of his sanity, Joe opens the coffins to prove to himself his victims are really dead, but instead sees that their eyes are open, as if they are still alive, faces crawling with maggots. Some time later, the villagers come to the mausoleum after hearing Coffin Joe''s blood-curdling screams and find him lying on his back, horribly disfigured, his eyes bulging open similar to the eyes of the two corpses.

Scientist Dr. Otto von Niemann, who cares for the victims, visits a patient who was attacked by a bat, Martha Mueller. Martha is visited by a mentally challenged man named Herman Glieb, who claims he likes bats because they are "soft like cat" and "nice". 
On the doctor''s journey home, he meets Kringen, one of the townsfolk, who claims to have been attacked by the vampire in the form of a bat, but withheld his story from the town in order to not spread fear. Dr. von Niemann encourages Kringen to tell the townsfolk of his story. Kringen becomes suspicious that Glieb may be the vampire due to his obsession with bats. Glieb lives with bats and collects them off the street.
Dr. von Niemann returns to his home, which also houses Breettschneider''s love Ruth Bertin, Ruth''s hypochondriac aunt Gussie Schnappmann, and servants Emil Borst and Gorgiana. Fear of the vampire and suspicion of Glieb quickly spread around the town and people start fearing him. Ms. Mueller is killed that night. The analyses of Dr. von Niemann and another doctor, Dr. Haupt, conclude that the death is the same as all of the previous deaths – blood loss, with two punctures in the neck caused by needle-sharp teeth. Gleib enters the examination, and upon seeing the dead body, runs away screaming.
Next morning, Glieb enters Dr. von Niemann''s garden, where Dr. von Niemann, Breettschneider and Bertin are discussing vampires inside the house. The town fathers enter the house and announce that Kringen is dead and Gleib is missing. An angry mob hunts down Gleib and chases him through the countryside and into a cave, where he falls to his death.
That night, Dr. von Niemann is seen telepathically controlling Emil Borst, as he picks up sleeping Gorgiana and takes her down to Dr. von Niemann''s laboratory, where a strange organism is seen. They then drain her blood from her neck.
Schnappmann then discovers Gorgiana''s body in her bed. Dr. von Niemann and Breettschneider investigate and find Ms Mueller''s crucifix, which Glieb handled the night Dr. von Niemann visited her. Breettschneider is becoming more convinced of the presence of vampires in the village as no other plausible explanations for the deaths can be found. As Glieb was seen in the garden that morning, the two conclude he is guilty.
Upon hearing of Glieb''s death, however, Breettschneider''s conviction is erased. Dr. von Niemann tells Breettschneider to go home and take sleeping pills, but gives him poison instead, intent on draining his blood. Bertin discovers Dr. von Niemann telepathically controlling Borst, who is at Breettschneider''s house. It is revealed that Dr. von Niemann has created an artificial lifeform and is using the blood to feed his organism. He ties Bertin up and gags her in his lab. Borst supposedly enters with Breettschneider''s body on a trolley. Dr. von Niemann walks over to Borst, who is revealed to be Breettschneider (who did not take the pills) in costume, with the real Borst on the trolley. Breettschneider pulls a gun on Dr. von Niemann and walks over to untie Bertin. Dr. von Niemann then wrestles Breettschneider, who drops the gun.

Walter determines to sabotage these plans, enticing the reluctant Hildy to cover one last story, the upcoming execution of Earl Williams (John Qualen) a shy bookkeeper convicted of murdering an African-American policeman. Walter insists Hildy and her fiancé Bruce join him for lunch. At the restaurant, Hildy insists that she and Bruce will be leaving in two hours to take a night train to Albany to be married the following day. Walter attempts to convince Bruce that Hildy is the only one who can write a story to save wrongly convicted Earl Williams. After several attempts through deceit and lies to convince Hildy to stay, Hildy eventually agrees on the condition that Walter buys a $100,000 life insurance policy from Bruce in order to receive the $1,000 commission. In the meantime, Hildy bribes the jail warden to let her interview Earl Williams in jail. Williams explains that he shot the police officer by accident. Hildy uses economic theory to explain the murder of the cop to Williams, insisting that he shot the gun because of production for use.
Walter does everything he can to keep Hildy from leaving, first setting up and accusing Bruce of stealing a watch, forcing Hildy to bail him out of jail. Exasperated, Hildy announces her retirement from her profession; however, when Williams escapes from the bumbling sheriff (Gene Lockhart) and practically falls into Hildy''s lap, the lure of a big scoop proves too much for her. Walter frames Bruce again, and he is immediately sent back to jail. At this point, she realizes that Walter is behind the shenanigans, yet is powerless to bail him out again. Williams comes to the press room holding a gun to Hildy and accidentally shoots a pigeon in fear. Hildy takes the gun from him. Bruce calls, and she tells him to wait because she has Earl Williams in the press room. Williams''s friend Mollie comes looking for him, assuring him that she knows he is innocent. When reporters knock at the door, she hides Williams in a roll-top desk. At this time, the building is surrounded by other reporters and cops looking for Williams. Hildy''s stern mother-in-law-to-be (Alma Kruger) enters berating Hildy for the way she is treating Bruce. Upon being harassed for Williams''s whereabouts by the reporters, Mollie jumps out of the window but isn''t killed. Annoyed, Walter has his colleague "Diamond Louie" (Abner Biberman) remove Mrs. Baldwin from the room "temporarily". Hildy wants to try to get Bruce out of jail, but Walter convinces her that she should focus on her breakthrough story.

Bruce comes into the press room having wired Albany for his bail asking about the whereabouts of his mother, as Hildy is frantically typing out her story. She is so consumed with writing the story that she hardly notices as Bruce realizes his cause is hopeless and leaves to return to Albany on the 9 o''clock train. "Diamond Louie" enters the room with torn clothes, revealing that he had hit a police car while driving away with Mrs. Baldwin. Louie reveals that he wasn''t sure whether or not she was killed in the accident. The crooked mayor (Clarence Kolb) and sheriff need the publicity from the execution to keep their jobs in an upcoming election, so when a messenger (Billy Gilbert) brings them a reprieve from the governor, they try to bribe the man to go away and return later, when it will be too late. Walter and Hildy find out in time to save Williams from the gallows and they use the information to blackmail the mayor and sheriff into dropping Walter''s arrest for kidnapping Mrs. Baldwin. Hildy receives one last call from Bruce, again in jail because of having counterfeit money that was unknowingly transferred to him by Hildy from Walter. Hildy breaks down and admits to Walter that she was afraid that Walter was going to let her marry Bruce without a fight. Walter and Hildy send money to bail Bruce out of jail.
Afterward, Walter tells Hildy they''re going to remarry, and promises to take her on the honeymoon they never had in Niagara Falls.

His request: to watch his three best friends, with whom he regularly played poker, for the next 24 hours. That day, each man would receive a letter; tomorrow, Max''s will is to be read.  Each letter states that he had an affair with that man''s wife, all of with whom he was close.  With one, Max attended Friday symphony matinees and had tea afterwards; with another, he went to night clubs and taught French; the last, he repeatedly hired as his nurse through his long battle with heart disease.
Each husband reacts differently, as does each wife when she discovers that something has happened to make her husband distrust her.  At the end of the 24 hours, each couple declares their intention to divorce, mistrust and disbelief having split each relationship.  The lawyer reads the will, stating that Max''s great fortune has been left to the three wives, as he believes that marriage is stronger when a wife is not dependent on her husband.  It states in his will that Max wrote the letters to show each of his friends how much his wife was worth, as each had begun to take her for granted; he believed that jealousy was the perfect motivator to make someone re-appreciate something/someone.
Each wife reiterates her intention to divorce; each husband apologizes and begs her to reconsider.  The three couples all reconcile, everyone grateful for having had Max and for his final gift to them - each other.','["Irving Reis"]','["Vera Caspary","Edward Eliscu"]','["Eve Arden","Ruth Warrick","Vanessa Brown"]','[""]','5.9','["tt0032277","tt0042182","tt0037786","tt0028662","tt0028557","tt0026333","tt9076570","tt0029662","tt0043526","tt0033646","tt0037847","tt0040868"]','["Comedy"]','[{"url":"/ThreeHusbands.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/ThreeHusbands_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','ThreeHusbands',24102,'Q7797540','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

He brings youthful industrial engineer Fred Staples, whose performance at a company Ramsey has recently acquired has impressed him, to do a top executive job at the head office. Ramsey is grooming Staples to replace the aging Bill Briggs as the second in command at the company.
Briggs has been with the firm for decades, having worked for and admired the company''s founder, Ramsey''s father. His concern for the employees clashes repeatedly with Ramsey''s ruthless methods. Ramsey will not fire Briggs outright but does everything in his power to sabotage and humiliate his subordinate into resigning. The old man stubbornly refuses to give in. Staples has mixed feelings about the messy situation, his ambition conflicting with his sympathy for Briggs.
The stress gets to Briggs, who collapses after a confrontation with Ramsey and later dies. This causes a heated showdown between Ramsey and Staples, in which Staples announces he is quitting and Ramsey says that only high performers have any right to leading posts. In the end, Ramsey persuades him to stay, telling him that he is the only one who can function at Briggs''s level and that he would not be able to reach his full potential anywhere else. Staples accepts a promotion with double his salary and stock options but warns Ramsey that he will actively work to replace him in the company.  Staples also tells Ramsey of Briggs'' "one pitiful little dream" of someday walking in and breaking Ramsey''s jaw.  He now reserves that dream for himself.  Ramsey says he''ll have it written into the contract agreement and will attach a special rider giving him the same privilege.  Ramsey notes that Briggs'' son will be "taken care of" and Staples asks if that will let him sleep better tonight.  Ramsey smiles and says, "It begins."','["Fielder Cook"]',NULL,'["Van Heflin","Everett Sloane","Ed Begley"]','["Drama"]','7.8','["tt0057700","tt0056406","tt0043938","tt0047680","tt0049652","tt0049629","tt0042707","tt0045124","tt0029658","tt0040455","tt0043142","tt0060333"]','["Drama"]','[{"url":"/PATTERNS.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/PATTERNS_201309_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','PATTERNS_201309',2652,'Q7148402','wp','["Rod Serling"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

A woman of great beauty but terrible reputation, she reveals that she is the mother of Lady Windermere, who believes she is dead and reveres her memory. Fearing that his wife would be crushed by the truth and seeing a pile of bills on Mrs. Erlynne''s desk, Lord Windermere gives her a cheque for £1500 for her silence.
Mrs. Erlynne resumes her scandalous lifestyle. At a horse race, she attracts the attention of many, including members of the Windermere party, notably Lord Augustus Lorton, "London''s most distinguished bachelor," and three snoopy, gossipy women. As Lord Windermere defends Mrs. Erlynne to the latter, his wife becomes a bit concerned. Mrs. Erlynne leaves. Lorton follows and is soon calling on her regularly.
For Lady Windermere''s birthday, her husband gives her jewelry and a lovely fan. When he leaves the mansion, she and Darlington by chance see him dismiss his chauffeur and take a taxi instead. Darlington then tells her that Mrs. Erlynne''s name may be found in her husband''s cheque book and declares his love for her. Meanwhile, Mrs. Erlynne blackmails Lord Windermere into an invitation to a ball that night, explaining that such "social recognition" might help elicit a marriage proposal from Lord Lorton. When he returns home, his wife confronts him with his copy of the £1500 cheque, which she found after breaking into his locked desk drawer. He tells her he only helped a deserving woman in need, but she becomes further infuriated when he informs her that Mrs. Erlynne will be coming to their ball that night.
Faced with his wife''s strong opposition, he sends a note to Mrs. Erlynne, asking her not to come. She does not open it, assuming it is her invitation, and goes to the ball. She is not on the guest list, but then Lord Lorton arrives, and she uses him to gain entry. She induces a reluctant Lord Windermere to formally introduce her to his wife. This awkward moment does not go unnoticed, and gossip quickly spreads. However, Mrs. Erlynne adroitly flatters the chief gossiper, and soon she is accepted by the other women guests.
Unaware of this, Lady Windermere flees to the garden. She then thinks that she sees Mrs. Erlynne flirting with her husband. In fact, she is talking to Lorton, who asks Mrs. Erlynne to marry him. Mrs. Erlynne spots Lady Windermere and tries to clear up any confusion, but Lady Windermere will not listen. Instead, she flees to Darlington''s house, though the man is still at her party. Mrs. Erlynne finds her farewell note to her husband and takes it away.
At Darlington''s house, she tries to persuade Lady Windermere to go home, telling her that she ruined her life in exactly the same manner. Then Darlington arrives, accompanied by Lord Windermere and some other men, the ball having ended. The two women hide in another room, but Lady Windermere forgets her fan on a sofa. Lord Windermere demands that Lord Darlington explain what his wife''s fan is doing there. Mrs. Erlynne comes out and apologizes for having taken it by mistake. All the guests, notably Lord Lorton, leave. Meanwhile, Lady Windermere leaves the house unseen.
The following day at breakfast, Mrs. Erlynne comes to return the fan and take leave of the Windermeres, as she is going back to France. Lady Windermere wants to tell her husband what really happened the day before, but Mrs. Erlynne dissuades her. On her way out, Mrs. Erlynne encounters Lord Lorton and tells him that she was shocked by his behavior the previous evening and that she no longer wants to marry him. He is flabbergasted, but after thinking it over, follows her into her taxi.','["Ernst Lubitsch"]','["Oscar Wilde","Julien Josephson"]','["Irene Rich","May McAvoy","Bert Lytell"]','[""]','7.3','["tt0015119","tt0018451","tt0023303","tt0020112","tt0021153","tt0022074","tt0011960","tt0023940","tt0031725","tt0028575","tt0014624","tt0029929"]','["Silent; Comedy; Drama"]','[{"url":"/LadyWindermeresFan_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/LadyWindermeresFan_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','LadyWindermeresFan',20456,'Q126135','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Diane is courted by her uncle''s associate, Dr. Erik Engstrom (Sten Gester), though she aggressively plays hard-to-get, at first. A romance develops, and eventually their journey is interrupted by the news of a large herd of mutilated reindeer in Lapland. Both scientists immediately fly there, far north in the Arctic mountains of Lapland, near the site of the meteorite crash. To the irritation of both scientists, Diane stows away aboard their aircraft. When they arrive, the meteorite is actually determined to be a round alien spaceship, and she suddenly realizes just how dangerous a decision she has made.
An enormously tall, hairy biped creature, with powerful jaws, tusks, and large round feet, under the control of three humanoid aliens in the spaceship, comes out of nowhere and begins menacing the scientists and the native Laplanders. The tall beast destroys the scientists'' aircraft, killing the soldier guarding it, and begins tearing apart Laplander houses with its bare hands. As Dr. Engstrom and Diane are trying to ski away to safety, the hairy monster attacks again and is able to capture Diane. She screams and faints.
Meanwhile, a search party has been formed, now carrying torches as night begins to fall. They hear Diane''s screams and go toward the sound. Dr. Engstrom arrives and watches as the hairy monster carries her off. He hurries toward the torch-carrying Laplanders and tries to alert Dr. Wilson, who is with them, that the creature now has Diane. Carrying her to the snow-buried alien spaceship, the extraterrestrial monster suddenly begins displaying tenderness toward his captive, a result of mind control exerted over the creature by the humanoid aliens. She runs into an adjoining ice cave and screams and faints again when the aliens come near. The aliens leave the cave and see the mass of lighted torches coming their way. The hairy monster picks up Diane and heads away from the buried spaceship.
The Laplanders give chase and are finally able to confront the huge creature, who is now standing with its back to the edge of a deep snow cliff. Angry villagers begin throwing their fire torches, and the tall monster carefully places Diane on the ground, where she is able to roll a few feet away. More torches are thrown and the hairy creature catches on fire, falling backward over the cliff to a fiery death down below. The aliens take off in their spaceship, returning the way they came.

('tt0028827','free','Elephant Boy (1937)','1937','1h 20min','Toomai (Sabu), a young boy growing up in India, longs to become a hunter. In the meantime, he helps his mahout (elephant driver) father with Kala Nag, a large elephant that has been in their family for four generations.
Petersen (Walter Hudd) hires the father and Kala Nag, among others, for a large annual government roundup of wild elephants to be tamed and put to work. Amused by Toomai and learning that he has no one but his father to look after him, Petersen allows the boy to come too.
Strangely, no elephants have been seen in the region in a while, so Petersen has staked his reputation on a guess that they will be found further north. However, six weeks of hunting prove fruitless. He is ready to give up, but his right-hand man, Machua Appa (Allan Jeayes), persuades him to keep hunting for another month. When the other hired natives learn of Toomai''s ambition, they mock him, telling him that he will become a hunter only when he sees the elephants dance (a myth).
One night, Toomai''s father spots a tiger prowling near the camp and wakes Petersen. When the two go out to shoot the beast, Toomai''s father is killed. Kala Nag''s grief becomes so intense, he rampages through the camp, only stopping when Toomai calms him down.
Petersen decides to assign cruel Rham Lahl (Bruce Gordon) to Kala Nag, as Toomai is too young for the job. When Rham Lahl beats the elephant, however, Kala Nag injures his tormenter. The mahout insists that Kala Nag be destroyed, as is the law. Petersen manages to get him to change his mind and accept 100 rupees instead by threatening to have him removed from the safety of the camp.
Unaware of this reprieve, Toomai takes Kala Nag and runs away into the jungle. There, they stumble upon the missing wild elephants, and Toomai sees them dancing. He leads Petersen to them. The other natives are awed, and hail him as "Toomai of the Elephants". Machua Appa offers to train the boy to become a hunter, a plan Petersen approves of.',NULL,'["Rudyard Kipling","John Collier"]','["Sabu","W.E.

"It''s nine" the Italian-American janitor Luigi Bacciagalupi (Luis Alberni) answers and wants to know from which apartment he came out. The man leaves without answering. Short after the janitor finds a dead man in the office of "Garfield Investment Company". Newspaperman Burton (Theodore Newton) from the Chronicle is there to talk with the inspector. Before he can see him he talks with the watching police officer, and after a while, realizes that the Garfield Investment Company just that morning went bankrupt.

During the trial he sticks to what he has seen and what he has heard, though two different doctors testify that Mr. Breed is deaf and mute since birth.
Young chronicle newspaperman Jerry Crane, in love with his good-looking girl colleague, has a feeling that Breed is a strange guy and tries to convince her not to go for interview to his house. Meantime a young broker tells him he has a hint, if he gets enough money for it. Breed comes to see the young broker before at half past eight the Burton comes to his house. A second time Mr. Breed asks for the time after seeing his victim. The puzzling case has the parallel love story of the two newspaper-people of the Chronicle.

She is prepared to let him drown until Judge Saladine (Alan Napier) happens by, at which point Jenny jumps into the water and takes credit for saving the boy''s life.
About ten years later, Jenny (Hedy Lamarr) has grown up to be a beautiful but equally heartless and manipulative young woman. Her father, an abusive, drunken widower, whips Jenny after learning of her flirtation with a sailor. She secretly schemes to wed the richest man in town, the much older timber baron Isaiah Poster (Gene Lockhart), while his son Ephraim (Louis Hayward) is away at college in Cambridge.
Poster is unkind to his mild-mannered son upon Ephraim''s return. He is unaware that the boy and Jenny were once sweethearts and that Jenny is again flirting with Ephraim behind her husband''s back. Poster is more concerned about the lawlessness in town, lumberjacks drunkenly pillaging the town, manhandling the women and killing the judge, confirming Poster''s long-held belief that Bangor must organize a police force.
Jenny secretly hopes that her husband will die after he falls ill. When he recovers, Poster must make a trip to his lumber camps. Jenny appeals to Ephraim to arrange his father''s death, saying, "I want you to return alone." In the rapids, both men fall from an overturned canoe and Poster drowns. His son, still deathly afraid of water, is unable or unwilling to save him.
To his shock, Ephraim returns to Jenny telling him, "You can''t come into this house, you wretched coward...You''ve killed your father." He becomes a hopeless drunk, hating her and speaking freely about her deceitful ways. Poster''s superintendent in the timber business, John Evered (George Sanders), goes to confront Ephraim but isn''t sure whether to believe the harsh words he hears about Jenny.
Jenny proceeds to seduce Evered, who is engaged to marry her best friend, Meg Saladine (Hillary Brooke), the judge''s daughter. Lust overtakes them during a thunderstorm. After their wedding, Evered is eager to have children, but Jenny learns she cannot bear any. She confesses this to her new husband after some delay, fearful of his rejection of her, but to Jenny''s relief, John wholeheartedly affirms his love.
A traveling evangelist, Lincoln Pettridge (Edward Biby), preaches fire and brimstone that results in Jenny''s searing confession to her husband that all Ephraim had said about her was true. Evered goes off to be by himself at a lumber camp, and Jenny learns that Meg has gone to see Evered there.  In the cabin, knowing of his love for Jenny, Meg tells him to go back to his wife. Jenny pulls up to the cabin right afterward and, seeing them together frantically whips her horse, bearing down on them with her carriage. It hits a rock, careens off a cliff and Jenny is mortally wounded. Her dying words are an expression of her passionate feelings for John, who has let her know true love.',NULL,'["Herb Meadow","Ben Ames Williams"]','["Hedy Lamarr","George Sanders","Louis Hayward"]','["Drama","Film-Noir","Romance","Thriller"]','6.7','["tt0039324","tt0038126","tt0034622","tt0042664","tt0029855","tt0039101","tt0036719","tt0035980","tt0033477","tt0022867","tt0040751","tt0036807"]','["logging;Maine;George Sanders;Hedy Lamarr;Moroni Olsen;Alan Napier;Ben Ames Williams"]','[{"url":"/Strange_Woman.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Strange_Woman_1946.mp4","format":"MPEG4"},{"url":"/Strange_Woman_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/Strange_Woman_movie_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','Strange_Woman_movie',38133,'Q2264826','wp',NULL,'["Edgar G.

The cemetery caretaker, Andy MacKee (Bikel), keeps a map in the cemetery office displaying the grounds and each gravesite. Filled graves are marked by black pins and unoccupied but sold graves are marked with white pins. New to the position and unobservant, Kraft accidentally places a pair of black pins where they don''t belong, only to discover later that the young couple who had bought the grave sites in question died in an automobile accident soon afterwards. He believes that he marked them for death.
Hoping it will give him peace of mind, Robert replaces a random white pin with a black pin. When that person dies later in the week, however, he becomes increasingly convinced that either he or the map wield some kind of dark power. Repeated experiments, undertaken upon the insistence of skeptical friends and co-workers, yield the same result. Kraft slips into deep guilt and depression and believes he is cursed.
The police, who are initially skeptical, eventually begin to take notice and, in the hopes that it will reveal the cause of the deaths, ask Robert to place a black pin on the grave of a person who is known to be in France. Although he does so, Robert continues his slide into despair. That same night, he decides that if black pins give him the power of death, white pins might give him the power of life. He replaces all of the recently placed black pins with white pins. When he goes to the associated grave sites later that night, he discovers that they have all been dug up, with the bodies gone.
Upon returning to the cemetery office, Robert receives a call informing him of the death of the man in France. As he hangs up the phone, the cemetery caretaker comes up behind him, covered in dirt.

The stress of the mission causes him to have a mental breakdown, so his assistant, Dr. Paul Nakamura (Yagi), suggests he takes a vacation in Japan at his abandoned luxury resort to recuperate. Dr. Bragan accepts his offer and flies to Japan.
In Japan, Dr. Bragan stays at the defunct hotel of Nakamura with Dr. Noriko Hanamura (Kami), the lovely daughter of his coworker who takes on the role of his assistant. Bragan begins a bizarre experiment in botany in the hotel''s secluded greenhouse to prove his theory that humans evolved from plants. With a potted Venus flytrap he brought from America, the scientist grafts it to a Japanese carnivorous oceanic plant to create a hybrid creature that becomes humanoid and requires the blood of mammals to flourish. But Bragan is just as obsessive and moody as he was in America, and his behavior causes Noroko to suspect he is going mad, especially when he secretly takes a victim''s "heart blood" to feed it. When his creation, "Sectovorus" uproots and begins moving around on its own, it becomes dangerous and it''s not long before the creature begins seeking human victims from a nearby village. The villagers riot and Dr. Bragan must decide between protecting his creation or killing it in order to save mankind. He opts to lure it into a nearby volcano.','["Norman Earl Thomson"]',NULL,'["James Craig","Tota Kondo","Lawrence O''Neill"]','[""]','2.8','["tt6389716","tt0063255","tt0065456","tt0051434","tt0068313","tt0064687","tt0077640","tt0132888","tt0099577","tt0350184","tt0065727","tt0067948"]','["full movie ; venus flytrap ; japan ; Frankenstein ; experiments ; plants ;"]','[{"url":"/TheRevengeOfDr.X.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/TheRevengeOfDr.X_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/TheRevengeOfDr.X_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','TheRevengeOfDr.X',28108,'Q7920588','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Landry is waiting for the return of Conrad as they plan to marry. Alma also loves Conrad. Larry, Alma''s step brother, attempts to woo Sylvia but is rebuffed. Larry kills a professional gambler during a game of poker. Alma arranges for Sylvia to be caught in a compromising situation by Conrad when he returns. Conrad begins to strangle Sylvia but is stopped by Alma. Conrad leaves for Brazil. Sylvia returns to the South.

Sylvia meets Rev. Jacobs, a minister who runs a rural school for black children called Piney Woods School. The school is overcrowded, and Rev. Jacobs cannot continue on the small amount offered to blacks for education by the state. With the school facing closure, Sylvia volunteers to return to the North to raise $5,000.
Sylvia''s purse is stolen in Boston. Dr. Vivian chases after the thief and recovers the purse. After being hit by a car that stemmed from saving a young child playing in the street, Sylvia meets the owner of the car as she recovers in the hospital. The owner is Elena Warwick, a wealthy philanthropist. Learning of Sylvia''s mission, she decides to give her the needed money. When her Southern friend Mrs. Stratton tries to discourage her, Warwick increases her donation to $50,000. This amount will save the school and Sylvia returns to the South.
Rev. Jacobs asks for Sylvia''s hand in marriage but Sylvia, now in love with Dr. Vivian, refuses. Larry, on the run from the police, runs into Sylvia and attempts blackmail with secrets of Sylvia''s past. Instead of stealing from the school on Larry''s behalf, Sylvia steals away in the night and heads north.
Later, Dr. Vivian searches for Sylvia. Larry, who has run out of money and returned to Alma, is fatally shot during an attempted bank robbery. Dr. Vivian by chance ends up treating Larry and meets Alma. Alma tells Dr. Vivian about Sylvia''s past: these flashback scenes are portrayed in the film. Sylvia was adopted and raised by a poor black family, the Landrys, who managed to provide her with an education.

During her youth, the senior Landry was wrongfully accused of the murder of an unpopular but wealthy white landlord, Gridlestone. A white mob attacked the Landry family, lynching the parents and hunting down their son, who escaped after nearly being shot. The mob also lynched Efrem, a servant of Gridlestone. Sylvia escaped after being chased by Gridlestone''s brother, who was close to raping her. Noticing a scar on her breast, Gridlestone''s brother realized that Sylvia was his mixed-race daughter, born of his marriage to a local black woman. He had paid for her education.
After hearing about her life, Dr. Vivian meets with Sylvia; he encourages her to love her country and take pride in the contributions of African Americans. He professes his love for her, and the film ends with their marriage.','["Oscar Micheaux"]',NULL,'["Evelyn Preer","Flo Clements","James D.

In 1588, relations between Spain and England are at breaking point. With the support of Queen Elizabeth I (Flora Robson), English privateers such as Sir Francis Drake regularly capture Spanish merchantmen bringing gold from the New World.
Elizabeth''s chief advisers are the Lord Treasurer, Lord Burleigh (Morton Selten), and her longtime admirer, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester (Leslie Banks). Burleigh''s 18-year-old granddaughter Cynthia (Vivien Leigh) is one of Elizabeth''s ladies-in-waiting, and the ageing queen is plagued by jealousy of the girl''s beauty and vivacity.
In a sea battle between the Spanish, led by Don Miguel (Robert Rendel), and the English, led by his old friend Sir Richard Ingolby (Lyn Harding) the English are captured. Miguel allows Richard''s son Michael (Laurence Olivier) to escape. Michael swims ashore on Miguel''s estate, and his wounds are tended to by Miguel''s daughter Elena (Tamara Desni), who quickly becomes enamoured of the handsome Englishman, despite her being engaged to marry. As the months pass, Michael recovers and laments being apart from Cynthia, his sweetheart, but is nonetheless impressed by Elena''s charms.
Miguel brings Michael the sad news that Sir Richard, his father, has been executed as a heretic. The grieving Michael denounces his rescuers and flees to England in a small fishing boat. When he is granted an audience with the Queen he urges her to fight the Spanish menace by whatever means necessary, and swears undying loyalty to her. Elizabeth is flattered by the young man''s fervent devotion and later has an opportunity to take advantage of his offer of service when Hillary Vane (James Mason), an Englishman spying for Spain, is killed before the names of his English co-conspirators can be uncovered.
Michael, disguised as Vane, goes to the court of King Philip II of Spain (Raymond Massey) to get the letters that will set into motion a plan to assassinate Elizabeth. At the palace Michael meets Elena.  Her father has been killed by the English and she is now married to Don Pedro (Robert Newton), the palace governor. Elena keeps Michael''s identity a secret as long as she can, but finally must tell her husband out of loyalty to him.
Philip sees through Michael''s disguise and orders his arrest. Pedro helps him escape so that it will not be discovered that his wife aided a heretic. While Michael is returning home, the Spanish Armada sails against England and Elizabeth addresses her army at Tilbury. Michael meets her there and reveals the names of the traitors. Elizabeth knights Michael before confronting the six traitors, inviting them to fulfill their plot and kill her. Overwhelmed with shame, they agree to accompany Michael on a mission to deploy fire ships in a night attack on the Armada, massed off the coast of England.
The tactic succeeds, and Elizabeth allows Michael and Cynthia to be wed.','["William K. Howard"]','["A.E.W.

The women sympathize with Evelyn, knowing of the hard life she has had. Evelyn has bouts of hysteria, involving her fear of birds, and also keeps a secret diary in which she mocks her fiancé Dan and expresses a desire for Douglas instead.
While plotting to seduce Douglas, and accusing Dan of jealousy to make him leave, Evelyn next sets out to rid the house of Miriam, whom she sees as a rival. Her gossip succeeds in getting back to Aunt Martha and turning everyone''s suspicions to Miriam, who departs.
Douglas then quarrels with Ann, driven apart by Evelyn''s diabolical schemes. Evelyn goes so far as to destroy the goodbye note Ann has written to him. By the time everyone realizes who''s behind all this and decide to commit Evelyn to an asylum, a hysterical Evelyn flees from the house, screaming, and plunges to her death.',NULL,'["Ketti Frings","Hagar Wilde"]','["Anne Baxter","Ralph Bellamy","Aline MacMahon"]','["Drama","Film-Noir"]','6.2','["tt0049621","tt0043390","tt0040472","tt0039730","tt0039101","tt0038346","tt0039986","tt0049857","tt0041631","tt0041187","tt0039324","tt0042544"]','["Anne Baxter; Ralph Bellamy; Aline MacMahon; Ruth Warrick; Scott McKay; Marie McDonald; Jerome Cowan; Margaret Hamilton; Percy Kilbride; Connie Laird; Mystic Nights Videos"]','[{"url":"/GuestInTheHouse1944.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/GuestInTheHouse1944_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/GuestInTheHouse1944_573_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','GuestInTheHouse1944_573',14066,'Q5615123','wp',NULL,'["John Brahm","John Cromwell"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Their old vehicle has broken down, causing a traffic jam.  Stuck in the traffic jam are John Blair and his wife, who were on their way to meet an old family friend at the train station, Richard Williams.  When the Blairs do not show up, he makes his own way to their house, where he meets their daughter, Jean, who was also his childhood sweetheart.  The two reignite their old flame, much to the chagrin of Ralph Crawford, who has been attempting to woo Jean himself.
That night, prior to attending a meeting at their lodge, the Mystic Knights of the Sea, they are hired to transport Duke Ellington and His Cotton Club band to a party being given at the Blair estate.  While they are on their way, Richard is confiding to John Blair his feelings for his daughter, and also stating that he has no intention of pursuing Jean unless he can afford to start his own business to support them.  After the death of his father, Richard''s family lost all their money.  He has come up to New York because his grandfather used to own a large home in Harlem, and he hopes to be able to find the deed to it, in order to sell it for the money needed to start his business. He thinks the deed must be hidden somewhere on the property itself. Unknown to Blair or Richard, is that Ralph is eavesdropping on their conversation.
After his discussion with Blair, Richard runs into Amos and Andy, who used to work for his father down south, and they are all happy to see one another.  Having delivered their fare, the two cab drivers rush back to town to attend their lodge meeting.  The lodge has an annual tradition where a pair of members must spend a night in a haunted house in Harlem, and find a document labeled, "Check and Double Check".  Once they find it, they are to replace it, in a different location, with their own version, for the lodge members to find the following year. The haunted house in question in none other than the house previously owned by Richard''s grandfather.
As Amos and Andy are searching for their document, Ralph is also in the house with several of his cohorts, searching for the deed, in order to thwart Richard''s chances with Jean.  Amos and Andy find their document, but then realize they did not bring any other paper to write their message on and secrete for their lodge brothers.  In searching for something to write on, they stumble on the deed to premises.  As they are about to write their message on the back, they are interrupted by Ralph and his friends, who believe that the two have found the deed.  In the confusion which ensues, the cab drivers hand over what everyone believes is the deed, before they scamper out of the building.  However, when they return to the lodge, they realize that they had given the Check and Double Check paper to Ralph, instead of the deed.  They do not know the importance of the document they have, but they recognized Richard''s grandfather''s signature on it, and intend to deliver it to Richard the following day.
After failing to find the deed, a heartbroken Richard leaves for the railway station, intending to return home.  Amos and Andy arrive at the Blair house too late to give him the deed, but race to the station and are able to hand over the deed just before Richard''s train leaves.  Now with the deed, Richard can sell the house, open his business, and marry Jean.','["Melville W. Brown"]','["Bert Kalmar","Harry Ruby"]','["Freeman F. Gosden","Charles J.

Thor (Bryan Grant) shows his alien contempt for Earth''s creatures by vaporizing a dog named Sparky. Crew member Derek (David Love), after discovering an inscription on Sparky''s dog tag, fears that the Gargon might destroy Earth''s native inhabitants. This makes the other aliens scoff at the thought. Being members of the "supreme race", they disdain "foreign beings", no matter how intelligent; they pride themselves that "families" and "friendships" are forbidden on their world. Derek turns out to be a member of an alien underground that commemorates the more humane periods of their world''s history.
Their one Gargon seems to be sick in Earth''s atmosphere. While his crew mates are distracted, Derek leaves. Eventually, the Gargon seems to revive. When the Captain reports his actions, Derek is quickly connected to their Leader (Gene Sterling); Derek, it turns out, is the Leader''s son, although Derek is unaware of this. Thor is sent to hunt down Derek, with orders to kill him in order to protect their mission to Earth. They return to their base, leaving the Gargon behind.
Meanwhile, Derek finds the home address he found on the dog''s tag. There he meets Betty Morgan (Dawn Anderson) and her Grandpa Joe (Harvey B. Dunn). They have a room to rent, and Derek inadvertently becomes a boarder. When Betty''s boyfriend, reporter Joe Rogers (Tom Graeff), cannot make their afternoon date, Derek tags along with Betty. He shows the tag to Betty, who recognizes it immediately. Derek takes her to the place where the spaceship landed and shows her Sparky''s remains. She does not believe him, so he describes Thor''s weapon that can also vaporize humans. Betty takes this surprisingly well and vows to help Derek stop his crewmate.
For the rest of the day, Betty and Derek have several run-ins with Thor, and Joe follows up on stories of skeletons popping up all over town. Eventually, Thor is wounded, and he kidnaps Betty to help him receive medical attention, in the process revealing Derek''s true parentage to her. Two car chases and a gunfight follow, and Thor is finally captured by Earth authorities after plummeting off a cliff in a stolen car.
But there are bigger problems: the Gargon has grown immensely large in Earth''s atmosphere, killing a policeman investigating the alien''s landing site, and attacking numerous people. Derek and Betty go to the car wreck site to look for Thor''s raygun. They share a kiss, and Derek vows to stay on Earth. When the Gargon ruins their romantic moment, Derek finds the raygun just in time for them to be able to escape. Unfortunately, it is out of power and the enlarged Gargon is heading toward town. They follow and confront it, having used the overhead power lines to fuel the raygun''s disintegrator ray. They eventually kill the creature, but it is too late. Alien spaceships suddenly appear in orbit overhead.
The whole gang, including Joe and Grandpa, hurries to the alien landing site. Derek reunites with his father and makes the ultimate sacrifice, leading the overhead spaceships at full speed directly into his ground location, causing a massive explosion. Derek does not survive the blast but is remembered by Betty for declaring, "I shall make the Earth my home.

('tt0034928','free','Jungle Book (1942)','1942','1h 48min','In an Indian village, Buldeo, an elderly storyteller, is paid by a visiting British memsahib to tell a story of his youth. He speaks of the animals of the jungle and of the ever-present threats to human life posed by the jungle itself. He then recalls his earlier life:
As a younger man he dreams that his village could one day become an important town and that the jungle could be conquered. However, when he is speaking about these dreams, an attack by Shere Khan, the tiger, leads to the death of a man and the loss of the man''s child. The child is adopted by wolves in the jungle and grows to be the wild youth Mowgli. Years later, Mowgli is captured by the villagers and taken in by his mother Messua, though she does not recognize him as her lost child. He learns to speak and tries to imitate the ways of men, as well as becomes friendly with Buldeo''s daughter, Mahala – much to Buldeo''s distress, since he is convinced that the wild Mowgli is dangerous. When Mowgli and Mahala explore the jungle, they discover a hidden chamber in a ruined palace, containing fabulous wealth. Warned by an aged cobra that the wealth brings death, they leave, but Mahala takes one coin as a memento. When Buldeo sees the coin, he tries to force Mowgli to tell him where the treasure is, but Mowgli refuses. Buldeo resolves to follow Mowgli to the site of the treasure.
Later Mowgli fights and kills Shere Khan, with some last minute help from Kaa, the python. As he is skinning the body, Buldeo arrives. He threatens Mowgli with a gun, but is attacked by Mowgli''s friend Bagheera, the black panther. Buldeo becomes convinced that Bagheera is Mowgli himself, shape-shifted into panther form. He tells the villagers that Mowgli is a witch, as is his mother. Mowgli is chained up and threatened with death, but escapes with his mother''s help. However, she and another villager who tries to defend her are tied up and themselves threatened with burning for witchcraft.
Mowgli is followed by the greedy Buldeo and two friends, a priest and a barber, to the lost city. They find the treasure (including a golden elephant goad with a big ruby intact) and leave for the village with as much as they can carry. But when they stop for the night, the priest tries to steal the goad from the barber''s share and murders him when the barber wakes up. The priest unconvincingly tells Buldeo that the barber had attacked him and that he had killed in self-defense, but Buldeo knows better. The next day, the priest attacks Buldeo while his back is turned, but Buldeo knocks him into the swamp where he is killed by a crocodile. Mowgli, who''d been trailing the men, tells Bagheera to chase Buldeo, the sole survivor, from the jungle, and Buldeo flees for his life, jettisoning the treasure he''d been carrying.
Enraged and maddened, Buldeo tries to murder Mowgli and even the jungle itself, by starting a forest fire. The fire rages, but the wind turns and threatens the village. The villagers flee, but Mowgli''s mother and her defender are trapped. Mowgli brings the elephants to the village and breaks open the building, escaping to the river with his mother, Mahala and other villagers. He is invited to follow them to a new life downriver, but refuses to leave the jungle, turning back to help animals trapped by the fire.
The scene returns to the present day, with the elderly Buldeo telling his story and admitting that the jungle defeated his youthful dreams, and because of his actions his reputation was destroyed. When asked what became of Mowgli and his daughter, as well as how he escaped from the fire himself, he looks into the camera and says that is another story.','["Zoltan Korda"]',NULL,'["Sabu","Joseph Calleia","John Qualen"]','["Action","Adventure","Family"]','6.7','["tt0033152","tt0910908","tt0110213","tt0028827","tt0061852","tt0283426","tt0053994","tt0048250","tt1075333","tt0031580","tt0042998","tt0024264"]','["Fantasy; Action; Adventure; Sabu Dastagir;pdmovies"]','[{"url":"/JungleBook_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/Jungle_Book.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/Jungle_Book_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"}]','JungleBook',775821,'Q1167592','wp','["Laurence Stallings"]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

He and three confederates bury the stolen treasure on a remote island. He then presents himself at the court of William III of England (Henry Daniell) as an honest shipmaster seeking a royal commission as a privateer after striking his colors to a pirate. The king is persuaded by Kidd that the captain of The Twelve Apostles was that pirate, who has disappeared with its treasure. The King grants the commission. 
Kidd recruits a crew from condemned pirates in Newgate and Marshalsea prisons, promising them a royal pardon at the end of their voyage. Among them is the quarrelsome though cultured Adam Mercy (Randolph Scott). Kidd makes him the new master gunner because of his claimed prior service with pirate Captain Avery.
The King sends Kidd and his ship the Adventure Galley to the waters near Madagascar to rendezvous with the ship Quedagh Merchant and provide an escort back to England. The Quedagh Merchant carries Lord Fallsworth (an uncredited Lumsden Hare), the King''s ambassador to the Grand Mughal, his daughter Lady Anne Dunstan (Barbara Britton), and a chest of treasure from the Indian potentate to King William.
Kidd''s story about a pirate he fought nearby persuades Lord Fallsworth to switch ships with his daughter and the precious cargo. Kidd''s navigator Jose Lorenzo (Gilbert Roland) lights a candle in the ship''s magazine. Just as the transfer takes place, the Quedagh Merchant blows up. Kidd also arranges a fatal "accident" for Lord Fallsworth, leaving only a frightened Lady Anne. She turns to the only man she thinks she can trust, Shadwell (Reginald Owen), Kidd''s servant. When she mentions the recent battle with pirates, Shadwell tells her it never happened. He advises her to put her faith in Adam Mercy.
On the voyage home, Kidd schemes to rid himself of his three close associates (to avoid sharing the booty) and Mercy (whom he suspects of being a spy). Mercy is really the vengeance-seeking son of Admiral Lord Blayne, the slandered captain of The Twelve Apostles. When a smitten Lorenzo tries to force himself on Lady Anne, Kidd is delighted when Mercy engages him in a sword fight. Lorenzo is driven overboard to drown. During the fight, Mercy''s medallion is torn from his neck. Kidd finds it and recognizes the Blayne family crest.
Kidd drops anchor at a lagoon. He, Orange Povey (John Carradine), his only surviving confederate (protected by an incriminating letter that will be sent to the crown authorities if he should die), and Mercy go ashore and dig up the loot from The Twelve Apostles. When Mercy sees the Blayne crest, a fight breaks out. Outnumbered, Mercy is knocked unconscious, falls into the water and does not resurface. With the others believing him dead, he swims secretly back to the ship. Mercy and a loyal crewman (John Qualen) row Lady Anne away in the ship''s jolly boat, but are spotted. Shadwell sacrifices himself needlessly to cover their escape, and Kidd blows up the jolly boat.
Believing himself safe, Kidd appears before King William with the Mughal''s treasure to claim his reward (Lord Blayne''s aristocratic title and estate).

With government restrictions on rubber in place due to the war, Gilin goes into business stealing and re-selling good tires, then sells tires retreaded with cheap synthetic rubber to used-car lots.
One of Gilin''s retreads blows out and causes the death of Mary''s brother. Bill and his co-workers become determined to find the culprit behind the shoddy tires. Gilin worries that his scheme will be discovered after Bill traces a tire to his lot.
Nikki is pressured by Gilin to accept a date with Bill, but pretends not to be able to reach him, then secretly warns Mary of Gilin''s intentions. However, Bill goes to see Nikki, intending to ask her about the tire, and falls right into Gilin''s trap.
Gilin knocks Bill out and plans to kill him. Tom comes back from the army on leave, and refuses to help his old boss when he learns that Gilin is a war profiteer.

The pilot, American John MacLaren, disengages the capsule and returns to Earth. The atomic booster, however, continues on, eventually exploding in the Delta asteroid cluster. When MacLaren insists on staying at Cape Shark to help, his homesick wife Mary takes their son and leaves for the U.S. without him.
Engineer Peter Leduq, a boastful ladies'' man, makes a bet that he can thaw frigid co-worker Katie Dandridge with a kiss within six days, unaware she can hear him over the intercom. She rebuffs his initial efforts but allows him to kiss her while they are working an all-nighter to calculate the results of the rocket''s explosion. When she belatedly remembers his amorousness is motivated by a bet, she is heartbroken, not realizing he has developed genuine feelings for her.
The rocket explosion dislodges the asteroids from their orbits. They coalesce into one giant cluster heading for Earth. To make matters worse, scientists find that the cluster will pass the Moon, causing tidal effects which will flood coastal regions. As the cluster approaches it causes worldwide disasters: tidal waves, wind, firestorms and earthquakes. Mass evacuations lead to panic and riots.
While searching for a solution, Dandridge cracks under the pressure and Leduq takes over her shift for her, exposing his sensitive and supportive side to her. At the eleventh hour, MacLaren comes up with the idea of arming every missile on earth with a nuclear warhead and firing them all at the cluster. Due to the climate change wrought by the cluster, Cape Shark''s air conditioning must remain at maximum power to keep the temperature low enough for the base''s calculator to determine all the firing data. MacLaren is reunited with his family. Mary explains that they were waiting until the last minute to board the plane in hopes that he would join them, and so heard the announcement of the asteroid disaster and headed back to Cape Shark.
Scientist Dr. Randowsky becomes convinced that the chaos caused by the cluster is divine punishment for mankind''s use of nuclear missiles. He disables the air conditioning unit, thus rendering the calculator inoperative, and uses a gun to hold off anyone who approaches to restore it. MacLaren, Leduq, and MacLaren''s friend Herbert Weisser rush Randowsky, and Weisser is fatally shot. Randowsky runs out of ammunition and, while fleeing from MacLaren and Leduq, accidentally electrocutes himself. The calculator is restarted, and the last of the firing data is transmitted. The missiles are launched, destroying the cluster and saving Earth.',NULL,'["Virgilio Sabel","Marcello Coscia"]','["Paul Hubschmid","Madeleine Fischer","Fiorella Mari"]','[""]','4.3','["tt0049429","tt0057603","tt0055178","tt0052667","tt0059045","tt0055022","tt0052782","tt0053800","tt0057443","tt3420392","tt0052604","tt0058618"]','["Science Fiction; disaster movie; Paul Hubschmid; Paolo Heusch; Mario Bava; Carlo Rustichell; Samuel Z.

Its western summit is called the Masai ''Ngje Ngi,'' the House of God. Close to the western summit there is the dried and frozen carcass of a leopard. No one has explained what the leopard was seeking at that altitude."The story centers on the memories of disillusioned writer, Harry Street, who is on safari in Africa. He has a severely infected wound from a thorn prick, and lies outside his tent awaiting a slow death, though in the film it is pointed out he may have acquired the infection from leaping into a muddy river to rescue one of the safari''s porters from a hippo after he falls in the river. His female companion, Helen, nurses Harry and hunts game for the larder.
The loss of mobility brings self-reflection. In an often delirious state he remembers his past relationship with Cynthia Green, whom he met in Paris as members of the "Lost Generation."  Upon the sale of Harry''s first novel, rather than rent a nicer home, Harry wishes to go on safari to Africa. There he has his happiest moments, including bagging a rhino. Cynthia is pregnant, but worries about sharing this news with Harry, who is passionate about his travels and work as a journalist and author. Harry only learns about the pregnancy after her miscarriage.  Suffering depression and sinking into alcoholism, she eventually leaves Harry for a flamenco dancer when she believes Harry is off for a job as a war correspondent.
Harry later becomes engaged to the wealthy and socially connected Countess Elizabeth, whom he meets on the Cote d''Azur; however, he still remains loyal to the memory of Cynthia.  On the eve of their wedding, a drunken Elizabeth confronts Harry with a letter to Harry sent from Cynthia, who is  now in Madrid. Elizabeth destroys the letter in front of Harry who stalks off to go to Spain. Unable to find Cynthia at the Madrid address on the envelope, he enlists to fight in the Spanish Civil War. During a battle he meets Cynthia, who is now an ambulance driver. Cynthia is mortally wounded, and Harry is shot and wounded when he deserts the battle to try to bring the dying Cynthia to a doctor.
Harry returns to Paris. While he is standing on the bridge watching the river, he meets Helen, who reminds him of Cynthia. After the death of his beloved mentor Uncle Bill, Harry receives as a bequest a letter from his uncle that gives him the riddle of the leopard. Harry''s bartender suggests that the leopard ended up there as he was on a false scent and became lost, but Harry takes Helen on a safari to Kenya to learn the answer of the riddle. He is injured and develops an infection. As Harry nears death, the protective Helen fights off a witch doctor.  Following the directions in an emergency first aid manual, she opens Harry''s wound to release the infection. At the dawn a medical party arrives by airplane. The vultures and hyena who have been awaiting Harry''s death leave and never return.

During his escape, he finds the body of a murdered minister.  Searching the corpse, Ernie discovers a letter from a town who have invited the deceased man sight unseen to be their town minister. Ernie appropriates the victim''s clothes and belongings to escape his pursuers and vows revenge on the minister''s murderer.
Welcomed to town, Ernie''s first action is to preside over a funeral of Sam Underwood, a man murdered on the orders of town boss Mr. Ross. Attracted to Underwood''s daughter, Ernie decides to stay, using his gunfighter skills to stand up to Ross.
Ernie is disgusted by the cowardice of the townspeople, dismissing Ross''s men as mere cowboys wearing pistols as opposed to professional gunfighters. With his men cowed by the preacher''s gunfighting skills, Ross hires a professional gunfighter to kill him. The two hold a duel in the center of town. When both miss each other at close range, the gunfighter takes it as a sign and leaves.
Parsons is ambushed by Ross''s men and dragged through the desert and left for dead. He is found in the desert and brought back to the Underwood''s home. Parsons arranges for a fake burial and takes to the hills, attacking Ross''s men through surprise attacks. Eventually, Parsons is persuaded to head back to town.
Parsons holds a service at church and is interrupted by Ross, who pretends to arrange a truce. The next day, Ross and his men come to town to ambush Parsons. Parsons asks for the help of men from the church, but they are too scared to help. When Parsons takes on Ross and his men alone, some of the men come to his aid.

After relieving the ship and crew of valuables, the pirates fire the ship, blowing up the gunpowder on board, sinking her. While the pirates celebrate, two survivors wash up on an island, an old man and his son. Before dying, the older man gives his signet ring to his son (Douglas Fairbanks). His son buries him, vowing vengeance.
The Pirate Captain and Lieutenant bring some crew to the other side of the same island to bury some of their plunder. They  then plan to murder the other pirates: "Dead men tell no tales." But first, Fairbanks appears as the "Black Pirate", who offers to join their company and fight their best man to prove his worth. After much fighting, the Black Pirate kills the Pirate Captain. The Pirate Lieutenant sneers, and says there is more to being a pirate than sword tricks. To further prove his worth, the Black Pirate says he will capture the next ship of prey single-handed, which he does. He then uses his wits to prevent the pirates from blowing up the ship along with the crew and passengers, suggesting that they hold the ship for ransom.
When a woman is discovered on board, the Pirate Lieutenant claims her. In love at first sight, the Black Pirate finds a way to temporarily save her from this fate by presenting her as a "princess" and urging the crew to use her as a hostage to ensure their ransom will be paid, as long as she remains "spotless and unharmed".
The pirates cheer the Black Pirate, and want to name him captain. The Pirate Lieutenant jeers but consents to wait to see if the ransom is paid by noon the next day. However, he secretly has a confederate destroy the ransom ship later that night to ensure it will not return.  Then, when the Black Pirate is caught trying to release the woman, the Pirate Lieutenant exposes him as a traitor and the pirates force him to walk the plank.
At noon the next day, with the ransom ship having failed to show, the Pirate Lieutenant goes to the woman to claim his prize.  But just then, the Black Pirate, who with the help of the sympathetic one-armed pirate MacTavish had survived being sent overboard, returns leading troops to stop the pirates. After a long fight, the pirates are routed. In the end, the Black Pirate is revealed to be a Duke, and the "Princess" he loves a noble Lady. Even MacTavish is moved to tears of joy by the happy ending.','["Albert Parker"]','["Douglas Fairbanks","Jack Cunningham"]','["Douglas Fairbanks","Billie Dove","Tempe Pigott"]','["Adventure","Action"]','7.1','["tt0011439","tt0020030","tt0012752","tt0016641","tt0014532","tt0016669","tt0016481","tt0018054","tt0020269","tt0017416","tt0011841","tt0016884"]','["Pirates; revenge; adventure; sea"]','[{"url":"/TheBlackPirate1926DouglasFairbanksSRAndy.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/TheBlackPirate1926DouglasFairbanksSRAndy_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/TheBlackPirate1926DouglasFairbanksSRAndy_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','TheBlackPirate1926DouglasFairbanksSRAndy',32958,'Q2377258','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

LaRue is seeking to advance his own power, and he arbitrarily sets a tax on all wagons using the Santa Fe Trail (yes, check a map of the Republic of Texas before statehood), and orders Captain Colt and his Sergeant, Gabby Whittaker (George "Gabby" Hayes), to enforce this ruling. Colt, knowing that if he refuses he will be in no position to combat LaRue''s outrageous plans, plays along. Among the first of the freighter wagon trains to be taxed is those belonging to Jane Tabor (Jacqueline Wells, before she became Julie Bishop) . When she and her old-time scout, Hank Purdy (Si Jenks), refuse to pay the tax, Colt places her under arrest and brings her before LaRue. But Jane charms LaRue into allowing her a monopoly of the freight lines using the Santa Fe Trail. Secretly, she is bent upon deposing LaRue, who was responsible for the death of her father. Colt misunderstands her motives, while she is equally contemptuous of his being a tool of LaRue. The other wagon train owners revolt and backed by Colt and Hank Purdy, who has deserted Jane because of her apparent bargain with LaRue, they use force to get the freight wagons through. Purdy is wounded and Jane comes to his aid. Through Gabby, Jane and Roy''s misunderstanding are corrected, and they work together until LaRue''s treachery is exposed and he is brought to justice.','["Joseph Kane"]','["Gerald Geraghty","Stuart Anthony"]','["Roy Rogers","George ''Gabby'' Hayes","Julie Bishop"]','["Music","Western"]','6.5','["tt0032346","tt0031051","tt0032274","tt0033367","tt0038611","tt0030742","tt0031889","tt0034832","tt0040644","tt0031958","tt0030006","tt0030910"]','["Western; Roy Rogers; George Hayes"]','[{"url":"/TheRangerAndTheLady.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/TheRangerAndTheLady_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/TheRangerAndTheLady_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','TheRangerAndTheLady',9582,'Q7759413','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

One night, fleeing from a police street sweep, she hides in the room of a gambler (Zhang  Zhizhi).  He forces her to stay the night with him for not betraying her to the police, and she has no choice but to submit. Later, however, he and two of his pals show up at her place. He makes it clear that he considers her his property.  The woman attempts to flee, but the gambler tracks her down and frightens her by claiming to have sold her son to punish her.  The gambler returns the child, but he has made his point; she realizes she cannot protect her son from him and gives in. However, she manages to hide some of her earnings behind a loose brick in her wall and saves the money for the education of her son.
When the son is about 5 or 6, she enrolls him in a school. Soon, other parents learn that the boy''s mother is a prostitute, and complain to the school. The principal pays a visit to the protagonist to find the truth behind the accusations of her occupation. He discovers that she is indeed a prostitute. Just as he sets his mind on expelling the boy, she cries and shows how genuine and real her love for her child was. The principal finally gets swayed by the mother as she says that although she doesn''t have a good background, but she believes that she has the right to give her son the best she can provide. The principal realizes that the right thing to do was  not to expel the child for his mother''s background. But he was unable to persuade the other members of the school committee to agree with his stance. Therefore, he resigns from his position as a principal and the little boy is expelled in the end. 
The mother plans to move to a different place with her son where no one knows who they are. When she tries to take her savings out from the hole in the wall, she realizes that gambler Zhang has found her money and took it away. She asks him to return her money, but he laughs and informs her that he spent it. She gets extremely angry and kills him by smashing a bottle on his head
In the end of the film, the protagonist is sentenced to 12 years in jail because of her murder of gambler Zhang.

McAllan informs the group that the "Allanite steel" he developed, along with a "radium drill" developed by his friend Frederick "Robbie" Robbins, makes it possible to construct an undersea tunnel linking England with the United States. Though the group is initially skeptical, the backing of Lloyd and his associate Mostyn convinces the group to buy shares in the project.
Three years into construction of the tunnel, McAllan is a worldwide celebrity, but his work keeps him from his devoted wife Ruth and their young son Geoffrey. Called away to New York, he is informed that the people are losing faith in the project. Lloyd needs to have him use his fame to get support. Lloyd''s attractive daughter Varlia, who is secretly in love with McAllan, keeps him company to intensify the attention of the press.
The photos of the couple add to Ruth''s sense of isolation, and she decides to work in the tunnel as a nurse. There she is affected by an unknown gas afflicting the workers and loses her eyesight. Worried that her husband no longer loves her and not wanting him to stay with her out of pity, Ruth leaves McAllan, taking their son with her. Heartbroken at her unexplained departure, McAllan throws himself into the project, alienating Robbins in the process.
Years pass. Though the cost of the tunnel in lives and money continues to mount, the British prime minister and American president eagerly anticipate its completion and the unity and peace they promise it will bring. Ruth lives in the countryside with her now-grown son, who lobbies Robbins to find him a job working in the tunnel. The tunnel is nearing completion, but the workers encounter a submarine volcano that will necessitate a detour. McAllan needs more money to establish a detour, but is opposed by Grellier, an arms manufacturer, and Mostyn. The two men earlier manipulated the stock market to become the controlling shareholders in the company. Lloyd suspects that Grellier and Mostyn plan to use the delay to depress stock prices again, and this time gain total ownership of the tunnel. However, Varlia convinces Mostyn to fund further construction by promising him the one thing he has always wanted, but never gotten: her hand in marriage. Though the project goes forward, Grellier has Mostyn killed for backing out of their deal.
Despite the renewed effort, samples indicate the volcano may be too large to drill around. The drill breaks through to volcanic gases that kill hundreds of workers, including Geoffrey.

('tt0056983','free','Dementia 13 (1963)','1963','1h 15min','While out rowing in the middle of a lake after dark, John Haloran and his young wife Louise argue about his rich mother''s will. Louise is upset that everything is currently designated to go to charity in the name of a mysterious "Kathleen". The argument, combined with the exertion of rowing the boat, causes John to have a heart attack. He informs Louise that, should he die before his mother, Louise will receive none of the inheritance, after which he promptly dies. Thinking quickly, the scheming Louise dumps his fresh corpse over the boat''s side, where it sinks to the bottom of the lake. Her plan is to pretend that he is still alive so that she can ingratiate her way into the will. She types up a letter to her mother-in-law, Lady Haloran, inviting herself to the family''s castle in Ireland while her husband is "away on business".

At the castle, she immediately notices that things are a little odd. John''s two brothers, Billy, and Richard, take part in a bizarre, ritualistic ceremony with their mother, part of a yearly tribute to their deceased younger sister Kathleen, who died years before in a freak drowning accident. Lady Haloran still mourns for her daughter, and during the ceremony, she faints dead away as she does every year. As Louise helps her mother-in-law into the castle, Lady Haloran tells her that she fainted because one of the fresh flowers she had thrown died as it touched Kathleen''s grave.
Louise, realizing that Lady Haloran is emotionally overwrought and superstitious, devises a plan to convince the old woman that Kathleen is trying to communicate with her from beyond the grave. The plan involves stealing some of the dead girl''s old toys and placing them at the bottom of the estate''s pond, where they will float to the surface in a ghostly way during the middle of the day. That night, Louise swims underwater and begins placing the toys, as planned. She is shocked to see what appears to be Kathleen''s perfectly preserved corpse at the bottom of the pond. Horrified, she surfaces and is abruptly attacked with an axe by an unknown assailant; her killer drags Louise''s bloody corpse away.
Concerned family doctor Justin Caleb arrives and becomes determined to solve the mystery. He intensely questions the family. The murderer, meanwhile, strikes again, decapitating a man named Simon, who has been poaching on the estate. Dr. Caleb has the pond drained, revealing a stone statue shrine, engraved with the words "Forgive Me, Kathleen". The following night, Lady Haloran is attacked by a shadowy figure, but she eludes him and collapses in the castle''s courtyard.
Dr. Caleb finally uses an obscure nursery rhyme ("Fishy, fishy, in a brook, Daddy caught you on a hook"), recited by Billy under hypnosis, to help him discover Louise''s frozen corpse hidden away in a meat locker. Next to the bloody body is a wax figure of Kathleen. Dr. Caleb places the figure in a public square to lure out the killer. Taking the bait, a gibbering Billy, who has gone insane with guilt over causing the death of his sister Kathleen, attempts to kill Richard''s fiancée Kane with an axe. Dr. Caleb saves her life by shooting Billy to death with a pistol he was carrying in his pocket.','["Francis Ford Coppola"]','["Francis Ford Coppola","Jack Hill"]','["William Campbell","Luana Anders","Bart Patton"]','["Horror","Thriller"]','5.7','["tt0057569","tt5806506","tt0051755","tt0153167","tt0084445","tt0061209","tt0056355","tt0053719","tt0064873","tt0481797","tt0053103","tt0055830"]',NULL,'[{"url":"/RogerCormansDementiaThirteen720p_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"},{"url":"/dementia13-720p.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/dementia13-720p.webm","format":"WebM"}]','RogerCormansDementiaThirteen720p',23377,'Q1185312','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Shell owed him money, he says, and two strangers known as Smiling Man and Roper gave him a gun to confront Shell. He wound up unconscious and next to Shell''s bullet-riddled body.
Horse doubts the boy''s story, though youngest daughter Meagan believes it. At a barn-warming party for Pat, word comes that his parents have been found murdered. A livid Pat is ready to hang Cooncat for the crime. Horse talks him out of it, creating a rift between the two old friends.

The group, consisting of scientist Marlowe Cragis (Baruch Lumet), his research assistant Radford Baines (Gordon McLendon), the scientist''s daughter Ann (Ingrid Goude), her recent fiancé Jerry Farrel (Ken Curtis), and a servant Mario (Alfred DeSoto), welcome the captain and his first mate. They also subtly resist the visitors staying overnight, even though a hurricane is approaching. Thorne goes with them to their compound, while Griswold stays with the boat, saying that he will come ashore later.
The situation in the compound is less than safe. During cocktails, Thorne becomes aware of a life-threatening situation to all of them: Marlowe Cragis has been performing well-meaning research on serums and uses shrews as test animals. The doctor''s purpose is to shrink humans to half their size in order to reduce world hunger, because (he reasons) being smaller, humans will consume less food in a world with a limited food supply. Unfortunately, the doctor''s experiments have created mutant giant shrews that have escaped and are now reproducing in the wild, growing larger and more voracious day-by-day. The group must now barricade themselves inside their compound every evening before the sun sets, so that the shrews will kill each other once they have eaten every other living animal on the island.
Thorne and Ann begin to be attracted to each other, causing Jerry to become jealous, despite ruining his relationship with Ann. The giant shrews have run out of smaller animals to hunt and devour. When Griswald comes ashore, the mutants attack and kill him. After closing in on the compound and killing the available livestock, one of the mutant shrews breaks a window and hides in the basement. Mario and Thorne go downstairs when they hear the noise. Mario discovers the mutant and shoots at it, but not before it bites him. The giant shrew is immediately killed by Thorne. Mario quickly expires from the mutant''s bite. Radford later discovers a highly toxic venom in the dead shrew''s saliva, the result, it turns out, of the poisoned bait he had placed in the wild to kill them off. Another mutant schrew is able to get in, and it bites Radford. As he dies, Radford records the symptoms on his typewriter, right up to the moment of his death.
As the giant shrews begin to chew through the compound walls, the group makes impromptu armor by lashing together empty 50 gallon oil drums. Now crouched down inside them, they duckwalk towards the beach shoreline. Due to his claustrophobia, Jerry remains behind, isolating himself on the roof before watching the mutants chase after the lashed-together drums. He attempts to flee but is cut off and killed by another group of shrews. Thorne, Ann, and Marlowe manage to reach the shoreline and swim out to the boat.

('tt0042782','free','The Nevadan (1950)','1950','1h 21min','United States Marshal Andrew Barclay (Randolph Scott) arranges the escape of outlaw Tom Tanner (Forrest Tucker) in order to locate the $250,000 in gold stolen by Tanner in stagecoach robbery. Tanner notices he''s being followed by Barclay, whose appearance suggests he is a greenhorn. Tanner ambushes Barclay and forces him to trade clothes and accompany him to a bank, where Tanner retrieves an envelope containing a map from a safe deposit box showing the location of the stolen gold.
On the road, Tanner and Barclay are stopped by two brothers, Jeff and Bart, who pull their guns and demand the map. To Tanner''s surprise, Barclay disarms the brothers and takes their horses. Later he explains that he is a fugitive just like Tanner and proposes that they work together as a team. That night, while Barclay is asleep, Tanner rides on without him.
The next day, Barclay stops at a ranch owned by beautiful Karen Galt (Dorothy Malone) and trades his lame horse for a fresh one. He continues on to the nearby town of Twin Forks, which is run by Karen''s father, Edward Galt (George Macready). At the local saloon, Barclay sees Tanner who pretends not to know him. Galt watches their exchange and later questions Barclay about Tanner''s stolen gold, which was never discovered following the robbery. When Barclay denies knowing Tanner, Galt orders his henchmen to beat him up.
Later that night, Tanner kills an intruder in his room. In an effort to force Tanner to reveal the location of the gold, Galt sets him up, making it look like cold-blooded murder rather than self defense. After being taken to jail, Tanner escapes with the help of Barclay after agreeing to share the gold. The two men ride out to the old Galt ranch, now used as a pasture for sick horses. When Karen discovers them hiding there, Barclay takes her aside and reveals that he is in fact a U.S. Marshal. 
Meanwhile, Galt recognizes the escape horses used by Tanner and Barclay as belonging to his ranch. Later he questions his daughter about them, and she reveals Barclay''s secret, unaware that her father is after the gold himself. When Karen overhears Galt plotting with his henchmen, however, she realizes that Barclay''s life is in danger and rides to the hideout to warn him. One of Galt''s men follows her, however, and summons the others to the old Galt ranch. When they arrive, Karen meets them with gunfire, which gives Barclay and Tanner a head start on their escape. 
Galt catches up with his daughter and has her put in custody while he and the others track Barclay and Tanner to an old mine shaft where Tanner has hidden the stolen gold. During the ensuing gunfight, Galt and his men are killed. Barclay reveals that Tanner was allowed to escape so that the gold could be retrieved. When the mine shaft caves in, Barclay overcomes Tanner and takes his prisoner back to jail. Karen knows he will return to her because he has left his horse in her care.','["Gordon Douglas"]','["George W. George","George F.

('tt0055230','free','Night Tide (1961)','1961','1h 26min','Seaman Johnny Drake (Dennis Hopper), while on shore leave in San Diego, meets a girl named Mora (Linda Lawson) in a local jazz club. Mora tells him that she makes her living appearing as a mermaid in a sideshow attraction on the boardwalk, operated by a Captain Murdock (Gavin Muir). She lives in an apartment above the amusement park that houses the merry-go-round. Soon, she and Johnny fall in love. Johnny becomes acquainted with the merry-go-round operator and his daughter, who warns Johnny that Mora may be dangerous. Her two previous boyfriends have both drowned under mysterious circumstances.
As Mora and Johnny become closer, Mora tells him that she believes she is a Siren, one of the mythical mermaids who, according to legend, lure sailors to their deaths. For some time, she has been followed and approached by a mysterious and seemingly sinister woman (Marjorie Cameron) whom she believes is one of the Sirens, calling her return to the sea to fulfill her destiny. Mora believes she is responsible for the deaths of her former boyfriends, and warns Johnny that it might be better for him to stop seeing her. Johnny is unable to believe Mora is capable of killing anyone, thinking that she must be suffering from a delusion. On the day of the full moon, Mora invites Johnny on a scuba diving outing. After briefly trying to dissuade her, he somewhat uneasily accepts. During the dive, Mora cuts Johnny''s air hose, forcing him to surface.  Remaining below, she swims away into the depths of the sea.
Johnny is devastated, but returns to the boardwalk the following evening and goes to the sideshow, where he finds Captain Murdock at the entrance, as usual, calling to passersby. When the Captain looks away, Johnny reaches up to the stand, buys a ticket and enters the sideshow tent. Peering into the tank, he sees Mora, only now, instead of lying at the bottom of the tank and languidly combing her long hair, she floats on the surface, her lifeless eyes staring upward. In a moment, Captain Murdock appears, brandishing a gun. He tells Johnny that it was he who killed Mora''s former boyfriends because he couldn''t bear the thought of her leaving him. Murdock fires at Johnny, but misses. The gunshots attract the attention of two policemen patrolling the boardwalk, and Murdock and Johnny are taken into custody.
At the police station, Murdock confesses to killing Mora''s former boyfriends. He then relates the tale of how he found Mora, a young and helpless orphan wandering about on a Greek island, and adopted her. Knowing she would grow up and fearing that one day she would leave him, he planted the idea in her mind that she was a mermaid, incapable of living the life of a normal woman, as a way of binding her to him forever. Eventually, she did grow up and began to attract the attention of young men. Realizing that she was being drawn away from him, Murdock killed her former boyfriends out of desperation and let her think that she had caused their deaths.
While Johnny understands and accepts the Captain''s account, one mystery remains: Who is the strange, elusive woman in black, who seemed to be following Mora and whom Mora thought was calling her to return to the sea? Captain Murdock denies any knowledge of such a woman, while the police lieutenant thinks Murdock may be protecting the woman.
The shore patrol arrives to take Johnny into custody and return him to his ship. The merry-go-round operator''s daughter, who has taken an interest in him, visits the police station to bid him goodbye. He tells her that he will try to return on a future leave.','["Curtis Harrington"]','["Curtis Harrington","Curtis Harrington"]','["Dennis Hopper","Linda Lawson","Gavin Muir"]','["Horror","Romance","Thriller"]','6.4','["tt0060877","tt0060968","tt0247527","tt0098190","tt0361953","tt0119842","tt0360140","tt0336618","tt2056733","tt0047976","tt3030920","tt0080139"]','["horror;mermaid;Dennis hopper;feature films"]','[{"url":"/NightTide1961.mp4","format":"h.264"},{"url":"/NightTide1961_512kb.mp4","format":"512Kb MPEG4"},{"url":"/NightTide1961_archive.torrent","format":"Archive BitTorrent"}]','NightTide1961',13068,'Q7033493','wp',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
